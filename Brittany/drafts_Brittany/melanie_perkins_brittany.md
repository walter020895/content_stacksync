# Brittany — The Ring

## Angle: The full arc of Melanie Perkins — from Perth (the most isolated city on Earth) through 100+ rejections and a kitesurfing pitch to building a $42B company — told through the $30 engagement ring and the pledge to give away most of the wealth, filtered through Brittany's admiration for founders who build for purpose

| User's Insight | "I like women who drive massive corporate value while supporting corporate social responsibility. I care a lot about philanthropy specifically with children, education, poverty/hunger, and the environment." |
| Topic | Melanie Perkins' origin story and her pledge to give away most of Canva's value |
| Angle | Brittany telling a story she studied — the $30 ring as the symbol of who this person really is, the hustle nobody saw, and the philanthropy that proves the ring wasn't just a detail |
| Hook Type | Magician (the $30 ring + $42B company create immediate contrast and emotional stun) |
| Story Structure | Ring (present) → Origin (Perth) → Mother's yearbook → Fusion Books → Rejections → Kitesurfing → Canva growth → Two-Step Plan → Philanthropy → Ring callback → Personal close |
| Psych Triggers | Underdog (Perth, 100+ rejections, cashed the first cheque because they needed the money) + Contrast ($30 ring vs $42B company) + Generosity (80%+ pledge, $100M GiveDirectly) |

**Reader Value:** Learns the personal origin story behind Canva's CEO — the isolation of Perth, the rejection gauntlet, the kitesurfing gambit, and the pledge to give away billions — told by an operations leader who values founders who build to give back.

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Canva's CEO wears a $30 engagement ring from a market in Turkey.

Her company is worth $42 billion. She and her husband have pledged to give away most of it.

I needed to know who does that. So I went and read everything.

### HOOK B

Canva's CEO taught herself to kitesurf because a VC she wanted to meet ran an investor retreat where everyone kitesurfed.

She'd never done it in her life. She got the meeting. And she got the round.

I needed to know who does that.

### HOOK C

Canva's CEO wrote a two-step plan when the company hit $40 billion.

Step 1: become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Step 2: "Do the most good we can."

I went and read everything about her.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Number Hero — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][DATA]**
Dark bg (#161616). Dominant element: "$30" in massive type (200px+, IBM Plex Sans 600, white). Below in smaller #0043CE: "Engagement ring. $42B company." The $30 creates immediate confusion — what costs $30 in a business context? Image-hook loop: reader sees $30 → reads about the ring, the rejections, the pledge → second look at $30 carries the weight of everything she chose NOT to buy. Mobile-first: "$30" readable at any size.

**Option B: Number Hero — SQUARE 1:1 — [TYPE][LOGO]**
Light bg (#F4F4F4). Dominant: "$30 / $42,000,000,000" stacked vertically. The gap between the two numbers IS the concept. Canva logo bottom-right. Clean, no clutter. Image-hook loop: reader sees the gap → reads the story → second look at both numbers hits harder knowing the pledge.

**Option C: Text-only**
Melanie's story has enough vivid details (ring, kitesurfing, cheque). Maximizes feed space. Best for intimate feel.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

Canva's CEO wears a $30 engagement ring from a market in Turkey.

Her company is worth $42 billion. She and her husband have pledged to give away most of it.

I needed to know who does that. So I went and read everything.

Melanie Perkins grew up in Perth, Western Australia, one of the most isolated cities on Earth. She watched her mother spend hundreds of hours wrestling with Adobe InDesign just to lay out the school yearbook.

At 19, she dropped out of university and started a yearbook company in her mother's living room. Their first customer deposit was $100. They thought about framing the cheque. They cashed it because they needed the money.

That company became the largest yearbook publisher in Australia.

Then she started flying 15 hours to San Francisco, sleeping on her brother's living room floor, pitching investors, and flying 15 hours back. She did this more than a hundred times. Almost every one said no.

So she taught herself to kitesurf because a VC she wanted to meet ran an investor retreat where everyone kitesurfed. She'd never done it in her life. She got the meeting. And she got the round.

From there, Canva went from $4.4 million in revenue to $3.5 billion. Profitable for eight straight years.

But y'all, here's what stopped me.

When the company hit $40 billion, Melanie wrote a two-step plan. Step 1: become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Step 2: "Do the most good we can."

She and her husband pledged over 80% of their personal stake to the Canva Foundation. Their largest single commitment: $100 million to GiveDirectly, the biggest gift in the organization's history. It reaches 185,000 people in Malawi.

She once said: "It has felt strange when people refer to us as 'billionaires' as it has never felt like our money."

And I love that the woman who built a $42 billion company still wears that $30 ring.

That's who I want to learn from.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "I needed to know who does that" + "So I went and read everything" (Brittany as curious narrator). "But y'all, here's what stopped me" (signature + personal bridge). "And I love that" (Brittany's enthusiasm signature). "That's who I want to learn from" (personal verdict). Medium-to-long flowing sentences, storytelling mode. The kitesurfing section uses shorter sentences for pacing.
- **Storytelling architecture**: Every consecutive sentence connected by Cause→Effect, Setup→Payoff, Contrast, or Escalation. The mother watching InDesign → Melanie starting a yearbook company (cause→effect). Cashing the cheque instead of framing it (setup→payoff). 100+ rejections → kitesurfing gambit (cause→effect). Tested with One-Line Test and But/Therefore Rule per `20_storytelling_rules.md`.
- **Open loop**: Hook opens "Who wears a $30 ring while running a $42B company and pledges to give most of it away?" → Closes through the full story, culminating in the pledge + ring callback at the end. The ring bookends the post.
- **Ring as bookend**: The $30 ring opens the hook (creates curiosity) and closes the post (carries emotional weight). On first read, the ring is surprising. On second read, after the pledge and the "it never felt like our money" quote, the ring becomes proof of character. This is the image-hook loop applied to narrative.
- **Bridge from hustle to philanthropy**: "But y'all, here's what stopped me." = Brittany re-enters as narrator. Signals: the growth story was impressive ($4M to $3.5B), but something deeper is coming. Opens micro-loop → answered by the two-step plan + pledge + GiveDirectly.
- **Closer architecture**: Three-part close: (1) Quote: "It has never felt like our money." = Melanie's own words, character reveal. (2) "And I love that the woman who built a $42 billion company still wears that $30 ring." = personal, warm, ring callback + contrast. (3) "That's who I want to learn from." = verdict.
- **Timeline**: Only moves forward: Perth → mother's yearbook → age 19 Fusion Books → largest in Australia → SF flights/rejections → kitesurfing → seed round → Canva revenue growth → $40B two-step plan → 80% pledge → $100M GiveDirectly → quote → ring callback → closer. No backward jumps.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: Canva's CEO. Single question: "Who wears a $30 ring while running a $42B company?" Context Lean: "Canva's CEO wears a $30 engagement ring from a market in Turkey." (57 chars) > Scroll Stop: "Her company is worth $42 billion. She and her husband have pledged to give away most of it." > Snap Back: "I needed to know who does that." Fits mobile: yes.
- **AI slop check**: No em dashes. No colon staging. No flip formulas. No symmetry patterns. No banned words. "But y'all" = earned bridge. "And I love that" = Brittany marker. "She got the meeting. And she got the round." = setup→payoff, earned fragment pair.
- **Rhythm variation**: "They cashed it because they needed the money." (8 words — payoff after setup). "Almost every one said no." (5 words). "She'd never done it in her life." (7 words). "She got the meeting. And she got the round." (fragments — pacing). "Profitable for eight straight years." (5 words after revenue arc).
- **Show don't tell**: Poverty: "cashed it because they needed the money" SHOWS it. Determination: 100+ flights, 15 hours each, sleeping on brother's floor SHOWS it. Creativity: kitesurfing gambit SHOWS resourcefulness. Values: $30 ring + pledge SHOWS character. Never labeled.
- **Ego bait**: Full post dedicated to Melanie Perkins. Publishing: @mention Melanie Perkins and Canva. Checklist: proud of story, would share, young women founders feel seen, philanthropic communities feel seen.

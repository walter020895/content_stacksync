### HOOK A (Recommended)

ServiceNow's President once stood in an empty apartment with packed suitcases and no plan.

She'd quit her job and given up her lease to move with her boyfriend. He broke up with her standing right there.

I needed to know what happened after that. So I went and read everything.

### HOOK B

ServiceNow's President started working at 12. Babysitting, then waitressing.

She put herself through SUNY Albany with that money. When she graduated, she said she "never imagined, as a woman, that being a CFO was possible."

I needed to know the rest of that story.

### HOOK C

ServiceNow went from $50 billion to $200 billion in five years. $3.5 billion in revenue to $10.6 billion.

The woman running the finances started on January 1, 2020. Weeks before the pandemic. New to software.

I went and read everything about her.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Number Hero — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][LOGO]**
Dark bg (#161616). Dominant element: "$200B" in massive type (200px+, IBM Plex Sans 600, white). Below in smaller #0043CE: "ServiceNow. Five years. One CFO." ServiceNow logo bottom-right, monochrome white, 96px. The $200B creates intrigue — who built this? Image-hook loop: reader sees $200B → reads about the empty apartment, the breakup, the rebuild → second look at $200B carries the weight of everything she walked through to get there. Mobile-first: "$200B" readable at any size.

**Option B: Number Hero — SQUARE 1:1 — [TYPE][DATA]**
Light bg (#F4F4F4). Dominant: "$50B → $200B" with arrow in #0043CE. Below: "2020–2025." ServiceNow logo bottom-right. The gap + the compressed timeframe IS the concept. Image-hook loop: reader sees the numbers → reads the story → second look at 2020 hits harder knowing she started weeks before the pandemic.

**Option C: Text-only**
The apartment story is emotionally visceral enough without a visual. Maximizes feed space. Best for intimate, personal-story feel.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

ServiceNow's President once stood in an empty apartment with packed suitcases and no plan.

She'd quit her job and given up her lease to move with her boyfriend. He broke up with her standing right there.

I needed to know what happened after that. So I went and read everything.

Gina Mastantuono grew up on Long Island with three brothers. First in her family to go to college. She started working at 12, babysitting, then waitressing, and saved enough to put herself through school.

She chose accounting at SUNY Albany because a friend told her it was "recession-proof." When she graduated, she said she "never imagined, as a woman, that being a CFO was possible."

Then came the apartment. She'd quit a job where she was up for a promotion, packed everything, and he ended it before they left.

So instead of calling her old boss, she bought a one-way ticket and traveled alone for six months. On that trip, she met her husband Luke.

From there she rebuilt. At Revlon, the stock was trading at $1. She interviewed for an assistant controller role. They made her International CFO instead.

At Ingram Micro, her husband gave up his own job so she could take the CFO role. Their kids were 2 and 5.

She started at ServiceNow on January 1, 2020. Weeks before the pandemic. New to software. Her boss was new too.

Five years later, $55 billion became over $200 billion. Revenue went from $3.5 billion to nearly $11 billion.

But y'all, that's not what stopped me.

In 2023, every tech company was cutting thousands. ServiceNow didn't lay off a single person. She saw the warning signs early, pulled back on hiring, and filled 1,500 open roles through internal moves instead.

She also led a $100 million Racial Equity Fund for homeownership and entrepreneurship across ten U.S. regions.

And I love that the woman running a $200 billion company chose to fill 1,500 roles before she ever cut one.

That's who I want to learn from.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "I needed to know what happened after that" + "So I went and read everything" (Brittany as curious narrator). "But y'all, that's not what stopped me" (signature + personal bridge). "And I love that" (Brittany's enthusiasm signature). "That's who I want to learn from" (personal verdict). Medium-to-long flowing sentences in the career arc. Shorter sentences for emotional beats (the breakup, the Revlon surprise).
- **Storytelling architecture**: Every consecutive sentence connected by Cause→Effect, Setup→Payoff, Contrast, or Escalation. "chose accounting because recession-proof" → "never imagined being a CFO" (setup→irony). "packed everything, and he ended it" (setup→reversal). "Instead of calling her old boss, she bought a one-way ticket" (setup→surprise). "interviewed for assistant controller, they made her International CFO" (setup→payoff). Tested with One-Line Test and But/Therefore Rule per `20_storytelling_rules.md`.
- **Open loop**: Hook opens "What happened after she stood in that empty apartment?" → Answered by the full career arc: solo travel → met husband → Revlon → Ingram Micro → ServiceNow → $200B. The empty apartment is the question. The $200B is the answer.
- **Bridge from transformation to values**: "But y'all, that's not what stopped me." = Brittany re-enters as narrator. Signals: the $200B growth was impressive, but something about her character matters more. Opens micro-loop → answered by zero-layoff decision + Racial Equity Fund.
- **Closer architecture**: Two-part close: (1) "And I love that the woman running a $200 billion company chose to fill 1,500 roles before she ever cut one." = specific, warm, ties the $200B scale to the zero-layoff decision. (2) "That's who I want to learn from." = verdict.
- **Timeline**: Only moves forward: Long Island → age 12 working → SUNY Albany → early career → the breakup → solo travel → meets Luke → Revlon → Ingram Micro → ServiceNow (Jan 1, 2020) → $200B → 2023 zero layoffs → Racial Equity Fund → closer. No backward jumps. The breakup is the chronological center: everything before it is setup, everything after is rebuild.
- **Most vulnerable hook in the campaign**: This post starts from a PERSONAL crisis (romantic breakup), not a professional one. It's the most emotionally exposed entry point in all six posts. That's deliberate — it matches Brittany's willingness to talk about the human behind the title.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: ServiceNow's President. Single question: "What happened after the empty apartment?" Context Lean: "ServiceNow's President once stood in an empty apartment with packed suitcases and no plan." (85 chars — long, but the image is so vivid it earns the length) > Scroll Stop: "He broke up with her standing right there." > Snap Back: "I needed to know what happened after that." Fits mobile: yes.
- **AI slop check**: No em dashes. No colon staging. No flip formulas. No symmetry patterns. No banned words. "But y'all" = earned bridge. "And I love that" = Brittany marker. "She interviewed for an assistant controller role. They made her International CFO instead." = setup→payoff, clean.
- **Rhythm variation**: "He broke up with her standing right there." (8 words — gut punch). "Her boss was new too." (5 words). "$55 billion became over $200 billion." (6 words). "Their kids were 2 and 5." (6 words — human detail, stops the career momentum for one beat).
- **Show don't tell**: Resilience: "bought a one-way ticket and traveled alone for six months" SHOWS it. Poverty: "started working at 12" SHOWS it. Surprise: "interviewed for assistant controller, made International CFO" SHOWS competence. Partnership: "her husband gave up his own job" SHOWS family sacrifice. Character: zero layoffs + internal moves SHOWS values.
- **Ego bait**: Full post dedicated to Gina Mastantuono. Publishing: @mention Gina Mastantuono and ServiceNow. Checklist: proud of story, would share, first-generation college students feel seen, working parents feel seen.

# Brittany — I'm not just a positive person

## Angle: Positive energy as practiced discipline, not personality — and why it changes a team

---

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "If you practice enthusiasm, if you practice encouragement, it becomes like second nature to you." — Brittany, directly from the transcript. She described the morning standup ritual explicitly. |
| Topic | Intentional positivity as a leadership practice, not a personality trait |
| Angle | The hospitality-trained leader who learned that the energy you bring to a room is a choice — and made it deliberately |
| Hook Type | Contrarian (challenges the idea that positivity is innate, not earned) |
| Story Structure | Common assumption → The correction → How she practices it → What it does for a team → The principle |
| Psych Triggers | Validation (you can build this, it's not something you either have or don't) + Tribal Identity (for leaders who want to shape culture intentionally) |
| Visual Format | Text-only |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)

People think I'm just a positive person.

That's not exactly right.

I'm someone who decided to be one, a long time ago.

### HOOK B

I used to watch rooms change when certain people walked in.

Then I realized I could be that person.

So I started practicing.

### HOOK C

Positive energy is not a personality.

It's a skill.

And like any skill, you get better at it the more you use it.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Text-only**
This is a quiet conviction post. The intimacy of the hospitality story carries it.

**Option B: Quote Portrait card**
Brittany's photo + quote: "If you practice encouragement long enough, it becomes second nature." — her actual words. Needs: Brittany's photo.

**Option C: Typographic Manifesto card**
Dark bg. Large: "POSITIVITY IS A PRACTICE." Smaller: "Not a personality." Simple. Shareable. Good image-hook loop with Hook C.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

People think I'm just a positive person.

That's not exactly right.

I'm someone who decided to be one, a long time ago.

Back in hospitality, I started paying attention to the rooms I walked into. How they shifted after I arrived — not because I was doing anything dramatic, just because I'd made a quiet decision: I would bring the kind of energy I wanted around me.

And so I practice it. Every morning before standups. In the way I open a difficult email. In how I choose my first sentence when something goes sideways.

This isn't naivety, and it's not the kind of positivity that pretends problems don't exist. I still flag the contract issue. I still have the hard conversation. I just try to bring a certain steadiness to it.

And what I've noticed, after years of this: when you practice something consistently enough, it stops feeling like practice. It just becomes the way you move through a day.

What that does to a team, especially one operating under pressure: it raises the floor. When people know that no matter what happened, the conversation they're about to have won't be charged with panic or blame, they come to you earlier. They bring you the small problem before it grows into one that can't be fixed quietly.

Positive energy is a leadership tool.

Like any tool, you get better at it the more you use it.

## AUDIT: GO — 8.3

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| D1 ICP Relevance | 7 |
| D2 Factual Accuracy | 10 |
| D3 Readability | 9 |
| D4 AI Slop | 9 |
| D5 Reading Pleasure | 9 |
| D6 Reader Value | 7 |

**Notes:** Strongest voice post in the batch — sounds most purely like Brittany. "They come to you earlier. They bring you the small problem before it grows into one that can't be fixed quietly." is the best specific benefit line in all 7 drafts. D6 slightly lower because the reader can't DO something immediately — but the mindset shift is real and applicable. D1 lower because it's pure Reach content with no ICP pipeline connection.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: Quiet hospitality observation, "And so I practice it" connector, "This isn't naivety" honest caveat, "And what I've noticed" (not "here's what I found"), warm leadership insight close
- **Hook (Kallaway)**: Context Lean: "People think I'm just a positive person." (41 chars) → Scroll Stop: "That's not exactly right." (25 chars) → Snap Back: "I'm someone who decided to be one, a long time ago." Total before see more: 66 chars ✓ — very clean mobile preview
- **Word count**: ~225 words
- **AI slop check**: Clean. "And what I've noticed" avoids "Here's what I found" slop. No contrast flip formulas. No em dashes.
- **Connector pass**: "And so I practice it." (logical bridge, Brittany-confirmed connector), "And what I've noticed, after years of this:" (grounding, specific to the topic)
- **Redundancy sweep**: PASS — the "practice → second nature" insight is stated once (body) and the close builds the consequence, not restates the method

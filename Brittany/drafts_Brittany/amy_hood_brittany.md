# Brittany — The Plaque

## Angle: The full arc of Amy Hood — from a small-town Kentucky upbringing through an unglamorous entry at Microsoft to surviving the most chaotic first year in CFO history, then architecting a 10x transformation — told through Brittany's lens of admiration for the person who does the hardest work without the loudest title

|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "I like women who drive massive corporate value while supporting corporate social responsibility. I care a lot about philanthropy specifically with children, education, poverty/hunger, and the environment." |
| Topic | Amy Hood's origin story and rise to longest-serving CFO of Microsoft |
| Angle | Brittany telling a story she studied — the survival year nobody headlines, the unglamorous climb, the transformation that happened because the CFO moved sideways instead of up |
| Hook Type | Magician (the plaque detail + "surviving" create pattern interrupt and curiosity gap) |
| Story Structure | Object (plaque) → Origin → Unglamorous entry → Operational climb → Crisis year → Plaque callback → Hardest call → Transformation → Philanthropy → Values callback → Personal close |
| Psych Triggers | Underdog (entered Microsoft in IR, not on any list) + Contrast (survival plaque vs $3T architect) + Curiosity Gap (what kind of year earns a survival plaque?) |
| Visual Format | Image or text-only |
| Key Visuals | See Visual Hooks below |

**Reader Value:** Learns the personal origin story behind Microsoft's CFO — the sideways career path, the chaos of year one, the Nokia write-off, the subscription bet — told by an operations leader who values the unsexy work behind the biggest transformation in tech.

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Microsoft's legal department gave their new CFO a plaque after her first year.

It congratulated her for surviving.

I needed to know what kind of year earns that. So I went back and read everything.

### HOOK B

Amy Hood started at Microsoft as a senior director in investor relations.

Twelve years later, the market cap was $300 billion. Twelve years after that, $3 trillion.

I kept going back to how that happened.

### HOOK C

Amy Hood once said she "continually took jobs I really wasn't qualified for."

She's been Microsoft's CFO for twelve years. The market cap went from $300 billion to $3 trillion. And she started in investor relations.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Number Hero — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][LOGO]**
Dark bg (#161616). Dominant element: "$3T" in massive type (200px+, IBM Plex Sans 600, white). Below in smaller #0043CE: "Microsoft market cap under one CFO." Microsoft logo bottom-right, monochrome white, 96px. The $3T creates immediate intrigue — who drove this? Image-hook loop: reader sees $3T → reads about the plaque, the chaos year, every bet Amy Hood made → second look at $3T carries the weight of everything she survived to build it. Mobile-first: "$3T" readable at any size.

**Option B: Number Hero — SQUARE 1:1 — [TYPE][LOGO]**
Light bg (#F4F4F4). Dominant: "$300B → $3T" with arrow in #0043CE. Below: "2013–2025." Microsoft logo bottom-right. The gap between the two numbers IS the concept. Clean, no clutter. Image-hook loop: reader sees the scale → reads the story → second look at the numbers hits harder knowing what happened between them.

**Option C: Text-only**
Brittany's voice carries the story. Maximizes feed space for narrative. Best for intimate, story-at-a-table feel.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

Microsoft's legal department gave their new CFO a plaque after her first year.

It congratulated her for surviving.

I needed to know what kind of year earns that. So I went back and read everything.

Amy Hood grew up in Morehead, Kentucky. Her father was a doctor, her mother taught nursing, and church was the center of everything.

She went from Duke to Goldman Sachs to Harvard, then back to Goldman. Eight years on Wall Street before she ever touched tech.

In 2002, she walked into Microsoft as a senior director in investor relations. Nobody headlines an IR role.

From there, Chief of Staff for the server division. Strategy lead for the group that owned Office. Divisional CFO. She was inside the product before she ran finance for the whole company.

In May 2013, they named her CFO. First woman in Microsoft's history.

Within weeks, she flew to Europe to close a $9.5 billion Nokia deal she hadn't championed. The CEO shook up the C-suite. Then he announced he was leaving. For six months, she ran the finances of a nearly $300 billion company with no permanent CEO.

That's the year legal gave her the plaque.

Two years later, she called what nobody else would. Nokia was failing. She wrote off $7.6 billion and cut 7,800 jobs. Then she built the financial model that moved Microsoft to subscriptions when the whole company ran on one-time licenses.

$300 billion became $3 trillion.

But y'all, that's not what made me stop.

While she was building the financial architecture behind that transformation, she also led a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund and a $750 million affordable housing commitment for 16,000 units in Puget Sound.

She grew up in a family where "one did things for a bigger purpose, not always for oneself."

And I love that the woman behind $3 trillion still builds like she means that.

That's who I want to study.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "I needed to know what kind of year earns that" + "So I went back and read everything" (Brittany as curious narrator, earned first person). "But y'all, that's not what made me stop" (signature + personal bridge). "And I love that" (Brittany's enthusiasm signature). "That's who I want to study" (personal verdict). Medium-to-long flowing sentences throughout, no choppy one-liners as default.
- **Storytelling architecture**: Every consecutive sentence connected by Cause→Effect, Setup→Payoff, Contrast, or Escalation. Plaque introduced in hook, answered mid-body ("That's the year legal gave her the plaque"), then story continues past it. Tested with One-Line Test and But/Therefore Rule per `20_storytelling_rules.md`.
- **Open loop**: Hook opens "What kind of year earns a survival plaque from legal?" → Closes at: Nokia deal + CEO departure + six months alone = "That's the year legal gave her the plaque." Then continues: write-off + subscription bet + $3T + philanthropy.
- **Bridge from $3T to philanthropy**: "But y'all, that's not what made me stop." = Brittany re-enters as narrator. Signals: the business transformation was impressive, but something deeper is coming. Opens micro-loop (what DID make her stop?) → answered immediately by Climate Innovation Fund + affordable housing.
- **Closer architecture**: Three-part personal close: (1) "She grew up in a family where..." = callback to origin, the value system. (2) "And I love that the woman behind $3 trillion still builds like she means that" = personal, warm, ties $3T to values. (3) "That's who I want to study." = verdict.
- **Timeline**: Only moves forward: Kentucky childhood → Duke → Goldman → Harvard → Goldman → Microsoft IR (2002) → Chief of Staff → Strategy → Divisional CFO → CFO (May 2013) → Nokia/CEO departure/chaos → plaque (year 1) → Nokia write-off (2015) → subscription bet → $3T → philanthropy → origin callback → closer. No backward jumps.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: Microsoft's CFO. Single question: "What earns a survival plaque from legal?" Context Lean: "Microsoft's legal department gave their new CFO a plaque after her first year." (66 chars) > Scroll Stop: "It congratulated her for surviving." > Snap Back: "I needed to know what kind of year earns that." Fits mobile: yes.
- **AI slop check**: No em dashes. No colon staging. No flip formulas (#21). No symmetry patterns (#113). No banned words. "But y'all" = earned bridge, Brittany's signature. "And I love that" = Brittany's enthusiasm marker.
- **Rhythm variation**: "It congratulated her for surviving." (5 words). "Nobody headlines an IR role." (5 words). "$300 billion became $3 trillion." (5 words). All after longer sentences.
- **Show don't tell**: Survival: the plaque itself is the object that shows it. Unglamorous path: "senior director in investor relations" shows it, no label. Leadership: "she called what nobody else would" shows courage without labeling it.
- **Ego bait**: Full post dedicated to Amy Hood. Publishing: @mention Amy Hood and Microsoft. Checklist: proud of story, would share, team would tag each other.

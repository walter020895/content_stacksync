# Brittany — I work in AI and I've been thinking about the electricity bill

## Angle: The compliance person who believes innovation and environmental accountability can coexist

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "I do wanna talk about the effects of AI on the environment, but it needs to be crafty because I don't want to put down AI." — Brittany's stated 'unwritten post' from the interview |
| Topic | AI's real environmental footprint and why the people who care about both innovation and the planet shouldn't stay quiet |
| Angle | The compliance-minded ops person who asks the due diligence questions others skip — including the environmental one |
| Hook Type | Investigator (surfaces the hidden cost that the mainstream conversation skips over) |
| Story Structure | Establish credibility (I love this technology) → Surface the tension → The specific evidence → The question → The invitation |
| Psych Triggers | Curiosity Gap (there's a real cost being skipped in the conversation) + Tribal Identity (for the people who hold both things true at once) |
| Visual Format | Text-only or Data viz |
| Key Visuals | Optional: stat card — AI data center electricity consumption vs. country comparisons |

### HOOK A (Recommended)

I work at a tech company that builds with AI. I love what we do.

And lately, I've been thinking about the electricity bill.

### HOOK B

I'm not here to debate whether AI is good or bad. I think it's remarkable.

And I think we're allowed to ask what it costs.

### HOOK C

The AI conversation is moving fast.

One part of it keeps getting skipped.

---

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Text-only**
The careful balance Brittany strikes (pro-AI + environmentally curious) is a voice play, not a data play. Text-only keeps the conversation personal and non-alarming.

**Option B: Number Hero stat card**
Dark bg. Large text: "THE ELECTRICITY OF A COUNTRY." Smaller: "That's what AI data centers now consume annually." Stops scrolls with scale, stays neutral. No photo needed.

**Option C: Infographic — "The AI Conversation vs. The Question We Skip"**
Two-column infographic: Left column "What we're talking about" (speed, productivity, models) / Right column "What we're not" (energy use, water cooling, carbon). Simple and non-inflammatory.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

I work at a tech company that builds with AI. I love what we do.

And lately, I've been thinking about the electricity bill.

Not because I'm against the technology. But I also believe we're allowed to hold two thoughts at once, and somewhere in the rush of that conversation, this one keeps getting skipped:

AI data centers now consume more electricity than some entire countries — a figure the IEA reports is growing rapidly alongside AI adoption. The water used to cool that infrastructure comes from communities managing drought at the same time. The carbon footprint is real, even when the product is good.

As someone who handles compliance and cares about the organizations we work with, I keep coming back to a question:

At some point, does this become part of the due diligence conversation?

Not as an indictment of the technology. As an expectation we put on ourselves. What are our vendors doing about this? What are we doing about this? Are we even measuring it?

I don't have all the answers. And I'm not here to tell anyone what their company should do.

We can build toward the future and still ask what it costs.

## AUDIT: GO — 8.2

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| D1 ICP Relevance | 7 |
| D2 Factual Accuracy | 8 |
| D3 Readability | 8 |
| D4 AI Slop | 9 |
| D5 Reading Pleasure | 8 |
| D6 Reader Value | 8 |

**Notes:** D2 slightly reduced — "more electricity than some entire countries" is directionally accurate (IEA data supports this for 2024-2025) but should be cited before publishing. D1 is Reach content. The careful framing ("I love what we do" upfront) is essential to Brittany's voice and her red line about not putting down AI or StackSync's clients. This is Brittany's bravest post and her most unique voice position — nobody else in the StackSync universe will write this.

**Before publishing:** Verify electricity consumption stat with source (IEA, Goldman Sachs 2024 AI energy report, or similar).

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "And I'm not here to tell anyone..." (honest limits), "I believe we're allowed to hold two thoughts at once" (nuanced Brittany), "I don't have all the answers" (authentic epistemic humility)
- **Hook (Kallaway)**: Context Lean: "I work at a tech company that builds with AI. I love what we do." (62 chars) → Scroll Stop: "And lately, I've been thinking about the electricity bill." (57 chars) → Total before see more: 119 chars ✓ — Snap Back comes after see more
- **Word count**: ~220 words
- **AI slop check**: Clean. "Not as an indictment" could trigger slop pattern concern but it's a specific legal-language phrase natural to Brittany's compliance background, not a contrast flip formula.
- **Fact to verify before publishing**: AI data center electricity consumption stat — source with IEA 2024/2025 or Goldman Sachs AI energy report
- **Connector pass**: "But I also believe we're allowed to hold two thoughts at once" (confession/grounding bridge), "As someone who handles compliance..." (credibility bridge)
- **Redundancy sweep**: PASS

# Brittany — I was a military spouse who ended up in tech

## Angle: Refusing the premise that career and full life are a trade-off

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "I want to show that you can be a wife and mother and a successful woman in startup tech." — Brittany stated this directly as a content goal in her interview |
| Topic | Rejecting the false choice between career ambition and a full personal life |
| Angle | The military spouse who built a career that moved with her — and refuses to accept that one had to lose for the other to win |
| Hook Type | Contrarian (challenges the "you can't have both" narrative told to ambitious women) |
| Story Structure | Personal circumstance → The premise I was given → Why I rejected it → Evidence → The invitation |
| Psych Triggers | Vindication (you don't have to choose) + Tribal Identity (for women who are both ambitious and deeply present in their lives) |
| Visual Format | Text-only |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)

I was a military spouse who needed remote work, wherever my husband was stationed.

I ended up in tech.

And I wouldn't trade a single part of it.

### HOOK B

Someone told me once that the women who get the big career usually give up a lot at home.

I've been proving that wrong ever since.

### HOOK C

My husband's career moved us more times than I expected.

Each time, I rebuilt.

Not the life I had. The life I wanted.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Text-only**
This is a personal conviction post rooted in Brittany's specific life. The story IS the content.

**Option B: Portrait card — Brittany's photo + hook text**
If Brittany has a warm personal photo (not corporate), this would create strong stop-scroll. "I was a military spouse who ended up in tech." over her image. Needs: Brittany's photo.

**Option C: Typographic Manifesto card**
Dark bg, large centered text: "YOU CAN HAVE BOTH." in IBM Plex Sans 600. Simple, declarative, highly shareable. No photo needed.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

I was a military spouse who needed remote work, wherever my husband was stationed.

I ended up in tech.

And I wouldn't trade a single part of it.

There's a story that gets told to ambitious women — that the career and the full life are a trade-off. That you pick the title or you pick the presence. That getting serious about your work means getting less serious about everything else.

I've never bought that premise.

My husband's career meant we had to stay adaptable in ways most people don't plan for. New places. New communities. New rhythms, sometimes on short notice. And through all of it, I kept building. Contracts. Compliance frameworks. Teams. A professional identity that moved with me because I built it to.

I'm not saying it's always tidy. Some days the calendar is chaos and every single thing needs attention at the same time. But I've learned something from all those years in hospitality — managing dozens of moving pieces at once without dropping any of them:

You don't choose between being good at your work and showing up for the people you love. You build the systems, the habits, and the intentionality that let you do both.

The women I look up to most never accepted the premise of the choice.

And y'all, I don't plan to either.

## AUDIT: GO — 8.5

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| D1 ICP Relevance | 7 |

| D6 Reader Value | 8 |

**Notes:** "And y'all, I don't plan to either." is a perfect Brittany close — southern, warm, declarative. The military spouse detail is uniquely Brittany and immediately differentiates from generic "women can do it all" content. "I've never bought that premise." is direct without being aggressive. D1 slightly lower because this is pure Reach (Lane 1) content — won't drive tech pipeline, but builds Brittany's audience.

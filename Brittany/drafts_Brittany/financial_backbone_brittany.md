# Brittany — The Financial Backbone

## Angle: The invisible operators thesis made viral — three women who ran the financial backbone of the world's most valuable companies, anchored to recognizable brands, told through Brittany's ops lens

---

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "Let's bring some light into the other departments that doesn't always get the same recognition." + "I like women who drive massive corporate value." |
| Topic | Amy Hood (Microsoft), Ruth Porat (Google/Alphabet), Robin Washington (Salesforce) — the women who held the financial architecture while the CEOs took the stage |
| Angle | Nobody writes about the CFO. Brittany does. Three companies everyone knows, three women almost nobody can name. |
| Hook Type | Pattern Interrupt — anchor on three universally recognized company names, pivot to the invisible women behind them |
| Story Structure | Brand hook → "I went and read everything" → 3 compressed stories (1 killer detail each) → Operators thesis → Personal close |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition Gap (you know Microsoft, you don't know Amy Hood) + Tribal Identity (every ops/finance person feels seen) + Curiosity Gap (hook names companies, not women) |
| Visual Format | 3-card series (one per woman) — PORTRAIT 4:5 each |
| Key Visuals | See Visual Hooks below |

---

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Microsoft. Google. Salesforce.

You know the CEOs.

You probably can't name the women who built the financial backbone.

I went and read everything about them.

### HOOK B

Three of the most valuable companies on earth.
Three women who held the financial architecture together.
Almost nobody writes about any of them.

### HOOK C

Amy Hood. Ruth Porat. Robin Washington.

If you know all three names without looking them up, you study the right people.

### VISUAL FORMAT

**Option A (Recommended): 3-card series — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][LOGO]**
Three attached images, one per woman. Each card: dark bg (#161616). ONE dominant stat in massive type (IBM Plex Sans 600, 200px+, white). Company role + name in smaller #0043CE. Company logo bottom-right, monochrome white, 96px.

- Card 1: "$3T" / "Microsoft / Amy Hood, CFO" / Microsoft logo
- Card 2: "$60B" / "Google / Ruth Porat, first earnings call" / Alphabet logo
- Card 3: "12" + "years" / "Salesforce boardroom / Robin Washington" / Salesforce logo

Image-hook loop: each number stops the scroll (what's this number?) → post reveals the woman behind it → second look at the number carries the weight of everything she built. Three cards = three independent scroll-stops. LinkedIn previews all three in the feed — each one is a separate hook.

**Option B: Single roster card — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][LOGO]**
Dark bg (#161616). Title at top: "THE FINANCIAL BACKBONE" (IBM Plex Mono 400, 36px, #0043CE, letter-spacing 0.14em). Three rows stacked:
```
MICROSOFT    $3T        Amy Hood
GOOGLE       $60B       Ruth Porat
SALESFORCE   12 years   Robin Washington
```
Each row: company in white 600, stat in #0043CE 600, name in white 400. Stacksync logo bottom-right. One card, entire thesis visible in 2 seconds. Image-hook loop: reader scans the companies → reads the numbers → doesn't recognize the names → taps to find out who these women are.

**Option C: Text-only**
The company names in the hook do the scroll-stopping work. No image needed if cards aren't ready.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

Microsoft. Google. Salesforce.

You know the CEOs.

You probably can't name the women who built the financial backbone.

I went and read everything about them.

Amy Hood became Microsoft's first female CFO in 2013. She inherited a $9.5 billion Nokia deal she hadn't championed, wrote off $7.6 billion when it failed, then rebuilt the financial model that moved Microsoft from one-time licenses to subscriptions. The company was worth $300 billion when she started. It's worth $3 trillion now.

Ruth Porat spent 28 years at Morgan Stanley before Google recruited her. Her first earnings call moved the stock $60 billion in a single day. People called her "Ruth Vader" for her financial discipline. Nobody wrote headlines about the person on the other end of that call.

Robin Washington sat in Salesforce's boardroom for twelve years. When Marc Benioff needed a new CFO, he didn't launch a search. He looked at the woman who had been advising him since 2013.

But y'all. Finance people and operations people don't get the stage.

They get the audits, the write-offs, the twelve-year boardroom before anyone calls their name.

These are the women I study.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "I went and read everything about them" (Brittany's signature narrator move, consistent across women leaders campaign). "But y'all." (voice marker, pivot). "These are the women I study." (personal verdict, callback to women_i_study post). No corporate language. Each woman described through one verified operational detail, not resume bullets.
- **Campaign coherence**: This post is the THESIS post of the women leaders campaign — it names the pattern explicitly ("finance people and operations people don't get the stage"). Individual posts (amy_hood, ruth_porat, robin_washington) go deep on each story. This post is the gateway that brings people into the campaign.
- **Why these 3**: Microsoft / Google / Salesforce = universally recognized by Stacksync's ICP (B2B tech companies, all in their daily stack). CFO / President = ops/finance roles. All three women are "invisible" in the sense that the companies are famous and they are not.
- **Viral mechanics**: (1) Company name recognition = scroll-stop. (2) "You probably can't name" = ego trigger for those who CAN name them (they share to prove it). (3) Every ops/finance woman on LinkedIn feels seen and shares it. (4) @mention Amy Hood, Ruth Porat, Robin Washington on publish = their networks see it.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Context Lean: "Microsoft. Google. Salesforce. / You know the CEOs." (40 chars) → Scroll Stop: "You probably can't name the women who built the financial backbone." → Snap Back: "I went and read everything about them." Fits mobile preview: yes. First two lines visible before "See More."
- **Question Chain**:
  - "Microsoft. Google. Salesforce." → [So what?]
  - "You know the CEOs." → [But what about them?]
  - "You probably can't name the women who built the financial backbone." → [Who are they?]
  - "I went and read everything about them." → [OK tell me]
  - Amy Hood paragraph → [And then?] → Ruth Porat → [And then?] → Robin Washington → [So what's the point?]
  - "But y'all. Finance people and operations people don't get the stage." → [What DO they get?]
  - "They get the audits, the write-offs, the twelve-year boardroom before anyone calls their name." → [Specific to each woman: audits + write-offs = Amy; twelve-year boardroom = Robin] → Closes the loop.
  - "These are the women I study." → [No new question. Closer.] ✅
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's the thing." No contrast flip formulas (#21). No colon staging. No filler phrases. "You probably can't name" is borderline #72 but earned by the specific pivot to three real women. "These are the women I study." is a personal statement, not a generic conclusion.
- **Redundancy sweep**: PASS. Three women, three different stories, three different specific details ($3T transformation / $60B earnings call / 12-year boardroom). No fact repeated across sections.
- **Slop guard note**: "Nobody wrote headlines about the person on the other end of that call." — not a #21 flip (it's a cause-effect observation about media attention, not a contrast template). Earned.

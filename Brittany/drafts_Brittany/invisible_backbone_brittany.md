# Brittany — Nobody writes LinkedIn posts about operations

## Angle: Spotlighting the back-office work that holds everything together

---

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "Let's bring some light into the other departments that doesn't always get the same recognition." — Brittany's closing passion from the interview. "Everybody's gonna need this person regardless of what the industry is." |
| Topic | The invisible back-office work (ops/legal/finance/compliance) that enables everything else |
| Angle | The ops person who chose this work because she loves it — and believes visibility is overdue |
| Hook Type | Contrarian (challenges the tech/sales worship that dominates LinkedIn) |
| Story Structure | The gap (recognition mismatch) → Personal context (why she's qualified to say this) → The argument → The dedication |
| Psych Triggers | Tribal Identity (for every ops/legal/finance person who has felt invisible) + Vindication (your work matters more than the spotlight suggests) |
| Visual Format | Text-only OR Typographic card |
| Key Visuals | Optional: "OPERATIONS" typographic hero card |

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Sales closes the deal.
Engineering ships the product.
Operations makes sure neither of those things gets the company sued.

Nobody writes LinkedIn posts about operations.

### HOOK B

The person who saved your company last quarter probably wasn't in the revenue meeting.

She was fixing the vendor contract before it became a liability.

### HOOK C

I've run HR, finance, legal, compliance, and SOC 2 audits at a tech startup.

Not a single line of code in my body.

And y'all, it is some of the most important work in the building.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Typographic Verdict card**
Dark bg (#08080E). IBM Plex Sans 600. Large: "OPERATIONS" centered. Below in smaller weight: "The department keeping your company out of court." Simple, bold, gives ops people something to share proudly.

**Option B: Infographic — "The Org Chart Nobody Posts About"**
Ranked list format. Left column: gets LinkedIn posts (Sales, Engineering, Product). Right column: keeps the company alive (Legal, Finance, Compliance, HR, Ops). Visual makes the gap obvious.

**Option C: Text-only**
The voice is strong enough to carry it. The hook itself is punchy and the story earns the closer.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

Sales closes the deal.
Engineering ships the product.
Operations makes sure neither of those things gets the company sued.

Nobody writes LinkedIn posts about operations.

I've spent most of my career doing the work that keeps everything else running. HR. Finance. Legal. Compliance. Contracts. Visas. The SOC 2 audit nobody wants to own. The vendor agreement that's been sitting in someone's inbox for three weeks.

These departments don't get the spotlight. They're not on stage at the company all-hands. They're not in the revenue meeting getting high-fived.

But y'all? They are why the company is still standing.

I'm not bitter about it. I chose this work because I genuinely love it — the numbers, the structure, the quiet satisfaction of a contract that's airtight. But there's something worth naming here.

The people doing the invisible work deserve to be seen.

Not just recognized in a year-end message. Seen. For the complexity of what they navigate every single day. For the problems they solve before anyone else even knew there was a problem.

If you're in operations, finance, legal, or compliance right now — this one's for you.

You're not behind the scenes.

You are the foundation.

## AUDIT: GO — 8.7

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| D1 ICP Relevance | 8 |
| D2 Factual Accuracy | 10 |
| D3 Readability | 9 |
| D4 AI Slop | 9 |
| D5 Reading Pleasure | 9 |
| D6 Reader Value | 8 |

**Notes:** "y'all" is Brittany's strongest voice marker — earned here. The list of actual work (HR, Finance, Legal, Compliance, Contracts, Visas, SOC 2) is specific friction that earns authority. "I'm not bitter about it" is a perfect honest caveat that prevents the post from reading as a complaint. Closer is strong and shareable. Egobait: every ops/legal/finance person reading this will want to share it.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "y'all", "I'm not bitter about it", "But y'all?", specific work nouns (SOC 2, vendor agreement, visas), warm strong closer
- **Hook (Kallaway)**: Context Lean: "Sales closes the deal. Engineering ships the product. Operations makes sure neither of those things gets the company sued." (~110 chars) → Scroll Stop: "Nobody writes LinkedIn posts about operations." Total: ~156 chars. Slightly over mobile 150 — consider tightening to "Nobody writes about operations." if needed.
- **Word count**: ~215 words
- **AI slop check**: Clean. The structure ("I'm not bitter about it. I chose this...") is honest caveat, not contrast flip slop.
- **Connector pass**: "But y'all? They are why the company is still standing." (confession/pivot), "But there's something worth naming here." (grounding)
- **Redundancy sweep**: PASS — the recognition gap is named once and the close builds it forward, not restate it
- **Egobait check**: ✓ Every ops/legal/finance/compliance person feels seen and proud → high share potential

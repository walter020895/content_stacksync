# Brittany — The Fellowship

## Angle: The full arc of Ruth Porat told through her father's story — a 16-year-old who fled Vienna on Kristallnacht, was mocked for studying, earned a PhD with almost no formal schooling, and worked at Stanford for 26 years — and his daughter's decision to create a fellowship in his name so future physicists would never be denied what he almost was

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "I like women who drive massive corporate value while supporting corporate social responsibility. I care a lot about philanthropy specifically with children, education, poverty/hunger, and the environment." |
| Topic | Ruth Porat's origin story, told through her father's journey |
| Angle | Brittany telling a story she studied — the father who was denied education and the daughter who built a fellowship to make sure it never happened again |
| Hook Type | Magician (the fellowship + "never finished formal school" create pattern interrupt and emotional stun) |
| Story Structure | Fellowship (present) → Father's origin (1922) → Kristallnacht → Military → Correspondence courses → PhD → JFK → Stanford → Daughter's career → Bridge → Fellowship closure → Personal close |
| Psych Triggers | Underdog (father's entire life) + Contrast (soldier mocked for studying → Stanford for 26 years) + Legacy (daughter honors the struggle through education) |
| Visual Format | Image or text-only |
| Key Visuals | See Visual Hooks below |

**Reader Value:** Learns the personal family origin behind Alphabet's President — the father's journey from the Holocaust to Stanford, Ruth's Wall Street and Google career — told by an operations leader who values education and legacy as proof of character.

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Alphabet's President created a $1 million fellowship at Stanford.

She named it after her father. He fled the Nazis at 16.

I needed to know that story. So I went and read everything.

### HOOK B

Ruth Porat's father fled Vienna on Kristallnacht. Lost his family. Used his soldier's pay to take correspondence courses.

His comrades ridiculed him for it. At 33, he was admitted to a master's program. His visa to America was sponsored by JFK.

I've been reading about his daughter all week.

### HOOK C

Google's stock jumped more than $60 billion after one earnings call.

The woman on the other end spent 28 years at Morgan Stanley before she ever said a word about tech.

I went and read everything about her.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Number Hero — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][DATA]**
Dark bg (#161616). Dominant element: "$60B" in massive type (200px+, IBM Plex Sans 600, white). Below in smaller #0043CE: "Google stock jump. One earnings call." The $60B creates immediate intrigue. Image-hook loop: reader sees $60B → reads about Ruth's father, the correspondence courses, the 28 years on Wall Street → second look at $60B carries the weight of everything that led to that moment. Mobile-first: "$60B" readable at any size.

**Option B: Timeline — SQUARE 1:1 — [TYPE][DATA]**
Light bg (#F4F4F4). Two lines stacked vertically: "1938: Fled Vienna at 16" in #161616 and "2015: President of Alphabet" in #0043CE. The time gap IS the concept. Clean, stark. Image-hook loop: reader sees the two dates → reads the bridge between them (father's journey, Ruth's career) → second look at both dates hits harder.

**Option C: Text-only**
The father-daughter arc is emotionally rich enough. Maximizes feed space for the narrative. Best for intimate, personal feel.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

Alphabet's President created a $1 million fellowship at Stanford.

She named it after her father. He fled the Nazis at 16.

I needed to know that story. So I went and read everything.

Dan Porat was born in 1922 in what is now Ukraine. His family moved to Vienna. On November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht, he fled. His parents and two sisters were killed in the Holocaust.

While serving in the British Army, he used his soldier's pay to take correspondence courses. His comrades ridiculed him for it.

At 33, with less than a decade of formal schooling, he was admitted to a master's program at Manchester. He earned an MSc in physics and a PhD in electrical engineering. His visa to the United States was sponsored by a senator named John F. Kennedy.

He worked at Stanford for 26 years. Published 42 scientific papers. Wrote six textbooks translated into five languages.

His daughter Ruth watched all of this.

She spent 28 years at Morgan Stanley, where she structured the deal that kept Amazon alive during the dot-com crash and helped steer the firm through the 2008 financial crisis.

In 2015, Google recruited her with a $70 million package. On her first earnings call, the stock jumped more than $60 billion in a single day. She added more than $350 billion in value and earned the nickname "Ruth Vader" for her financial discipline.

But y'all, that wasn't the part that got me.

Ruth created the Dan Porat Postdoctoral Fellowship at Stanford, so future physicists would never be denied the education he almost was.

A man once mocked for studying, now funding generations of researchers at the same university where he spent his career.

And I love that the woman running one of the most valuable companies in the world chose that as her father's legacy.

That's who I want to learn from.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "I needed to know that story" + "So I went and read everything" (Brittany as curious narrator). "But y'all, that wasn't the part that got me" (signature + personal bridge). "And I love that" (Brittany's enthusiasm signature). "That's who I want to learn from" (personal verdict). Medium-to-long flowing sentences, especially in the father's arc. No choppy one-liners as default.
- **Storytelling architecture**: This post is UNIQUE in the campaign because the story is about Ruth's FATHER, not Ruth herself. The father's arc IS the post. Ruth's career is compressed into two paragraphs because the father's journey explains who she is better than her resume. Every sentence in the father section connects: flight (cause→effect) → Holocaust (escalation) → military (time compression) → correspondence courses (character reveal) → ridiculed (contrast) → admitted at 33 (payoff) → PhD (escalation) → JFK (surprise) → Stanford 26 years (resolution). Ruth's section mirrors the father's ambition at larger scale.
- **Open loop**: Hook opens "Why did Alphabet's President name a $1M fellowship after someone who fled the Nazis?" → Closes at: "so future physicists would never be denied the education he almost was." The father's denied education CAUSED the fellowship.
- **Bridge from Ruth's career to fellowship**: "But y'all, that wasn't the part that got me." = Brittany re-enters as narrator. Signals: the business career was impressive ($60B, Ruth Vader), but the real story is the legacy act. Opens micro-loop (what IS the part?) → answered immediately by the fellowship.
- **Closer architecture**: Three-part close: (1) "A man once mocked for studying, now funding generations of researchers at the same university where he spent his career." = the arc compressed into one sentence (callback to "ridiculed" and "Stanford 26 years"). (2) "And I love that the woman running one of the most valuable companies chose that as her father's legacy." = personal, warm. (3) "That's who I want to learn from." = verdict.
- **Timeline**: Only moves forward: Dan Porat birth (1922) → Vienna → Kristallnacht (1938) → British Army → correspondence courses → Manchester (age 33) → PhD → JFK visa → Stanford (26 years) → Ruth's career (Morgan Stanley 1987-2015) → Google (2015) → fellowship → closer. No backward jumps.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: Alphabet's President. Single question: "Why name a fellowship after a man who fled the Nazis?" Context Lean: "Alphabet's President created a $1 million fellowship at Stanford." (55 chars) > Scroll Stop: "She named it after her father. He fled the Nazis at 16." > Snap Back: "I needed to know that story." Fits mobile: yes.
- **AI slop check**: No em dashes. No colon staging. No flip formulas. No symmetry patterns. No banned words. "But y'all" = earned bridge. "And I love that" = Brittany's enthusiasm marker. "A man once mocked for studying, now funding..." = contrast in one sentence, not a flip.
- **Rhythm variation**: "His comrades ridiculed him for it." (6 words after a longer sentence). "His daughter Ruth watched all of this." (7 words, pivot moment).
- **Show don't tell**: Determination: "used his soldier's pay to take correspondence courses" SHOWS it. Hostility: "His comrades ridiculed him for it." SHOWS it. Intelligence: "42 scientific papers, six textbooks, five languages" SHOWS it. Legacy: the fellowship SHOWS what Ruth values, never labeled.
- **Ego bait**: Full post dedicated to Ruth Porat (and her father). Publishing: @mention Ruth Porat and Alphabet/Google. Checklist: proud of story, would share, immigrant communities feel seen.

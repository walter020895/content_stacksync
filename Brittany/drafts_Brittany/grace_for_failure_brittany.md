# Brittany — What I look for when I'm hiring

## Angle: Defending the right to fail as an act of leadership

## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "We stand up for failure. And I know that sounds so odd, but nobody sees how many times you fail before you succeed." — Brittany's deepest conviction from the interview |
| Topic | What failure resilience looks like in a team and why it's the hiring signal that matters most |
| Angle | Brittany the people-first leader who judges character over output — anchored in the Kevin story |
| Hook Type | Contrarian (challenges the assumption that hiring should filter for perfection) |
| Story Structure | Surprising answer → Why → Evidence (Kevin) → Principle → Reader invitation |
| Psych Triggers | Tribal Identity (for the team member who's failed and wonders if that disqualifies them) + Vindication (resilience > perfection) |
| Visual Format | Text-only |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)

I got asked once what I actually look for when I'm hiring.

My answer surprised them.

I want to know how you've failed.

### HOOK B

The interview question I care about most isn't about your biggest win.

It's about what happened after your worst one.

### HOOK C

Every interview asks what you're proud of.

I care more about what you did when everything went sideways.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Text-only**
Personal conviction post — the intimacy of the Kevin story is the content.

**Option B: Typographic Verdict card**
Dark background. Large text: "How you've FAILED." in IBM Plex Sans 600. Subtext: "That's the interview question that matters." Strong image-hook loop for the contrarian take.

**Option C: Comparison Infographic — "What most interviews ask vs. what I ask"**
Simple two-column. Left: "What's your greatest achievement?" Right: "How have you failed?" Reinforces the contrarian angle visually.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

I got asked once what I actually look for when I'm hiring.

My answer surprised them.

I want to know how you've failed.

Not because I'm looking for someone who makes mistakes. I'm looking for someone who knows what to do when they inevitably do.

A few years back, I worked alongside someone named Kevin. Didn't matter what went sideways on a shift, his response was always the same. Calm. Practical. Let's figure it out and keep moving.

That's the person I want next to me when it's late and something's broken. Not the person who hasn't failed yet. The person who has, came back, and still showed up with their kindness intact.

I think we do a disservice to teams when we treat every mistake like a crisis. Nobody sees how many times you fall before the getting-up moment. They just see the getting up.

And so at StackSync, we try our best to stand up for failure. Make room for the learning. Not punish the attempt.

You know what that creates? A culture where people bring you the small problem early, before it grows into something that can't be fixed quietly.

Grace doesn't cost anything. And it compounds over time.

If you manage people: what's your instinct when someone gets it wrong?

## AUDIT: GO — 8.7

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| D1 ICP Relevance | 8 |
| D2 Factual Accuracy | 10 |
| D3 Readability | 9 |
| D4 AI Slop | 9 |
| D5 Reading Pleasure | 9 |
| D6 Reader Value | 8 |

**Notes:** Kevin story is transcript-confirmed, specific, and earns authority without credentials. "Grace doesn't cost anything. And it compounds over time." is the strongest closer. Ends with Brittany's signature — a reflective inclusive question. No slops. No em dashes.

## NOTES

- **Voice**: People-first reasoning (starts with Kevin, not principle), "And so", "You know what that creates?", reflective question close
- **Hook (Kallaway)**: Context Lean: "I got asked once what I actually look for when I'm hiring." (56 chars) → Scroll Stop: "My answer surprised them." (25 chars) → Snap Back: "I want to know how you've failed." Total before see more: 81 chars ✓
- **Word count**: ~220 words
- **AI slop check**: Clean. "Not because I'm looking for..." is explanation, not contrast flip formula.
- **Connector pass**: "And so at StackSync" (specific bridge to company context), "You know what that creates?" (curiosity pull)
- **Redundancy sweep**: PASS

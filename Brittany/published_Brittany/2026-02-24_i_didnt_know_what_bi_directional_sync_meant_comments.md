## RUBEN

**Option A — Founder validation**
> "Brittany was running our finance, legal, and compliance within months. The 3am thing isn't a story she tells — it's how she actually operates. Still does."

**Option B — Dry specific truth**
> "Most people look at a job description they're 60% qualified for and say no. The ones who say yes and then figure it out are the people you want."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "This is why credentials are a filter, not a predictor."

## NACHO

**Option A — Distilled**
> "Pace and will beat credentials. Every time."

**Option B — GTM angle**
> "The industry you don't know is just a vocabulary problem. Vocabulary is solvable."

**Option C — Blunt validation**
> "The people who set the 3am alarm are the ones still here."

## ALEXIS

**Option A — Technical-to-human**
> "There's something the engineering side gets wrong: we assume the complexity is in the technology. Half the complexity is running the company around the technology. That part — Brittany does it at a level most 'technical' people couldn't."

**Option B — Leadership observation**
> "The best hires I've seen weren't the most qualified. They were the ones who were honest about the gap and immediately set about closing it. That combination is rare, you know?"

**Option C — Slightly provocative**
> "Most people use 'I don't have a technical background' as a reason not to try. Brittany used it as a starting point. Those are two very different mindsets."

## CARTER

**Option A — Relatable**
> "The 3am alarm thing is real. I've done this. The gap between 'you don't know this' and 'you know this' is just hours."

**Option B — Field observation**
> "Every customer call I'm on, the most organized person in the room usually isn't the engineer. This makes complete sense now."

**Option C — Ironic**
> "Imagine googling 'what is bi-directional sync' at 3am and then organizing a 50-person NetSuite event two years later. The range."

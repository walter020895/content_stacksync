## IDEA LEGOS

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | "I like women who drive massive corporate value while supporting corporate social responsibility. I care a lot about philanthropy specifically with children, education, poverty/hunger, and the environment." |
| Topic | Yamini Rangan's origin story and rise to CEO of HubSpot |
| Angle | Brittany telling a story she studied — the walk behind the title, the sacrifices nobody headlines, the philanthropy that proves what she's really about |
| Hook Type | Magician (the 350 sq ft detail + "served ambition" create pattern interrupt and emotional stun) |
| Story Structure | Scene (childhood) → Hostile environment → Immigration shock → Career compressed → Crisis moment → Hardest decision → Philanthropy → Callback to origin |
| Psych Triggers | Underdog (every phase of her life started from a disadvantaged position) + Contrast (the scale gap between 350 sq ft / $150 / "on mute" and $34B CEO creates awe) |
| Visual Format | Image or text-only |
| Key Visuals | See Visual Hooks below |

**Reader Value:** Learns the personal origin story behind HubSpot's CEO — the walk, the crisis, the philanthropy — told by an operations leader who values the human work behind the corporate title.

### HOOK A (Recommended)

HubSpot's CEO took a $1 salary in 2023.

That was the year she let 500 people go. Revenue still grew 25%.

I needed to know who makes a call like that. So I went and read everything I could find.

### HOOK B

HubSpot's CEO grew up in a 350-square-foot apartment in Tamil Nadu.

After first month's rent in Atlanta, she had $150. Her first job was serving food at a football stadium.

I've been reading about her for weeks.

### HOOK C

The founder broke 20 bones in a snowmobile accident. She'd been at the company barely a year.

She ran the whole thing for five months. They made her CEO when he stepped back.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Number Hero — PORTRAIT 4:5 — [TYPE][DATA]**
Dark bg (#161616). Dominant element: "$1" in massive type (200px+, IBM Plex Sans 600, white). Below in smaller accent blue (#0043CE): "HubSpot CEO salary, 2023". The $1 creates immediate intrigue. Image-hook loop: reader sees $1 and wonders why → reads the full story → second look at $1 carries the weight of everything she walked through to earn that seat, then gave up the paycheck anyway. Mobile-first: "$1" readable at any size.

**Option B: Number Hero — SQUARE 1:1 — [TYPE][DATA]**
Light bg (#F4F4F4). Dominant: "350 sq ft" in massive type. Below, smaller: "$34,000,000,000". The gap between the two numbers IS the concept. Image-hook loop: reader sees the gap → reads the bridge → second look at both numbers hits harder. Clean, no clutter.

**Option C: Text-only**
Brittany's voice is strong enough. Maximizes feed space for the narrative. Best if we want it to feel intimate, like being told a story at a table.

### FULL POST (as published)

HubSpot's CEO took a $1 salary in 2023.
That was the year she let 500 people go
(Revenue still grew 25%)
I had to understand why.

So I went and read everything I could find.

Yamini Rangan grew up in a 350-square-foot apartment in Tamil Nadu, and inside that apartment, her mother told her she'd be the first woman engineer to do something extraordinary. So she went into engineering.

In India, women were on mute. Fewer than 8% of her class were women. She graduated first.

At 21, she bought a one-way ticket to Atlanta. Her parents offered to help but she said no. After first month's rent she had $150, a job serving food at a football stadium, and she'd never even seen an American football game in her life.

In American classrooms, participation was graded. So she taught herself to raise her hand.

From there she built a career through SAP, Workday, and Dropbox before landing at HubSpot. (Very admirable)

Barely a year in, co-founder Brian Halligan broke 20 bones in a snowmobile accident. There was no transition plan. Yamini ran the whole company for five months, and when he stepped back, they made her CEO.

Then 2023 hit. And if she was going to let 500 people go, she was going to give up her own paycheck too. $1 salary. No cash bonus. Her entire compensation tied to equity.

But that wasn't even the part that got me.

She still takes her sons to India every few years to visit the orphanage she and her husband sponsor. She tells them: "Give them a sense of what your responsibility is in society."

Every chapter of this woman's story, she could have taken the easier road. She never did.

And I love that the person running a $34 billion company still thinks the most important lesson for her kids is how to give back.

That's who I want to learn from

## NOTES

- **Voice**: "I needed to know" + "So I went and read everything I could find" (Brittany as curious narrator, earned first person). "But y'all, that wasn't even the part that got me" (signature + personal bridge). "And I love that" (Brittany's enthusiasm signature). "That's who I want to learn from" (personal verdict, callbacks to "read everything I could find"). Medium-to-long flowing sentences throughout, no choppy one-liners as default.
- **Storytelling architecture**: Every consecutive sentence connected by Cause→Effect, Setup→Payoff, Contrast, or Escalation. Zero "and then" connections. Tested with One-Line Test and But/Therefore Rule per `20_storytelling_rules.md`.
- **Chronology fix (v5)**: "On mute" moved INTO the India engineering section (where it happened). "Raise her hand" stays in the Atlanta section (where it happened). Timeline now only moves forward: India childhood → India engineering → Atlanta → American school → career → HubSpot → crisis → CEO → 2023 → philanthropy → Brittany's takeaway. No backward jumps.
- **Open loop**: Hook opens "Who takes a $1 salary and WHY?" → Closes at: "And if she was going to let 500 people go, she was going to give up her own paycheck too." The layoffs CAUSED the salary decision.
- **Bridge from $1 to philanthropy**: "But y'all, that wasn't even the part that got me." = Brittany re-enters as narrator. Signals: the business sacrifice was impressive, but something deeper is coming. Opens a micro-loop (what IS the part?) → answered immediately by the orphanage section. No jump.
- **Closer architecture**: Three-part personal close: (1) "Every chapter... she never did." = Brittany's observation/pattern extraction from the whole story. (2) "And I love that..." = personal, warm, ties $34B to philanthropy. (3) "That's who I want to learn from." = verdict, callbacks to "read everything I could find."
- **Sentence relationships mapped**: $1 salary (question) → 500 layoffs (escalation) → revenue 25% (contrast) → "I needed to know" (reaction) → "So I went" (cause→effect) → 350 sq ft apartment (scene-setting) → "So she went into engineering" (cause→effect) → "In India, women were on mute" (general→specific: what engineering was like) → "Fewer than 8%" (escalation) → "She graduated first" (payoff) → one-way ticket (new chapter) → parents offered/she said no (setup→payoff, micro-dialogue) → $150 + stadium (specific detail, irony) → "In American classrooms, participation was graded" (contrast with "on mute" from India section, now the reader remembers it) → "So she taught herself to raise her hand" (cause→effect) → career compression (time compression) → snowmobile accident (reversal) → no plan (escalation) → ran company + made CEO (payoff) → "2023 hit" (implied threat) → "give up her own paycheck too" (LOOP CLOSES) → $1/no bonus/equity (fragments) → "that wasn't even the part that got me" (BRIDGE) → orphanage + quote (character reveal) → "easier road / she never did" (pattern) → "I love that" (personal) → "That's who I want to learn from" (verdict)
- **Idea Legos**: Magician hook ($1 salary = number stun) + Chronological narrative with crisis pivot + personal narrator frame
- **Reader value**: Discovers Yamini Rangan's personal origin story and the walk from Tamil Nadu to HubSpot CEO. Brittany's personal lens adds: the pattern of choosing the harder path, and the philanthropy as proof of character.
- **Psychological triggers**: Underdog (every chapter starts from disadvantage) + Contrast ($150 vs $34B, "on mute" vs CEO) + Curiosity Gap ($1 salary question, answered through layoff-to-salary causal chain)
- **Ego bait**: Full post dedicated to Yamini. Publishing: @mention Yamini Rangan and HubSpot. Checklist: proud of story, would share, team would tag each other, immigrant women in tech feel seen, values reflected accurately.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: HubSpot's CEO. Single question: "Who takes a $1 salary and why?" Context Lean: "HubSpot's CEO took a $1 salary in 2023." (44 chars) > Scroll Stop: "That was the year she let 500 people go." > Snap Back: "Revenue still grew 25%." + "I needed to know who makes a call like that." Fits mobile: yes (44 chars first line).
- **Traffic driver**: HubSpot, CEO, women in leadership, immigration
- **AI slop check v5**: No em dashes. No colon staging. No flip formulas (#21). No symmetry patterns (#113). No banned words. "But y'all" = earned bridge, Brittany's signature. "And I love that" = Brittany's enthusiasm marker (personality doc). Fragments earned, not staccato default.
- **Rhythm variation**: "She graduated first." (3 words). "She said no." (3 words). "Then 2023 hit." (3 words). "$1 salary. No cash bonus." (fragments). "She never did." (3 words). All after longer sentences per Gary Provost.
- **Show don't tell**: Determination: "Her parents offered to help. She said no." Poverty: "$150, a job serving food." Integrity: "give up her own paycheck too." Character: orphanage visits + direct quote. Hostility: "women were on mute. Fewer than 8%." Pattern extracted by Brittany, not labeled.
- **Formatting check**: Phone scroll test PASS. Longest paragraph: 3 sentences. 19 air lines. No text walls.
- **Redundancy sweep**: PASS. "500 people" in hook (context) and body (causal trigger). $34B only in closer. "On mute" in India section; "raise her hand" in American section — no repetition, just contrast separated by chronology.
- **Factual accuracy**: "Her entire compensation tied to equity" = correct per SEC proxy ($25.9M). $34B market cap = public record.

Me: Corazón de mi hombro.  
Them: So let me show you a different approach. StackSync connects Salesforce and Zendesk sees the full account context in Zendesk within A ticket escalates in Zendesk. To create a real The native Zendesk Salesforce connector is one way. Data flows from Salesforce into Zendesk. But ticket data, CSSAT scores, escalation history, none of that flows back. And formula do not trigger syncs at all. Because of a Salesforce streaming API limitation. Zapier handles simple triggers. But it caps at 104,000 records and defaults to overwriting tags on every sync. That is silent data loss. Custom code means writing against two APIs with different rate limits. Salesforce gives you a 100,000 calls per day. Zendesk caps you at 700 requests per minute on a good plan. And you are maintaining that integration for so let me show you a different approach. And you are maintaining that integration for So you at seven requests per minute on a good plan, and you are maintaining that integration

Them: That okay? In instead of the the speaking  
Me: Yeah. It's okay, Brittany. Actually, I already count on that. So but but I want first, I have I cannot write for you if I don't I don't know you well enough. So I can know what you would say or what's your like, your way of of seeing what how how do you see the things that we do? So I have to understand you a little bit more, a little personal. So I can infer something to publish on your name. So, what are we going to do to today? It's like a quick questioning, I want to like know you better  
Them: Ok.  
Me: and then I'm going to record this through granola to have transcript and that would give me some insights, understanding how you how you see things, and that would help me a lot. So, the this call is to understand you, and then I will start, like, to figuring out how your voice, your style, your personality is at the time that I am writing for you.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: This sounds great.  
Me: Alright. Yeah. Perfect. Give me one minute. I'm going to change my location because there is too much noise here. I'm going through an office. So, you know, I have, like, a a few questions but this has to feel feel more like a like knowing each other. So I can... So don't don't pressure, don't overthink your questions. Like, just try to be yourself. And this will help me a lot because this has to feel natural. I need to finish time on doing this with someone of the team. But, yeah, let's go. Here I have my questions. Okay. Just to build a little bit of of report here, want to tell you that I'm really happy to be here. This taxing and work with people like you, because it is amazing. And as you can see, my English is not that good, so I hope it's is your understanding good but I'm proving that. You are good with my English, right? Perfect.  
Them: Of course. Yes. Very excited to work with you as well, and your English is is great.  
Me: Perfect. Perfect. So I I want you to can you please tell me a little bit of background history about you and how did you end up end up at STAXI?  
Them: Of course. So my background, my work background, is actually in hospitality and hotel operations. And this operations I did for about ten years, And I I was really interested in StackSync because it was a different It was still operations, but a different industry. And so I have actually a finance degree from University of Georgia, and I was working as a waitress and a bartender up until, you know, all the way from high school through college. And when I began my degree, they  
Me: Okay.  
Them: saw opportunity to move me up into management, into operations. And then when I my degree, I ended up becoming what's called, like, a controller, director of ops. So doing a lot of the finances and a lot of the daily operations. Got into wine, got into hotel, got so that was a lot of fun. But there was actually a a personal move for for my or a personal reason behind my my transition in industry was I was financial techno and so my husband, we got married, and he's military. So I needed to  
Me: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Brittany. I'm  
Them: that was remote in this felt like a great  
Me: I'm losing you. It's it's my Internet maybe, or it's yours because I've it's it's like I can't hear you well.  
Them: You can't hear me well?  
Me: Could you? Ja, ja, ja. It's like it's a slow My Internet is kind of okay. Could you review yours?  
Them: Can you Yeah. My I have full bars.  
Me: Okay. Okay. Maybe just what the time? I I stopped hearing you well when you say that this was a personal move, to move from industry.  
Them: Oh,  
Me: So could you take on on that?  
Them: of course. Of course. Is it can you still hear me okay now?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I can hear you. Okay. Now  
Them: Okay. Because we can always do this over the phone if you need to.  
Me: think it's better here because I have granola recording.  
Them: Okay. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Yes. So I I was a personal move because my we got married, and he's military. And so I really needed to focus on on a remote position or that allowed me to work remotely and have a certain flexibility in my schedule, but I wasn't ready to give up on operations or finance. And so Abby actually reached out to me and she knew of this personal transition as well as my interest in finance and as well as my experience in operations. And she knew this position was mostly finance and ops. And she also knew of my interest in in shifting from hospitality and hotel to tech.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: So this this was really a wonderful transition. I have no tech background, but I have operations and finance background. And I was excited to learn. So I actually when my first two weeks started as a freelance contract, I would actually wake up several hours earlier than our meeting. It's, like, sometimes three and four in the morning, and I would study the product, and I would study what SaaS was and iPass and what an integration cloud meant. Terminology and and technology that everybody already knew that I was having to play catch up on. And so I really studied company, studied Ruben, before I would even start my workday. And so that's how I got into StackSync was I just really dedicated myself to learning what STACK Sync does, what our industry is, and I knew that operations could be a from one industry to another. It was very easy to be transferable.  
Me: Amazing. Amazing. That's amazing. It sounds funny because staxing is like the place where people like change what they they've been doing, like, try to find a new opportunity. Because, I you don't know that, but I am civil engineering. So it has nothing to do with tech. And Nacho is mechatronic engineering, And I think there is another few examples of this so it's very interesting. It's texting, like, like try to give you give us, like, this another opportunity to to do another thing. Professionally. So that's great. I'm curious. Of what's something about your role that energizes or makes you feel like most alive, like very happy.  
Them: Oh, absolutely. I think I really, really enjoy learning about legal compliance. I know that that sounds kind of odd, but I've been doing so many so many different, so many different tasks regard regarding, like, compliance with SOC two and SOC three and learning all of that tech compliance and regulations is really interesting to me. I really enjoy the visa work. Working with the lawyers and learning different rules and regulations for the EORs into the different countries. And, of course, my degree being in finance, and I am interested in pursuing my master's in finance here, on my own time. So I really enjoy working with the money. And I know that sounds so weird because so many people don't like the numbers. But if I'm honest, I don't like the tech. I like the numbers. I like the legal. I like the contracts. You know, that's that's what excites me. And so so every you know, everybody's gonna need this person regardless of what the industry is. And so it's it's fun. It's fun to learn these different these different  
Me: Me hice  
Them: avenues of the job.  
Me: Me dice,  
Them: And and it's funny that I work for a tech company, but I'm not as interested in the tech as I am. The other but that's great. That's my job. That's my job. So I'm glad I like my job.  
Me: Yeah. Amazing. Amazing. That really is super interesting. Thank you for that. What do you think I mean, like, we all have these kind of days where something don't work. You know? Something like, I need to do this, but I don't know. And and I like to learn too, but something is, like... Some days, I I feel, like, very down. So what what do you rely on when your thinking feels or focuses? When you don't know how to do something? Who do you rely or who you talk?  
Them: Absolutely. So the first thing that I'm oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the the first thing I'm gonna do if I'm really getting frustrated with the task or I'm not understanding something, I'm gonna step away from the computer for ten, fifteen, twenty minutes. I'm going to get some sunshine, and I'm going to leave the problem for ten, twenty minutes. However long it takes very briefly, but just long enough to have fresh eyes. And then after that period of just separation, I enjoy researching, but the people I'm going to lean on is going to be you know, it's gonna be my team. So if it's something in engineering that I don't I'll reach out to somebody in engineering. If it's something in marketing I understand, I'm gonna reach out to If it's something in, you know, sales, I'm gonna reach out to Ruben. You know? I'm not afraid to lean on my team where needed because that's what makes us stronger is whenever we rely on each other's intellect and experience. You know, I I don't know everything, and I'm not gonna pretend to know everything. But I know that there's somebody else that knows better than I do. And if if resources in my team isn't an option, then, you know, good old Google. Honestly, that is a great way to deep dive and really find the answers you're looking for. You know, just good old research. That's a great way to figure something out. Like, for example, when I was doing Sprint Hill compliance, I did not know the first bit about tech compliance. I didn't even know what SOC two meant. And I had to really research, and it took hours of research. And and I did get discouraged at those points in time, but that's when you step away from the computer, you get some air, or you get some sunshine, and you come back with fresh eyes. You make yourself a cup of tea, or a cup of coffee, you know, You don't allow the burnout to consume you. You just just and then you separate and come back when you can.  
Me: Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Okay. So I think that everybody has a personality especially at the work we're trying to make the best we can of this company So how do you if if somebody like is trying to know you, already know you, Somebody already know you. And he's going to say, like, this feels like like would be some some work that Brittany made, you know? Like, what can what differentiate your work when you're doing something? What what kind of details do you look for? What I mean, like, if I see some work from you, how would I know that it's your work?  
Them: Absolutely. Okay. So one of my chill tell signs is, color coding. I love to color code everything. So you're gonna find big bolded headers. You're gonna find color coded with a key in a table. And find very organized files That is how I like to keep my life as super organized, super OCD. Even my spices in my kitchen are labeled and organized appropriately. But that's how you always know that I've definitely done some  
Me: Amazing.  
Them: some of the work is there's gonna be a color coding system. And, of course, many people use that. I'm not I'm not the only one. I didn't invent color coding, but it's funny because whenever I look at spreadsheets, you know, I know if Ruben made it because there's no color coding or bolding, and people know I made it because there's all color coding and bolding.  
Me: Amazing. That's really really yeah. Yeah. It's a good way to to differentiate your work. I like to be organized too. I wish I were more organized Like, color coding, it's not my not not strong in me, but it's okay. Amazing. Talking about your communication style, is there some I mean, like, do you prefer to be a person that is, like, more direct, straight to the point, Do you like to make the point with an example you like to, like, create a storytelling? And this can be very difficult because one thing is what we like to consume, but another thing is how we communicate, how we write. So how will you say that one, what do you like to read? Like, what kind of things I would like to watch and how you communicate is another question. I mean, like, there is a differentiation in in both Can you tell me more about that?  
Them: Of Of course. So I definitely have a strong creative side. I love storytelling. I love finding you know, the lessons learned in a in a in a narrative. I think it's wonderful. Like, I love books, first of all. So if you can learn these different themes and lessons and big ideas and points through through narrative, I love that. But, of course, when it comes to business, whenever we're go go go, I love to have people communicate in a very direct fashion, very efficient and very smooth, to prevent bottlenecks. But for me, if I'm if I'm telling, you know, if I'm trying to get a point across and I have the ample time to give like, a story or a metaphor or a way of relating it and communicating it so other people can have a personal connection. I really enjoy that. I'm not quite as direct as, you know, some other people. But, you know, I think that is also, like, a little bit of my southern flare is is sometimes we say things in in metaphors and in saying You know? Everything has has a double meaning behind it. And not in a bad way, but, like, in a you know, if somebody says watch for deer when they're leaving, that's another way of saying love you. It's it's, I I definitely like to communicate in stories and narratives and metaphors.  
Me: Amazing amazing. What what what's a phrase or question or something that you say that show up in your speech? More than you realize.  
Them: Oh, let me think about that. You have me overanalyzing how I talk. I love it.  
Me: I I know that you are you say always in the stand up, like, which is exciting. I think one might be one one of those. But I don't know if you have another one.  
Them: I definitely well, I don't know about phrases. I definitely say all the time. That is definitely the biggest indicator I'm from the South. It's y'all you all or sometimes sometimes I have a little southern flair in in some of my my grammar. I don't write that way, but sometimes I speak that way. And it's just a southern thing. But I don't know. Maybe my phrases, I I like to start my mornings. You know, good morning, everybody. I hope you've had a wonderful morning.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, stuff like that. I like to I like to always start a conversation at least with a greeting as much as possible. It's great to dive into business, but, you know, at the same time, I think it's great to just be like, hey. How are you? Hope you're having a great morning, and then dive into a conversation I'm not sure if there's a specific phrase that know, shows up in conversation more than the others. That might be a better question for all you guys. I've been talking to you for a while now. You might know that a little bit better than me.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: If I haven't paid attention to Emma.  
Me: Amazing amazing. I really appreciate the energy that you bring to the to the to the stand up, because it's like, when it's time for you to talk, it's like, wow, this is going to be, like, very, very good. You know? It's just, it's okay. So thank you for that. I I I'm I'm curious. Have you ever been, like, that? I mean, like, you you bring this energy in this way, like, always? What... When or it's like more like you doing on purpose you know consciously I want to bring this energy where it's supernatural  
Them: So it's definitely an intentional and conscious effort, but I've always been like this in my workplace. And it it is intentional, and I like to have a good bubbly energy. I have it with my friends. I have it with my family. I would say it it's it's been an intentional a very intentional thing that has become habit. Because I want to show up with positive energy, and I want to show up with enthusiasm because I know that if you it's just like it's anything that you practice. If you practice enthusiasm, if you practice encouragement, it becomes, like, second nature to you. So I've always done that in my work place, especially doing hospitality. Being in hospitality and service it comes second nature after you've done it for ten years, which that's how long I've done it. And it really helps you mitigate, you know, any friction you learn really, really well how to triage you know, customer friction is really good. It tea almost like gentle parenting, but it tea you how to deescalate situations, but also remaining direct and firm in in your stances. But, also, it just brings really good energy and it sets the tone for the rest of the day. And I've I do that in the mirror with myself when I set my own intention for the day, and I like to do it for the team as well. And so to answer your question, it's honestly both. I intentionally do it because I want it to become habit, and so it has  
Me: Amazing.  
Them: become habit.  
Me: Amazing amazing. It's really good, really good. Talking about like the escalating situation like your relationship with with another with another people What's a principle that you always stand up for even when it would be easier not to in, like, those kinds of difficult situations.  
Them: That's a great and there's definitely some foundational ethical principles You know, I've taken on a lot of the the legal compliance, and and that also means for some HR stuff. You know, there's always gonna be ethical principles that I'm I'm always gonna be firm on even if, you know, there's misunderstanding or miscommunication or pushback. And that's just respect. Boundaries, equal rights. You know, this feels very it feels very what's the word? Like, like, it feels oh, like, of course. So, of course. We we do that. But, you know, there humans make mistake and there still are points in time where you have to make sure that you're maintaining respect in the workplace. And and so those are always gonna be principles and foundations that I'm firm on. You know? But maybe something a little less a little less, thought about. You know? Something that maybe people don't always think about is one of the things that I'll I'll be firm on is or that I'm always gonna stand up for is giving people I got I'm trying to think of a a good way to word this.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I like to be intentional in my words too. But I guess giving people grace, you know, we what I love about STACK sync is we make room we allow room for failure because we know that success success happens because failure exists. And so, you know, when you go to these companies and, oh, you have to meet expectation, this expectation. This expectation. Yes. We have high expectations, and we have high goals. That we will achieve. But at the same time, there is room for failure. There's room for learning. And I think that as such a powerful thing. It's a powerful tool here at StackSync because you know, we stand up for for failure. And I know that sounds so odd, but nobody sees how many times you fail before you succeed. And so I'm always gonna advocate for somebody, like, if oh, if they make a mistake, let's have some grace because that's a learning moment, and they're only gonna get better from that point on.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So, you know, of course, very foundational things. Know, HR, human rights, all that great stuff in the workplace, being very ethical. With our product, and being very ethical with our staff and our team. All being very very graceful in in understanding that nobody perfect.  
Me: Amazing amazing did you manage people in your previous works? Okay. What  
Them: Yes. Yes. I did.  
Me: what's quite a behavior for someone on your team that made you feel proud? Mean, like, what what is, like, you say, this is my team. You feel like very good about it.  
Them: One of the things this actually reminds me of one of my team members. His name is Kevin. We worked in Atlanta together. One of the things about Kevin that made me so proud to manage him was that his his ability to be resilient. And what I mean by that is you know, sometimes we don't always have the easiest days at work. Not every day is perfect. Not every day goes as smooth as you want it. But he always had such a positive attitude. And if something wrong happened, he's like, well, it is what it is. Let's manage it. Let's move on. And I loved that. That made me so proud of the resilience. You know? You get knocked down, pick it right back up. Let's keep moving forward. And just doing it was such kindness too. Or if somebody makes a mistake, like, like, people make mistakes all the time. Would always respond to it in such a kind way. And I I really I guess that kind of ties in my previous answer, but that makes me proud when I have a team that focuses on empathy and kindness you know, part of their business ethics.  
Me: Okay. Amazing. Amazing. Let's let's go a little bit deeper on content. I know that this is because we're trying to grow, and you are want to be more present and to expand your network, But besides that, how would you like to people feel to feel like, when you read your content? Like, what would you like them to feel like? Would you like the them to learn? Would you like them to reflect? Would like them to to to think deeper? I mean, like, to be like a philosopher? I mean, like, what is what would you like how would you like to be seen when somebody reads your content?  
Them: Absolutely. I think I think it's really important to me that when people read my content, they see more than just an employee of StackSync. And what I mean by that is a lot of the content and the people that I follow are wives. They are mothers. They are philanthropists. They are artists. They are writers and poets and singers and educators. And you can be so much more than just your job title. And although I know LinkedIn is meant for work, I think it's really important that StackSync also has a sector of the social media profile that shows this is our philanthropy. This is how we this is how we talk about you know, the environment and the effects of AI on the environment. This is our thoughts on no, balancing work and life and how you can make this a lifestyle, how start up start up life is a lifestyle. It's not a nine to five. And I think it's and I know if I'm I'm putting this into the best words I'm trying. But, of course, I want StackSync to be the main point of my profile, but I want people to see that there is more to StackSync than just the product. Does that  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.  
Them: I know if that makes I know I'm communicating that the best. I  
Me: Yeah. Absolutely.  
Them: but, you know, I want people to see yeah. I want people to see Stack Sync supporting you know, charitable and and, like, philanthrop philanthropy, and I want people to see you know, because that's that's one of those things that I'd like to establish. I'd like to establish, like, a department of philanthropy for our taxes. That's one of the things that we is for charitable donations. But I think education is a big one. I need to get with Ruben, and I'll and I'll loop you in on this. But I want us to select a couple of different foundations or charities that we support or that we follow that StackSync specifically donates to every year, and I wanna talk about that. You know? And I wanna talk about the effects of AI and the because we need to be ethical, and we need to be in the loop on stuff like that. And I wanna talk about, you you know, how startup lifestyle exists and how you can be a wife and mother and a successful, you know, woman in in in start up tech. So yes, I want I want StackSync to be the forefront, but I don't know if that makes I I wanna add in a little bit of life to it, life behind the scenes.  
Me: Yeah. Amazing. Amazing amazing that's how we create that variety we are we're not just robots You know? You we have our personal things, and we have to share everything because it's a profile you know that's what the definition of profile is a profile of a person. So that's amazing. I'm going to steal you like a few minutes more sorry But I want to I want to know nice. I want to know, like, what are the don'ts, you know, like, what you just what would you say, like, I mean, I I don't want to talk about is I don't really, I'm not really into doing this, to say something, like which kind even of words you want you want use. I want to understand the the boundaries of writing content for you.  
Them: Alright. Thank you. I appreciate that. Some of the things that I wanna stay away from in in this I'm glad you asked that because it can they can blend heavily together at times. So, of course, the environment and talking about charities and philanthropy, I don't wanna get political. I wanna avoid politics as much as possible because even though I have personal political opinions and views, I don't think my personal political and opinions and views belong in StackSync. And that's one of those HR things that I like to talk about respecting boundaries is I want everybody on our team and all of our clients and all of our partners to feel respected in their political views and in their differences. And I think that creating that boundary where I, you know, I don't I don't want anybody to read my profile. And feel excluded or different if if they have differing views.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Does that make sense? Like, I'm for example, I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. But if I put out there and I'm not afraid of being a Christian or telling people that I'm a Christian. But if I put that on my actual profile, I don't want anybody who is, you know, maybe you know, Buddhist or or Jewish. I don't want them to feel as if I would not respect them or anything like that. Does that make sense? Like, I wanna avoid any type of I I would say, like, more sensitive topics.  
Me: Okay. That's that's good. That's that's really good. Yeah. Make makes totally sense. I I would like to know if because I know you've you've been a leader, So if someone mirrored mirrored your leadership exactly, what sub-the qualities would like like they need to do that What how do you see yourself as a leader? What qualities do you know you have and you maybe have been recognised to having How would you describe you as a leader?  
Them: No. That's it. Great question. Let me give this some some real thought. I definitely consider myself in encouraging. And and they're to offer support I'm not the type of leader that's gonna direct you until you do this, do that, do this. If I wouldn't do it the same, you know, to the same quality, the same caliber, if I wouldn't be in the trenches with you, you know, I'm not gonna ask you to do something that I wouldn't do. And that has been told to me by by team members before that, you know, like, oh, we really appreciate that when it gets really difficult, you're right in there with us. You're right there with us going through, you know, making it happen you know, pushing for this deadline, pushing for this this service, So that's one of those things is I I I think I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves. And that's a really important quality in a leader. And also being able to listen and take constructive criticism. So if you're whenever you're in a leadership position, a lot of people think Drew, You know, you're the person that gives the constructive criticism, and and you do wanna give you know, quick corrections in the moment that are kind, swift, direct, and to the point. But you also have to be able to take the same type of corrections and listen to your staff. And I think that's really, really important. And I do I do think if somebody was mirroring or mirroring my my leadership style, they would be they would they would do the same. And I like to consider myself diplomatic. You know? Not only am I good at at easing and deescalating situations with clients, but also within the own team members. And I do think diplomacy really, really matters. And being able to see from all and create a cohesive or create a unity, like, form a unity within your team that's it just gels really well together, and that comes with compromises. And being able to hear other people out will also finding common ground.  
Me: ¿Me Amazing, amazing. That's great. It's it's it's it's like I I I I know you a little bit, but what it all it all makes sense. Like, it's been very coherent what you are saying and what you do, so it's amazing. I I I have, like, three more questions.  
Them: Ok.  
Me: First, what's what's a topic that you would like, like, to write that you didn't have time, but I a topic exactly that you have an idea and you want to to write about something that you didn't have time to, you didn't know how to, a very puntual idea, like something specific, do you have something?  
Them: Yes. Actually. And and maybe we could talk a little more with Ruben about this this or, honestly, I think you got this. I do wanna talk about the effects of AI on the environment, but what I don't it needs to be crafty because I I don't want to put down AI, and I don't want to to put down StackSync. And so you need there's, a very unique balance here. Where it is a thing that we need to acknowledge for business ethic but we also need to talk about how you know, we don't wanna damage your own product. We don't want to and a lot of our clients use AI, and we use AI. It's it's in the world, all around us. It's never going away. But I do think that is a topic I wanted to talk about. I just don't know how to. Honestly. I don't know how to approach it without it without it I don't want it to be too polarizing, in our industry.  
Me: Okay. Okay. Amazing. Yeah. I think we can we can, like, spot something, like, give the spotlight but don't necessarily add some polarizing comment But we will figure it out. Do you want to talk about that too? I'm I'm That's my job, that's my job. So did you how how how comfortable do you feel like sharing photos from you and the team, like some like like some events and how comfort how comfortable do you feel like sharing photos from you  
Them: Oh, yeah. I love photos. You can share all the photos you want. I'll just how about we just, like, send them to each other and you're like, hey. Can I post this  
Me: Amazing. Amazing.  
Them: But go for it?  
Me: Favorite book? Could you say that you love your book? Which is your favourite book?  
Them: Oh, I love I love this question. My favorite book is it's called a street cat named Bob by James James Bowen, I believe is his last name. It is it's an interesting book because it comes from the perspective of this this guy. He he wrote the book about himself. It's a biography, an autobiography. And it's about this cat, street cat named Bob, and it's this ginger tomcat that essentially, it's a story about his antics and you know, just how strange and human like this cat was. But once again, I love my narratives that get to a bigger point. This man, James, was a recovering heroin addict. And this cat essentially helped through his recovery by being somebody that or by being something that he needed to take care of. This cat depended on him for food. For medicine, for shelter. And so he ended up he would play music on the streets. They call it busking in I believe this is a United Kingdom. And he would be on the streets, you know, trying to get some money, and that's what he would do. He he was a street performer. And he talks about how you know, when he was homeless and a drug addict that people didn't give him the time of day, and people would treat him less than human. But all of a sudden, this cat that had bonded to him and would I mean, without a leash, would walk in the streets, would sit on his shoulder, This cat would not leave him alone. This cat would ride on buses with him. He became a spectacle. He actually became very famous on YouTube. And this cat had chosen him as this person, and because of that, other people saw him again as human because if this cat loved him so much, then obviously, you know, there there was a a type of connection or a kindness or or or a a relationship there. And so it was really interesting to learn It wasn't just about mean, there was funny antics about this cat, but it wasn't just about the cat. It was about how society as a whole you know, can ostracize their own for poverty and for drug addiction that they deem it's your own fold, it's your own fold, and how there's this cycle of of oppression you know, how it's very difficult to get out of this cycle once you're in it because you know, of how differently society will treat you. And it all it took was this one cap for for the doors to be opened to him where he became a famous YouTuber and a famous author. All because of this cat, gained so much attention and he was able to tell his story through a cat. And I I just really loved that. I love that it brought it brought so much attention to to different  
Me: Amazing  
Them: societal issues.  
Me: That's a good story. I I think I I would add I would add that book to my reading list Amazing. I have one last question. Do you have some posts that you recently saw, you recently read, that you say that that could be me talking about this, like, saying this like like, you really feel like that post could be be could be be right for you?  
Them: Yeah. Actually, I I do think there's a few. I'd be happy to send them to you later this evening, just some screenshots of them. And as well as I'm gonna send you some samples of my own writing that I've done in the past.  
Me: Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Brittany, I I I really appreciate your time for doing this. I have a lot of questions, but but I think the principal ones are are already answered. This will help me a lot to create a voice and style, a personality for you. You will you will fit exactly in the stacks in universe that we are trying to create. So thank you so much for your time.  
Them: Yeah. I I just wanna say thank you so much. And I know that I I apologize sincerely for being late to our meeting because I I ended up getting stuck writing these contracts, and I knew that they had they were time sensitive I had to send them out. But I just wanna say thank you again so much, Walter, and please, if you if you wanna ask me more questions, I still have more time today, but I know you're very busy. Please feel free to schedule more time in my I'd I'd love to walk and talk more with you about this. And I'm just very grateful to be a part of the Staxing family, And I'm really excited to see you really create the profile, bring me to life, and and put me out there so everybody else can see you know, how much taxing means to me. And and it it's really exciting to be able to have a platform where I can talk about things that are really important to me because, you know, I I really do care about StackSync itself, but I also would like to bring the light just now that I'm thinking of it. You know, I'd like to bring the light a lot of the operations and maybe the the legal and visa and and financial elements that is part of the business that really get talked about. You know, with with Ruben and Carter and Tony, it's all about selling the product. And it's all about the technology. You know, with Alexia, it's all about the technology. I'd like to bring in a little more of the operations, a little more of, you know, the some of the the back end work that gets lost. I mean, even we could even talk about the marketing, you and I together. Like, let's bring some light into the other departments that that doesn't always get the same recognition.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. That's a good good idea. Good idea. Nice. I I will work on your first post. Let's say, this is how it's going to work. We're going to work together with few posts, like four or five which are going to lead me if I'm doing a good job recognizing your voice, your tone, your personality and eventually I will manage it myself And I am going just to ask you some things, like, some insight that you have. You have, like, three, four lines about something that you would like to share, then I'm going to make the whole structure to look good. But this is how how it's going to work. Few few posts, then I will manage me myself. Of course, you have the absolutely right to to tell me that. I didn't really like this ball, so we should take it down. But I will do my best to capture your voice and make you grow and show everybody, like, the the kind of topics that you wanna talk. So that's that's that's it.  
Them: Well, thank you so much Well, thank you so much again, Walter. I really appreciate you. I know mean, I know you're gonna do incredible. I I see what you do with the other profiles, and and I just can't say thank you enough. I know you have a lot on your plate, and thank you so much for adding this, into your into your workload.  
Me: It's my pleasure, Brittany. So, okay, I will come back to work. Thank you so much for your time.  
Them: Absolutely. You too. Ciao, Walter.  
Me: Ciao ciao.

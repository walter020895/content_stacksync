1. Most successful people I've met aren't that smart. They move fast, they take risk, they work a lot. That's it.

2. The world is run by C students & failed employees. You can't underestimate yourself.

3. Managing what you choose to sell, do and focus on is more important than how hard you work or how smart you are.

Example:

You can, for the next 40 years:

- Climb up the corporate ladder
- Grind for a mission you don't believe in
- Spend 50hrs/wk+ away from your family

All for a 401k and a white picket fence at the end to show for it.

OR

You can learn how to buy a business and:

- Own a cashflowing biz in your community
- Touch your work with your own two hands
- Disconnect your money from your time
- Spend more time on the things that matter
- Become one of the few... an Owner.

Ownership is not for everyone.

But it could be for you.

I don’t blame you if you're nervous to take the first step on your own.

If that’s you, I’m hosting an event that's just what you need to start acting on business-buying…

1. Waking up at 5:45am solves 99.9% of daily issues.

2. Grab your to-do list. Do the thing you want to do least, first.

3. Stop all 60 min meetings, make them 45 minutes. Tighter meetings, more time.

4. No social media, email, or text when you wake up. Write something, read something, or create something before you get sucked in.

5. Do the $1,000/hr Test. Group work in 3 buckets based on return: $10, $100, $1,000. Offload one low ROI task per day.

6. Change one meeting a week to a walking call. Watch how excited the other meeting member becomes.

7. Add a How vs Won't check-in. When you say, ""that WON'T work."" Instead ask, ""How could that work?""

8. Be the dumbest one in your friend group, then move on when you’re not. As they say, if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.

9. Take a picture of your net worth. What gets measured gets managed. Check finances daily.

10. Always the stairs, never the elevator. Pick the hard option. See how much stronger you are than you think.

11. Never write to-dos in stone. You're 10x more productive if you reprioritize daily.

12. Meditate. 10 minutes a day. For a twofer - do it in the sauna. Sometimes hacking culture gets it right.

13. Get intimidated. Everything you want is on the other side of fear. Do something every day that scares you a little bit.

Life is the small things repeated daily.

Change one daily habit, and beautiful things start to happen...

So pick one.

↓↓↓

Also...build the habit of getting ownership, not income.

27 lessons I wish I learned in my 20s: 

1. As soon as you hit your 30s, you’ll understand... Your 20s actually suck. If you feel like it sucks right now, guess what? It’s supposed to. It gets better.

2. Your first job is like the DMV. Awful. Everyone’s mad. Nothing works. But the key is.. You are not supposed to stay there.

3. It is very hard to change the world when you are broke. So don't apologize for chasing money.

4. Meet everyone. Say yes to everything. You narrow the field later.

5. Do it all. Because you’ll die eventually and life will make you slow down. But up until then, eat the world.

6. You are not everyone’s cup of tea, that’s a good thing.

7. The most lucrative things you can do in your 20s: 1) learn how to invest, 2) apprentice in PE, real estate, or venture.

8. If they’re not interesting when you’re sober, don’t drink until they become it.

9. Never buy to impress. Being wealthy > looking wealthy… even when that first big-kid check hits your bank account.

10. The most important question you can ask yourself often: Does this bring joy?

11. Do favors, don’t take them. There’s often a hidden price.

12. If I was in my 20s, I’d try to work for one type of company… One where they reward outcomes not hours. Winning > running really hard for a really long time.

13. Seed is only as good as its soil. Where you live during your 20s matters. Take some time away from your hometown.

14. If you feel cynical about the world… I don’t blame you. But always remember the number one superpower for your generation is HOPE.

15. If you’re prone to loneliness and isolation.. do NOT work a remote job. A small team with sleepless nights and shared goals is a powerful thing.

16. Touch grass. A walk outside will be better for your brain than anything you find on your phone.

17. Burnout doesn’t come from working too hard. Burnout comes from working too hard, on things that don’t light you up.

18. Learn how to save now, but understand that saving isn’t what makes you rich.

19. If you want to make more money, be more useful to people who have more money.

20. You must learn to be disliked or you will find yourself stuck in a prison of other people's beliefs.

21. Most successful people I've met aren't that smart. They move fast, they take risk, they work a lot. That's it.

22. If old you doesn’t make you cringe, you haven’t grown enough.

23. Do something hard every day. Then watch that “something” evolve as you become stronger and stronger.

24. If you haven’t done it, you just have an opinion.

25. Marrying well is the biggest life hack of all. Marrying poorly is a costly path to misery. Choose wisely.

26. Working smarter not harder is a beautiful lie. You will not know how to work smart until you've worked very hard for an irrationally long time.

27. Take notes from old people… Waking up early, being married, reading books, going to bed at 10pm, and drinking less is actually amazing.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_im-39-27-lessons-i-wish-i-learned-in-my-activity-7418653473593798656-l57J?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAF0xL_oByCbKvMWnw2gqp5d9JJD_HZczzDg

It's always who not how.

1. There's only so much time in the day.
2. There's always going to be someone smarter and better than you.

These aren't problems. They're levers.

Every time you struggle with an issue, don't try to figure out how to solve it. Instead, ask yourself what type of person could solve it for you.

You don’t have a HOW problem, you have a WHO problem.

Solve that and you solve everything.

He was 10x better than me at managing up.

It took 10+ years for me to click that most companies reward politics, not performance.

So I left. Started buying boring businesses and building my own thing.

Now I make many times what my old bosses did. No corporate games.

The best operators don’t usually climb the ladder. They are the ladder everyone else climbs.

Corporate optimizes for compliance. Owners optimize for competence.

- I used to think it was a win to never answer my phone, always be focused on work. Now I realize those who show up for others are the only ones who win in the long term.
- Never trade your reputation for money. Money you can make more, reputation you can't.
- Your positioning is your most important asset. Product can be copied... But brand and reputation cannot.
- “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.” True reminder.

The Law of Two Hours: 2 hours of dedicated work is worth more than most people’s 8 hour,"21 tips to be the first gen wealth builder in your family:

1. The Law of Two Hours: 2 hours of dedicated work is worth more than most people’s 8 hours.

2. How to never fail with a business: Start as a side project. Keep your job. Use your salary to fund. Quit when you have enough cashflow.

3. It's not about time. It's about the F word. Focus. You don’t need 24 hours a day to build a business.

4. Think about your salary like a Silicon Valley investor. Treat every single dollar you give to your side business like an investor would.

5. Hope is not a strategy. “Pray like it’s up to God, but work like it’s up to me.”

6. You don't need more time, you need a deadline.

7. Decrease the time between having an idea and getting it done. Money loves speed. Poverty loves waiting.

8. Small & consistent beats big & sporadic. Long hours at a desk is counterproductive.

9. If you want to make more money, be more useful to people who have more money.

10. It is very hard to change the world when you are broke. So don't apologize for chasing money.

11. Nobody cares about your life...They think about you for one second and then think about themselves again. So you might as well do what you want.

12. You must be just dumb enough to believe in yourself, just smart enough to execute.

13. If you say you will do a thing, then actually do the thing. 90% do not do this.

14. No one is coming to save you. You want a better life, go build it.

15. You must learn to be disliked or you’ll find yourself stuck in a prison of other people's desires.

16. Tasting freedom can make you unemployable. Get that initial momentum, and watch your life start to change.

17. You are paid exactly as much as the problems you solve are worth. Bigger problems = bigger $$$

18. Parkinson’s Law: Work expands to fill the available time. Just because you quit your job doesn't mean you'll magically have all of these hours.

19. If you're not currently doing whatever that thing is inside of you, you're not going to do it after you quit your job.

20. Startups are for masochists. If you want that life, I commend you. If you want a slightly less rocky path to ownership, buy a business instead of starting one.

And lastly, there are 2 types of people:

Those who build wealth through ownership. and those who work to make others wealthy.

The dividing line isn’t talent or luck. It’s action.

If you’re a business owner, it may hit you as deeply as it hit me...

He said, you know you’ve met another builder or doer when they’ve felt that flinch at the second Friday of the month.

My father has never bounced a check.

But he remembers this…

It was payday, his business was owed money, and they couldn’t bridge the gap between the two in time.

He could just picture the guys’ faces.

Those last two workers, who had done more than anyone else, stayed later than anyone else…

And they were about to be punished for that by not getting paid.

So he called up his banker, told him he needed a line of credit, and pulled out $100,000 give or take to make sure that every single one of their checks cleared.

At the time, my dad had a business partner who was a different type of guy.

He was the sort to make excuses, pay himself first, and not particularly care if everyone else’s checks cleared as long as he got his.

That partner has since had many businesses fail - and many more employees go without a paycheck.

And my dad has never in all these years had a business fail, or lost anyone a dime.

He often attributes his business success to the fact that he would never let his hardest working guys go hungry...

People will always be your biggest struggle and your greatest gift in business. Treat ‘em right.

28,Codie A. Sanchez,1.2,1794,365,2234,Teacher,AI / Tech,Thought Leadership,Hook -> List -> Insight,There’s no such thing as the right or wrong business.,There’s no such thing as the right or wrong business.  There’s only the business that’s right or wrong for you.  One of the most common DMs I get is: ,"There’s no such thing as the right or wrong business.

There’s only the business that’s right or wrong for you.

One of the most common DMs I get is:

""Should I buy a laundromat, car wash, or storage units?""

But that's totally the wrong question to begin with...because everyone has different goals.

That’s why I created the Contrarian Deal Clarity Framework to help first time owners buy a biz.

You need to define 5 components:

1. Your Ideal Owner Experience

Saying “I want to leave my 9-5” is too wishy-washy.

To trade in your W2 form, your vision board needs to be specific on three things:

- Personal goals (do you want more family time or grind for yourself)
- Income goals (replace your $75k salary or build an empire)
- Business goals (be a hands-on operator or absentee owner)

2. Your Zone of Genius

Think of this as the intersection between:

- Passion (what you love)
- Skills & Experience (what you’re good at)
- Network (who you know)

Most people ignore this and buy businesses they eventually hate running.

Don’t be most people.

3. Business Size

It’s easy to fantasize about buying a Fortune 500 company.

But we’re not playing the billionaire game here.

As a first-time time buyer, look for micro acquisitions:

- <$1M cost
- $50K-$200K profits
- 1-3X multiples

Less competition, more opportunity, fewer headaches.

4. Profit

Remember...you’re not just buying a business for the sake of it.

Your acquisition MUST be an income stream that can cover:

1. Debt service
2. Operator salary (if relevant)
3. Growth/working capital
4. Your earnings

Use these two tests to evaluate if a deal is worth looking at:

The SOWS Test

Before I buy anything, I ask if the business is:

- Stale - Does the owner still use fax machines
- Old - Is it 5+ years old with repeat customers
- Weak - Does competition suck at marketing
- Simple - Can an 8-year-old could understand it

The more boxes it checks, the better.

The BRIT Test

Then I check to see if it’s BRIT:

- Buy - Must be a cashflow, not cash-suck businesses
- Resist - Recession-proof
- Increase - Can I raise prices (most owners undercharge by 30%)
- Tech - Can I add simple technology to improve it?

5. Industry

There are certain industries you should avoid for your first biz.

Think restaurants or hotels...

On the flip side, these are my favorite businesses for first-time buyers:

- Digital Businesses (build once, sell forever)
- Home Services (roof repair / lawn care)
- Professional Services (e.g CPAs)
- Real Estate Enhanced (laundromats/car washes)

Once you get clear on your Deal Box, you stop wasting time on deals that don’t fit your criteria and get closer to buying the biz that FEELs right.

Want to go even deeper than this post did?...

Next week, I'm running a Masterclass breaking down exactly how to buy the perfect business for YOU.

It's not the money we want. It's the freedom.

↓ ↓ ↓

You’re either the hammer or the nail.

Hammers make things happen. They drive the point home. They aren’t afraid to swing hard, take calculated risks, and make an impact. They don’t wait for things to happen; they make things happen.

Nails? They get pounded. They hold things in place, but only because *someone else* decided that’s where they should be.

Nails wait for instructions. They stay put, keep their heads down, and hope they don’t get bent out of shape. Nails might hold things together, but hammers built the house.

No one remembers the nails — they remember who hammered them in.

It can be easy to look at the work of a hammer and think, “Must be nice.” But don’t be mistaken, the toll on a hammer is rough.

What you don’t see are the years of blunt force trauma on the hammer’s head, face, neck, cheek, throat, eye, and claw (all real parts of a hammer). Years of being thrown around. Years of missing the mark and smashing a finger.

Are you starting to get it now?

Hammers are owners.

Nails? The owned.

It found what's called The Spillover Effect:

Kellogg Insight did a study across 58,000 hours in 11 companies.

There were two main findings.

1) Positive Spillover

If you sit within 25ft of a HIGH performer, your performance increases by 15%.

You are no smarter, you work no harder... and you're 15% better.

These highest performers are not impacted by the low performance of their neighbors.

My takeaway = the strong lift up the weak.

But there was a second finding too, a much more concerning one...

2) Negative Spillover

If you sit near a LOW performer… Things get bad fast.

How they define “low performer” in the study is important:

These are “toxic workers.”

A “toxic” person = someone who ends up being fired for their behavior/performance.

On average:

- A toxic worker costs a company $12,800
- 2% of all workers are toxic
- They infect FAST.

And actually – the poison of a toxic worker spans way beyond 25ft:

Researchers said, “You can see their negative imprint and negative effect across an entire floor.”

So remember:

Success is contagious.

But so is toxicity.

Trillions of dollars are about to fall into the hands of those,"What they dream of: Starting the next Apple

What I dream of: Owning a painting biz...

Trillions of dollars are about to fall into the hands of those who are paying attention.

Let's talk numbers:

• 33.3 million small businesses in the US.
• That's 99.9% of all businesses.

What does this mean?

A sea of opportunity. 

Over 80% of these businesses have no employees. Just solo owners, doing their thing.

But of the other 20% (aka 6.6 million)... Many are ready to sell.

Problem is, most people are still daydreaming about sexy startups and AI breakthroughs.

They’re not daydreaming about plumbing companies. Laundromats. Self-storage units.

Because they’re not sexy.

In fact, they kind of smell like hard work. They smell like Main Street.

But the thing about these businesses is:

They quietly cashflow.

So.. why don’t you just start one?

A few reasons why starting sucks:
• Cashflow takes time
• You start with 0 employees (aka, you do all the work)
• You start with 0 customers (aka, even more work)
• You have to find a profitable biz model.

But there’s another option…

BUYING a business (done right) means:
• Instant cash flow.
• Existing customers.
• Proven business model.

You're not reinventing the wheel. You're taking something that works and making it work better.

It's a path to financial freedom that most people overlook.

The opportunity of a lifetime is hiding in plain sight.

So here's my challenge to you:

Stop dreaming about the next big startup.
Start looking at the businesses in your backyard.

Then go big and DO the damn thing.

Buying & running a biz is NOT easy. 

One of the reasons why I'm hosting a (free) Masterclass next week on biz buying. I'll break down the 10-step process I've used to buy dozens of cashflowing businesses.

35,Codie A. Sanchez,1.1,1742,313,2142,Magician,Philanthropy / Cause,Pattern Interrupt,Hook -> List -> Insight,Wall Street has one rule:,"Wall Street has one rule:  Never start what you can buy.  Here’s everything you need to know about buying a biz in 2025:   While 90% of startups fail,","Wall Street has one rule:

Never start what you can buy.

Here’s everything you need to know about buying a biz in 2025: 

While 90% of startups fail, 80% of acquisitions survive the first year.

88% of people worth $30M+ have done at lease one acquisition.

That means the best way to get rich isn’t to start a business like they love to tell us.

The best way to wealth with the highest degree of certainty is through acquisitions.

Right now, the average small business owner in the US is 67 years old. When you’ve run a business for 10+ years, you're bound to be exhausted.

These owners are motivated to sell by what I call the 7 D's:

• Departure
• Divorce
• Disease
• Disagreement
• Distress
• Death
• Dullness

They’re desperate to exit the game but don't know how. 

Most people think they need millions in capital to buy a businesses.

But they don't realize 60% of all business sales involve seller financing.

Instead of going to a bank for a loan, the seller becomes your bank.

You put some money down, and they get paid over time from the business profits.

There are 3 reasons why a seller would agree to this:

1. Cash

Let’s say the bank offered the seller $750,000 for their biz but you offered the seller $1.15 million paid over time.

They’ll make an extra $400,000 by being the bank.

2. Taxes

Lump sum payments hit the seller with massive tax bills.

Installment payments spread over 10 years means lower tax brackets and potentially hundreds of thousands saved.

3. Speed

Bank loans take 3-9 months to close. Seller financing can close in 2-3 weeks.

Now which businesses to target? 

Ones under $10 million in revenue with at least 15% profit margins.

Blue-collar service businesses fit this bill - HVAC, landscaping, cleaning services.

They're cash-flowing, recession-resistant, and boring enough that private equity ignores them. 

BUT, before searching anywhere, create what I call a deal box. Define exactly:

• How much cash flow you need annually
• Maximum purchase price
• Geographic preferences
• Industry focus
• Must-haves and can't-stands

If you don’t know what you’re looking for, you’ll never find it.

Next up, how to find businesses to buy? 

1. Venmo Challenge

Pull your payment history and filter out friends and big companies. What's left are small businesses you already pay - cleaning services, handymen, landscapers.

2. Personal P&L Review.

Open your credit card statements and look at small businesses you spend with. These are owners you can reach out to.

3. The 9-5 Strategy:

One of our community members bought her coworker's $1.5M business with full seller financing after he decided to retire to go skiing with his wife.

Unicorns vs Donkeys

Unicorns = A players, high performers, self starters... aka, the person you WANT to hire for every role at your company.

Donkeys = B and C players, lacking initiative, unmotivated, task-oriented.

The truth every business owner knows but hates to face:

Donkeys are common.

Unicorns are rare.

Unfortunately, MOST people are donkeys. And as a smaller-level business, it's very hard to build the profit needed to attract unicorns.

So you're left with 2 options. You can either:

1. Build a business that can actively search for unicorns.

2. Build processes so good that donkeys can win the race.

Many problems in your business are a WHO problem. But you'd be surprised that solving the HOW often enables the people you have now to succeed.

Processes are your secret weapon.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_this-is-the-hiring-framework-most-small-business-activity-7417203896517005348-84yo?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAF0xL_oByCbKvMWnw2gqp5d9JJD_HZczzDg

We should seize college endowments, use them to pay down student loans, and eliminate government education subsidies altogether.

Maybe then schools would have to get back to the business of teaching instead of acting like investment firms.

Something very eerie about watching endowments post wall-to-wall green returns while youth unemployment hits record highs, household debt skyrockets, and homeownership plummets.

I’m in my 30s now, and I wish someone would’ve told me that your 20s actually suck.

Everybody TELLS you this is the best time in your life, but when you’re in it, it feels the opposite of that.

You are hotter than you’ll ever be, and you have more energy, BUT:

- You’re kind of broke.
- You can’t figure out what you want to “do” with your life
- You feel lost, you work nonstop, you have a miserable job
- You’re single, dating, with crazy emotions
- You go out drinking more than you should

But here’s the thing:

Everybody’s been there. It’s totally normal. And honestly, at the end of the day, your 30s are AWESOME.

Coming into your mid 30s is a blast:

- You have money finally
- You kinda have an idea of what you wanna do with your life
- You’re not so emotionally volatile
- People are slightly more mature, you don’t have to date idiot 20-year-olds

And there are only 5 reasons rich people buy:

Every single reason falls into this hierarchy we call the The Rich Desire Pyramid.

The 5 Levels of Rich Desire:

1. Status – “Make me look important.”

How to sell it: Position your business as the best, not the cheapest. Showcase expertise, exclusivity, and premium service.

Think Hermes: Limited-run purses that are mostly handmade by one person each, from start to finish.

2. Convenience – “Make my life easier.”

How to sell it: Eliminate friction. Offer white-glove service, subscriptions, and concierge treatment. Private jets. Fast. Expensive.

3. Exclusivity – “Let me in, keep others out.”

How to sell it: Restrict access. Membership models, invite-only services, and VIP tiers create demand. Tiger 21 — $20M and they validate your income.

4. Privacy – “Give me space.”

How to sell it: Offer high-trust, high-security services. NDA policies, direct access to owners, and absolute discretion build loyalty. Scrub my name off the internet services.

5. Scarcity – “Make it hard to get.”

How to sell it: Limit availability. Waiting lists, premium tiers, and applications drive demand. Think waiting for the brand new shoe drops. Or Birkin bags.

They're buying into a feeling, a position, a lifestyle. They aren’t price-sensitive, they’re value-sensitive.

I hope something here spoke to you.

They want ownership.

Here’s why some MBA graduates are choosing acquisitions over startups: 

In the 70s, 80s, 90s, MBA grads bought fancy suits and gloated about their big corner offices.

Now, they’re being taught to acquire companies.

We’re living in a GOLDEN ERA for business buying...

Baby Boomers hit ‘peak 65’ last year and it was the largest surge of in our beautiful nation's history. 

An average of 4.1 million Americans will retire EVERY year until 2027. 

And many own businesses they don’t know what to do with…

It’s up to us to continue their legacy and keep their businesses alive. 

Use my 3-6-12 framework to go a-z in buying your first biz... 

The TL;DR is this: 

• 3 months minimum to learn dealmaking
• 6 months to source and secure your deal
• 12 months post-purchase to master the business

Now, let’s break each step down: 

Your first 3 months should be pure learning.

There’s no such thing as a perfect business. Only a perfect business for YOU.

Figure out exactly what that business looks like before you start searching for it.

Terms, financials, tactics, structuring.

Acquisitions is a language. You need to get fluent.

The next 6 months are about finding YOUR deal:

• You'll look at 50+ businesses
• Submit 10-25 offers
• Perform due diligence on 3-5
• Close on 1

The numbers game isn't sexy. But it works.

Once you buy, give yourself 12 full months to master the business.

Why?

• Month 1-3: Learning systems
• Month 4-6: Stabilizing operations
• Month 7-9: Building team trust
• Month 10-12: Growing strategically

Rush this timeline and you'll destroy what you just bought.

I can’t stress this last point enough — you need to be patient. 

As the wonderful Warren Buffett once said: 

""You can't produce a baby in 1 month by getting nine women pregnant.""

You CAN have the business you want. But it comes on its own timeline, not yours.

And that’s it!

Remember, before buying ANYTHING, ask yourself:

1. What kind of business would I actually ENJOY running?

2. What skills do I bring that would ADD VALUE?

3. Can I handle the pressure of other people's livelihoods depending on me?

Then, execute on the 3-6-12 framework.

If you've read this far... I've got something for you. 

I'm sure there are a bunch of questions running through your mind like: 

• How do I buy a business?
• Which is the right one to buy?
• Would I be capable of running it?
• How do I know if this would be the right path for me?

Give me 90 minutes and I'll answer you.

I'm hosting a live Masterclass next week on all of this. Completely free.

But it is a science.

After working with 100s of companies, I can tell you the difference between the ones that plateau and the ones that explode comes down to these 3 levers:

Every scalable business needs:

- The right people (who)
- The right systems (how)
- The right focus (what)

Miss any one, and you'll hit a ceiling.Let's break down each piece (and I'll share what most get wrong):

1. Let's start with PEOPLE

Most owners hire too fast, fire too slow, and expect a miracle in between.

A bad executive hire will cost you $200-300K+ and waste 6-12mos of momentum.

But get it right? You start to own your business instead of being owned by it.

To make sure we only hire A-players, every hire goes through this matrix:

• Known Candidate: Team vouches for them
• Proven Experience: Done exact job before
• Proven Industry: Worked in your sector
• Proven Problem Set: Solved your problem
• Proven Scale: Built at your size

2. Next up: SYSTEMS

5 systems all successful companies have:

• Executive Vision (where you're going)
• KPIs/Goals (what success looks like)
• Performance Dashboards (tracking what matters)
• Communication (keeping us aligned)
• Strong Culture (making it all work together)

Most businesses build these 5 system chains separately.

But we noticed that connecting them through a framework makes scaling more predictable...

This reduces the inevitable bottlenecks that re-appear as you grow:

• Executive planning feeds into →
• Sales metrics which optimize →
• Operations processes which enable →
• Team communication which improves →
• Financial performance

This doesn’t eliminate all growing pains.. but it brings a method to the madness of building.

3. The final lever: FOCUS.

Most owners try to solve 27 problems at once.

The best solve ONE problem exceptionally well – and they pick the RIGHT problem.

Something I constantly hear is: ""My prospects can't afford my product.""But it's rarely a pricing problem. It's almost always a persona problem…

When prospects ""can't afford"" your product, run these 3 tests:

• Competitive analysis: How does your pricing compare?
• Marketing analysis: Is your value prop clear?
• Avatar analysis: Are you targeting the right people?

99% of the time, your problem is an avatar mismatch.

You're trying to sell snow to Eskimos, instead of hot chocolate to skiers.

The most valuable exercise for any owner is building a detailed customer avatar.

Define who NEEDS your solution, not who you wish would buy it.

I've just scratched the surface of these frameworks today...and implementing them properly is where most owners struggle.

The holy grail of business.  It's predictable, stable inco","The 6 secrets to increasing your biz's value all start with one term: 

Recurring revenue.

The holy grail of business.

It's predictable, stable income that comes in month after month, year after year. Plus, there are a ton of other benefits:

• Higher Customer Lifetime Values (CLVs)
• for lower acquisition costs
• More predictable cashflow
• which makes budgeting & planning easier

Potential buyers LOVE recurring revenue. It makes it 10x easier to hire an operator, secure funding, and scale.

As an owner, your end goal is likely an acquisition... And recurring revenue increases your chances.

There are 6 types of recurring revenue:

(Ideally, your biz has at least 3 of these)

1. Long-term contracts

These are agreements of over a year that lock in guaranteed revenue. The longer the contract term, the more valuable it makes a business.

2. Auto-renewal subscriptions

This is the ""set it and forget it"" model. Customers sign up once, and their card is charged every month, quarter, or year.

3. Sunk money subscriptions

This is also known as the 'razor and blades' business model: You buy a base product (a razor), then have to continually buy refills (blades). Since the real money's in the refill, the base product is often sold cheap.

4. Pay-as-you-go

Customers only pay for what they use, but are still subscribed long-term as there’s friction in moving to another platform.

5. Loyalty programs

Giving your customers points & perks makes a customer feel they're ""losing out"" on potential savings if they go elsewhere. No one does this better than airlines.

6. Simple consumables

These are one-off items that are repurchased out of sheer habit & loyalty. Think, regulars at coffee shops, your favorite brand of toothpaste, transportation you have to take every day.

Recurring revenue is a HUGE key to retirement as a business owner.

With so many different types, the options are limited only to your creativity.

↓ ↓ ↓

Best way to track & forecast recurring & non recurring revenue? 

A cashflow tracker. 

Because the only real business advice you really need is...don't run out of cash.

The “Hate Us ‘Cuz They Ain’t Us” Curve:

When you first start out, they tell you...

You’re lame.
You’re crazy.
That’ll never work.
Oh, she’s a one-hit wonder.
She probably has a rich dad.
Or slept her way there.

THEN, we hit the top of the curve. Your success is obvious. And things start to change... They say…

Oh yeah, I know her.
Hey, long time no talk!
Love to meet up and pick your brain.
How did you do that?

And the grand finale...
They ask you for a job.

If success is your goal, expect people to talk a lot of crap for a long time. Let them. Because one day, you’ll just get to point at the scoreboard.

Sanchez,0.9,1393,288,1730,Magician,Entrepreneurship,Pattern Interrupt,Hook -> List -> Insight,The richest people in the world don't just build companies...they buy them.,The richest people in the world don't just build companies...they buy them.  Here’s how you can too (without their millions):   Three reasons why buyi,"The richest people in the world don't just build companies...they buy them.

Here’s how you can too (without their millions): 

Three reasons why buying beats building a business from scratch:

- 45% of new businesses fail within 5 years
- Most entrepreneurs make only $67k/year
- First 3-4 years are unprofitable

Compare that to when you buy...

You inherit customers, systems, and profits from day one.

""But Codie, I genuinely can’t afford one.""

That’s what I thought too when I started. 

There are 3 ways to buy any business (without needing millions):

1. Experience
2. Sweat equity
3. Money

You only need ONE of these three to pull off a deal.

1. Experience

This is perfect for people who know the industry inside and out.

Maybe you've been a plumber for 20 years and want to buy a plumbing company.

Sellers value genuine knowledge over $$ because they know you won't destroy what they built.

2. Sweat Equity

If you’re thinking about working in the business and growing it, this is for you.

Many retiring owners care more about their legacy than maximizing the sale price.

They want someone who'll take care of their employees and customers, not just squeeze the biz for cash.

3. Money

This doesn't have to mean YOUR money.

I've bought plenty of businesses with 0-15% down using other people's money. You can:

- Use SBA loans (government-backed with low rates)
- Get investors to fund the deal
- Or structure seller financing

Seller financing often works as a win-win too. 

Banks tend to lowball business valuations and charge high interest rates.

But when sellers finance you directly, they get a premium price AND earn interest on the loan.

They make MORE money by cutting out the bank.

Just make sure you show what’s in it for them:

- Higher purchase price (ex. 15%+ premium)
- Tax advantages (spread over time vs lump sum)
- Faster close (30 days vs 120 days)

A win-win.

So what businesses should you target?

A few strategies I use: 

1. SOWS method:

- Stale: Revenue hasn't grown in 3+ years
- Old: Been around 5+ years
- Weak: Competitors are terrible
- Simple: You can explain it to an 8-year-old

2. The Venmo Method

Look at your personal P&L:

- Who do you pay every month?
- Who are your competitors?
- What vendors do you use?

These are the businesses you should buy.

Instead of paying to get your problem solved, why don’t you get paid to solve it for other people? 

Right now, boomers own $5-10 trillion worth of businesses.

And when these owners retire…

It’s either we buy these businesses, or BlackRock does.

I’d rather see more of us own our local than have PE swallow everything up.

1. Be obsessed

Every outsized outcome I’ve seen came from people who genuinely enjoy the pressure. Not motivated people. Obsessed people. It’s almost impossible to compete with someone who treats the thing you dread as fun.

2. Clean out your closet

Get rid of anything that doesn’t fit the person you’re becoming. Cluttered space creates cluttered thinking, and cluttered thinkers don’t make money. Changing how you show up physically is one of the fastest ways to change how you behave.

3. Clarify your ONE thing

Not five ideas. One. Put a number on it and give yourself 90 days to get there. You have to prove to yourself that you keep your word.

4. Tell a better story about yourself

Not a vision board. Write down the words. If your life were a book, what’s supposed to happen next? What goes wrong and how do you react to it? When challenges show up, it’s much easier to keep going if you already decided they were part of the plot.

5. Start a not-to-do list

Becoming elite means cutting distractions aggressively and doing fewer things better.

6. Eliminate distractions

Most distraction is optional so make it harder to waste time and easier to focus. Small changes here create outsized results.

7. Outwork people

If you wake up earlier, protect the first part of your day, and eliminate distractions, you will get ahead faster than you think. Because most people just aren’t willing to work hard.

8. Move in silence

When you’re actually changing your life, you don’t need an audience. Do cool shit. Then talk after the result.

Do this for 90 days and your life will look different.

Because you WILL be different.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_how-to-be-unrecognizable-in-90-days-1-activity-7429531227709136896-0lXt?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABZ7-HEBruCM6sZQ3V5BFFp4L-sCzx01HEI

Here's how to avoid these negotiation mistakes (& get the deal you deserve):

If you want to fail in negotiating and alway overpay... don’t read this.

Buyers with experience only negotiate on three variables that determine the value of a business.

Most sellers don't even understand these concepts, which gives you a massive advantage if you can educate them on how deals really work:

1. EBITDA/SDE

Contrary to popular belief, this isn't about the number on their P&L.

It's about the cash flow you’ll actually get when you take over.

Here’s an example:

If a seller says ""we made $500k last year"" but half of that came from a one-time contract that won't renew…

You can't pay for income that won't exist for you.

That's like buying a house and paying for the furniture they're taking with them.

Most buyers get destroyed here because they don't adjust for:

- Salary to replace owner
- Revenue concentration risks
- One-time events that won't repeat
- Expenses that will increase under new ownership

2. Multiple

Think of this as a direct reflection of risk.

Everything that increases risk lowers the multiple. Everything that decreases risk raises it.

That’s why some businesses trade at 15x while others struggle to get 2x.

Lower multiples come from:

- Revenue trending downward
- Business depends entirely on the seller
- Messy financials
- High employee turnover

These are red flags screaming ""this could fall apart tomorrow.""

Conversely, higher multiples come from the opposite:

- Documented systems and processes
- Diversified revenue streams
- Strong management team
- Clean books
- Consistent YOY growth

You can’t negotiate the multiple arbitrarily. It’s calculated with hard numbers.

But you can influence it by identifying and addressing the risks contractually rather than just pushing for a lower price.

You're buying the future but paying for the past.

The multiple reflects how confident you are in that future.

3. Terms

Price is what you pay, terms are how you pay.

You can give a seller their price IF you get your terms. Or you can give them their terms if you get your price.

But you CAN’T give them both.

It’s the law of price and terms:

Terms are how you hedge against every risk you identified in the deal. For example:

- If there’s key employee risk → Add retention bonuses to the deal
- Seller wants higher valuation? → Use seller financing
- Documentation not in place? → Long transition and training period

The idea is to use the contract to protect against your biggest fears.

At the end of the day, negotiation isn’t about winning.

It’s about getting what you want while keeping the other side happy enough that they don’t sabotage the deal.

I saw a stat that only 1 out of 10 Americans died rich.

That most die broke.

In a world full of knowledge and a society that's the best it's ever been that's all we got?

Broken.

Someone asked me recently, “Why do you think so many people never reach financial freedom?”

And I believe it’s because humans defer to the paths they have seen before them.

So often, we tend to follow in our parents’ footsteps.

But the internet has changed that.

You can follow in the footsteps of others who you’ve never even met before.

So then I started to think, is there just a lack of knowledge?

Do people just not know the tactical steps it takes to become wealthy?

It's not easy, but it is simple. It just takes someone to teach you.

Here’s how we think about building systems for our portfolio of 30+ businesses:,"The difference between a $1M business and a $100M business:

Systems.

Here’s how we think about building systems for our portfolio of 30+ businesses:

Think of systems like a car. You need:

- Vision = windshield (see where you're going)
- Dashboard = gauges (track your speed)
- Goals = GPS (know your destination)
- Communication = alerts (stay coordinated)
- People = maintenance (keep everything running)

Miss any one and you're broken down on the side of the road.

1. Start With The Foundation

Most owners focus on tiny processes instead of the big stuff.

It's like saying ""I want to build the Sistine Chapel"" then starting out by picking out what candles you want inside.

You have to start with the foundation first or you'll never get the thing done.

2. Use 'Proven' Frameworks

Everyone on the internet acts like they have the best new ""battle-tested"" system, when realistically it's often a lot of fluff.

That said, there is a lot of merit in implementing systems that have worked for someone else - just make sure you're getting them from the right place.

3. Follow Dual North Stars

The danger of single metrics is it creates tunnel vision.

But when you have two, they keep each other honest. It could be:

- Revenue + Followers
- Sales + Customer satisfaction
- Growth + Team retention

Just remember to keep one qualitative and the other quantitative.

4. Keep Pace With Your Yearly Vision

Without systems, it’s easy to get caught up in busywork.

I’ve met hardworking owners who thought they were moving the needle only to realize the opposite at EOY.

Building the right systems prevents that:

5. Use Scorecards

It’s not enough to give deadlines when assigning tasks.

You also want to create a dashboard where you can track:

- Completion rates
- Who’s responsible for what
- Color-coded status updates

That way, you can see a bird’s eye view of what's moving along and what isn’t.

6. Apply The Rule of Three for Documentation

Do you like repeating yourself? Me neither.

Anything you do more than 3 times in a week (or has at least 3 steps) should get documented.

Use Loom + Google Docs to create playbooks so specific that even a highschooler can follow.

- 

Only so much I can get into in a single post.

The best way to achieve it? Buying...

Building = years with no profit.
Buying = cashflow from day one.

When you buy a business, you're not gambling on potential. You're getting proven profits, existing customers, and someone else's 10,000 hours of work... Made yours overnight.

The wealth-building playbook has changed.

Old way: Build a startup, pray for funding, burn cash, hope to be the 1 in 100 that succeeds.

New way: Buy a business, use existing cashflow, own your time.

Less sexy? Maybe. But it works.

What type of business is smart to buy? You can use the SOWS shorthand:

S - Stale (little to no innovation)
O - Old (been around forever)
W - Weak (fragmented competition)
S - Simple (services people need daily)

These businesses are:
• Too small for PE firms..
• Not right for competitors..
• But the Goldilocks fit for someone like you.

And the timing is right on this opportunity:

→ Baby boomers are in the process of retiring en masse: 75M predicted by 2030
→ Millions of them are small business owners with no succession plan.
→ So what if you buying their business grants them retirement?

You can buy a business WITHOUT:
• Risking your savings
• Sacrificing your lifestyle
• Having previous ownership experience

Is it easy? No.
Is it worth it? I say yes.

This is my ""Zone of Genius"" framework for finding what business you shoul","The best superpower you can unlock:

Making money doing something you love.

This is my ""Zone of Genius"" framework for finding what business you should buy or start...

Biggest lie they told you:

“Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.”

Money doesn’t flow from passion. No kid is out there saying, “When I grow up, I want to work in self-storage.”

But what do you dream of as an adult? Stability. Money. Profitable biz's, like...

• Self-storage
• Home services
• Professional services
• Laundromats
• Real estate
• Trades

You’ll spend at least 1/3 of your life working. And passion DOES play an important role in you not wanting to slam your head against your desk every Monday.

So this begs the question...

What business SHOULD you go after?

I use this framework:

The Zone of Genius.

Here’s how it works:

Step 1: Get out a pen & paper. Write down the following:

- Experience & Skills. How. What are you so good at, people will pay you?
• Network. Who. Think LinkedIn contacts, family connections, etc.
• Passion. Why. What lights you up?

Step 2 is where the magic happens:

You find the overlap between all three.

Here are 3 quick examples:

1. Howard Schultz

Experience: sales at Xerox; ops at a Swedish housewares company

- Network: Italian coffee bar owners, original Starbucks owner
- Passion: coffee, conversation, ""third places""

= Starbucks (acquired after starting another coffee shop)

2. Alex

Experience: managing an entertainment business

- Network: vendors from that business
- Passion: magic, entertaining

= Innovative Imprints (acquired screen printing & merch company)

3. Codie (humor me)

Experience: managing funds, buying small businesses

- Network: business brokers, investors
- Passion: writing, helping other people find freedom through money

= Contrarian Thinking (investment, education & media startup)

And once you do all this… you now have your foundation.

But, you can’t tell the universe you found your Zone of Genius and then expect the right business to suddenly fall into your lap.

So luckily there’s a framework for hunting down your ideal business too…
It’s called a “deal box.”

Whether you run a VC-backed startup or freelance on the side, the US tax code favors busines","Stressed about what you pay in taxes?

Start a business.

Whether you run a VC-backed startup or freelance on the side, the US tax code favors business owners over everyone else.

Here are 7 tax-strategies owners can take advantage of (that 9-5ers can’t): 

Quick heads up first: Don’t take candy from strangers, don’t take tax advice from them either. Get a tax professional & then talk to them before doing anything wild.

Now, let’s get into it:

1. The Home Write-Off Advantage

Own a two bed apartment and work from home? 

Your W2 friends have to pay full rent, but as a biz owner? 

You can deduct the office space you use (potentially saving you thousands each year). 

2. The $10M QSBS Advantage 

Most people pay 20%+ on investment gains.

But with a qualifying C-Corp, QSBS can exclude $15M tax-free (with rules).

With the right tax planning, that number can grow substantially thanks to some legal loopholes with cost basis & trust stacking. 

It’s one of the strongest tax breaks in the code.

3. The $70K Solo 401k Play 

This is one of the biggest personal finance wins for anyone with self-employment income. 

A Solo 401k lets you contribute up to $70K in 2025 - and with your spouse, you can potentially move six figures into tax-deferred savings each year!

4. The S-Corp Split

Earn $100K+ outside of a W-2?

Setting up an S-Corp lets you split income into salary + distributions.

When you're self-employed, you have (up to) 15.3% payroll taxes on your income. With an S-Corp, you have no payroll taxes on your business owner income.

Reasonable salary still apply but this structure can lower self-employment taxes.

5. The 20% QBI Deduction

To qualify for QBI, your business must be a pass-through entity. 

That means your business needs to be operating as either a:

• Sole Proprietorship
• Partnership
• S Corporation
• LLC

Qualified business income is the net amount of a business' income, with a few exceptions (investment income, income from business outside US, certain interest income, etc). 

Helps you lower your taxable income. 

6. The Travel Points Strategy

Every business expense is an opportunity to earn rewards (ads, software, conferences).

A few foundational rules on credit card points: 

Rule 1: Never carry a balance (pay in full monthly)
Rule 2: Only use business cards for business expenses (don’t mix with personal)

For those who need to travel a lot, this often leads to massive savings. 

7. The Million-Dollar Mindset

W-2 workers ask: ""How can I save $1k?""
Biz owners ask: ""How can I make $100k?""

The tax code wasn’t built to punish employees.

It was built to incentivize people who create jobs, take risk, and build things.

Here's how to buy a biz, with less risk:

You can’t eliminate risk entirely.

But there are 3 M’s to remember:

- Minimization
- Mitigation
- Moderation

Here are tactical steps for each these phases to lower your risk of failure:

1. RISK MINIMIZATION (Deal Sourcing)

This is about finding a business that poses less risk to begin with.

Here are the 10 Value Markers we give our community members to weigh a biz’s risk:

- Financial Viability
- Diversification
- Employee-Centric Risk
- Owner-Centric Risk
- Cashflow vs Cashsuck
- Unfair Advantage
- Happy Customers / Reviews
- Recurring Revenue
- Upside Potential
- Documentation & Repeatable Processes

2. RISK MITIGATION (Negotiation)

This stage is about structuring the deal so you assume as little risk as possible.

A few quick tips:

- Don’t be greedy on your first deal, bring on other investors. It diversifies risk.
- Try to get seller financing. The seller is automatically incentivized to help you win.
- Tie some of the purchase price to work the seller will do with you over 1 year basis. (Seller Consultancy Contract)
- Tie some of the price to hitting xyz goals in the business. (Milestones & Earnouts)
- Hold cash in escrow until the biz hits the dollar amount it’s contracted to. (Holdbacks)
- Don’t have loan payments begin month 1. Give the business a quarter or two to stabilize without debt burden

3. RISK MODERATION (First 90 Days)

This is about how you control cash in the business once you're behind the wheel.

A few smart moves:

- Have on hand more cash than anticipated. Your biggest risk will always be running out of cash
- Partial acquisition. Before you buy an entire business, get partial ownership w/ a distributing equity. Gives you a chance to see behind the curtain
- Daily cashflow analysis. Watch your cash daily for the first 6 months to a year.
- Rolling cash flow statement. Make the business run on a cash basis first so you know your real cash on hand
- COA analysis. Use a model that analyzes up front if are you still cash flow positive if the business drops by 10-25-50%
- Subject matter expert. Ensure you are, you hired, or the business already has a good one.

Save this post.

Do these things.

And in theory, your likelihood of a failed acquisition drastically decreases.

These steps might lower your chances of a failed acquisition, but don't eliminate it entirely.

The same logic applies to running your biz…sometimes shit happens.

One of the reasons why I’ve partnered with Next Insurance.

15 other harsh business truths for you:

1. The greatest muscle you can build is urgency. Bureaucracy is business poison.

2. Decrease the time between having an idea and getting it done. Everything changes.

3. Never sacrifice reputation in the name of business. You can always start another company. You can never create a new reputation.

4. Long-term games and long-term people compound. Resist shiny objects.

5. Hire smart people, pay them well, set them up for success... Then leave them the hell alone.

6. “There’s nothing worse than being sick, fat, tired and trying to run your business.” - Dana White

7. The highest ROI investment founders & owners can make is in themselves. Health shapes mindset. Mindset shapes action.

8. You're better off learning negotiation than financial modeling. Business is less spreadsheets than words.

9. The best business of all time has only you, a computer, and the send button.

10. Every additional employee increases complexity. Hiring is a last resort.

11. The best advice comes from those just a couple steps ahead of you. These people still vividly remember the problems you're facing today.

12. Sell painkillers, not vitamins. There's more money in needs than wants.

13. No discounts. Compete on value, not price. Any biz with $$$ can enter your market and bleed you out. Differentiate beyond commodity.

14. A happy customer is the most powerful marketing. Prioritize reviews. Humans are social animals.

15. If no one thinks you’re crazy, you’re too late. If everyone thinks your idea is good? Even worse. Outsized returns lie in non-conformism.

I didn't give up a paycheck til I replaced it. 
I didn't quit my job until I had a backup. 
I didn't jump all in to one thing. 
 
If that’s you too, here are 10 rules for buying a business (with a little less risk): 
 
1. Don't buy an unprofitable business or turnaround. 
 
2. Beware of personal guarantee loans (especially on your first deal). 
 
3. De-risking = diversifying. You don't need to fund an entire deal yourself. Leverage seller financing, investors, business loans. 
 
4. Avoid owner-centric businesses. They might not stand once the key man leaves. 
 
5. Don't get emotionally attached to a deal. 
 
6. 100% ownership isn't the only path to success (especially on a 1st deal). Look into sweat equity or partial ownership. 
 
7. Don't project for ""ideal"" numbers. Do worst-case scenario planning. 
 
8. Do. Not. Run. Out. Of. Cash. 
 
9. There's no ""perfect business."" Only a perfect business for you. Balance deal size & your lifestyle/skills. 
 
10. Don't keep your deal private. Find a network to pressure test each deal. 
 
I could list a thousand other rules.

But if you're hungry for more, you can come to my live event in a few weeks.

February 20-22. 100% online.

I'll go over:
• How to know if biz-buying is right for you
• How to skip the worst mistakes
• Live deal making

Shrink your timelines...

When you say next quarter, push for next 60 days.

When you say next month, push for 2 weeks.

When you say next week, push for 24 hours.

Not everything will get done on the new timeline, but you'll build a habit that will make you more successful than other people.

Decrease the time between having an idea and getting it done. Everything changes.

1. Marrying well is the biggest life hack of all.

2. Be the type of person who reaches out to others... when you don't need something.

3. The greatest muscle you can build is urgency.

4. Most successful people move with this mindset: Entitled to nothing, willing to earn everything.

5. Pray like it's up to God. Work like it's up to you.

6. You don't need more time, you need a deadline.

7. The success you are looking for is waiting for you in the work you are currently avoiding.

8. Biographies of billionaires teach you more than self-help books.

9. Your lack of focus will kill you before your competitors ever get a chance.

10. Winning isn't an accident, it's earned.

11. Underrated superpower: Just dumb enough to believe in yourself, just smart enough to execute.

12. Complexity makes you seem smart. Simplicity makes you money.

13. Surround yourself with owners, the conversation is just different.

14. The more you learn about money, the more you realize most of us play with Legos while the really rich play chess.

15. Beginners do too much. Pros do only what's needed.

16. Underperformers want ease. Midperformers want credit. Winners want pressure.

17. Your most expensive mistake will be a ""who,"" not a ""what.""

18. If you've survived this far, the odds are actually are in your favor.

19. The formula is: keep going after it gets hard.

Worst part? The people.

Business horror story time:

I hired an exec, paid her $200k a year + $200k in bonus.

She secretly launches 2 side businesses, tries to take our clients to one, and was secretly launching a competing product all within the first 6 months.

Yikes.

We found out, let her go (obviously), but I had to chuckle because she bankrupted her last company... and then changed her name since she now claims it was a success.

Moral of the story...

If you're in business, expect it.

Protect your house because your biggest costs will always be wrong people trusted.

– My dad

If you do 1 thing a year as a father, make it:

A father daughter trip.

You can’t get back time. So this year we went off grid to far East Arizona...

Here’s 13 lessons from the road:

1. Take trips with your parents while you can. I told our uber driver that we were going on a father daughter trip, and she said, “That’s amazing, I wish my dad was still around.” Summarizes exactly why I do this trip each year.

2. So much knowledge is lost from one generation to the other, because we never asked. I learned this weekend more about hunting, fly fishing, tracking elk, and Arizona back countries than most will ever know.

3. Met a woman named Wink. She’s 85, runs the ranch and can ride a horse, bale hay and hike faster than almost any 30 year old I know. I’m starting to think we LET our bodies get old. Also I hope someone writes about me like they do her, “A woman with grit and cow sense”

4. Cowboys speak another language. We asked “Where do the cows hang out mostly?” They said, “Well, reckon right about where they want.” We asked, “What’s your dog’s name?” She replied, “Dog.” I like them.

5. Cats are metal as f when not domesticated. You ever seen a barn cat? Maybe we should have never let those little murderers into our homes.. they’re just biding their time.

6. Cows do not want to be snuggled. Turns out all those videos on Instagram of snuggling cows are a bunch of liars. I tried a few times. Results were not great. I repeat, do not attempt to snuggle a cow.

7. You’ll never remember the things you never even tried. So, just try it.

8. We need more weekends without cell service as an option. When it’s not an option, it’s not a desire. Take a modern day service diet.

9. America is not found in urban cities. It’s found on the plains and the backwoods and the places with roads paved in dirt. They know all their neighbors, they count last names back in generations, they remember a fire or flood years ago… they are builders. And they don’t ask for permission.

10. The more rugged you go, the more rugged you become. And that’s a good thing. Self sustainability, growing your own food, weathering storms… there’s a reason Americans were tough.

11. Airbnb is not welcome here. Fast money, new people, not taking care of one another. Your bank account here is measured in impact not 0’s.

12. Mother nature is the ultimate antidepressant. There is just no way to not be in wonder while hiking a trail no man has before. While running into a beaver slapping his tail. While tracking an elk and bugling at him and he bugles back. Take a walk, get lost, get found.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_youll-look-back-and-wish-you-were-a-better-activity-7400534042590212096-PAzv?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE0B4ksBsfe1athTetp5PvIHfXIajcjPH_c

At 39, I know I’m just getting started.

The biggest lessons this past year taught me (that you might need to hear too):

1. Marrying well is the biggest life hack of all. Period.

2. You must learn to be disliked or you will find yourself stuck in a prison of other people's beliefs. 

3. Nobody ultimately cares about your life...They think about you for one second and then think about themselves again. So you might as well do what you want. 

4. Most successful people I've met aren't that smart. They move fast, they take risk, they work a lot. That's it. 

5. You don't need more time, you need a deadline. 

6. The sweet spot for success: Just dumb enough to believe in yourself, just smart enough to execute. 

7. When you hang out in rooms with people who have way more zeros than you, your problems are so small to them they can see into your future. 

8. Waking up early, being married, going to church, reading books, going to bed at 10pm, drinking less, and staying home more is actually amazing. Sorry, old people. I was wrong. 

9. The world is run by people who are probably less smart than you. Stop underestimating yourself. 

10. When you can’t be controlled, you’ll be hated. 

11. You are exactly as successful as you programmed yourself to be. 

12. Your anxiety is lying to you. You will be fine. You've survived this far, the odds actually are in your favor. 

13. Struggle is a gift. I've never met someone massively successful who hasn't gone through something that nearly destroyed them. 

14. Success demands solitude. 

15. Being fit is hard. Being fat is hard. Entrepreneurship is hard. Working a 9-5 is hard. Being miserable is hard. Doing the right thing is hard. Choose your hard.

And one of the best decisions I've ever made was becoming an owner. 

It's not easy...but nothing worth doing ever is. 

If your goal for 2026 is to become an owner, you should come to my Main Street Millionaire Live event next week.

7 Main Street millionaires I met last year who did it (how they make $):

1. Trash

“This is gonna be forever. Trash is forever.” –Spencer of Lone Star Trash

His neighborhood trash service sucked. so he bought a truck & bins and stepped in to provide better service. Made $30k in his first 11 days.

2. Street Sweeping

“How can I make it so I don't fail? At minimum, I learn & lose 60k. At most, I have a profitable business.” –Brandon of Cleaner Streets

He had no prior experience. Bought his business from a 75-year-old owner who desperately wanted to retire. The deal was 100% seller financed, and last we spoke he scaled it from $15k/mo → $75k/mo.

3. Shipping Containers

“We had one of the few container home websites with example photos, prices, & delivery.” –Bob of Bob’s Containers

He started out just buying & selling containers. Then he flipped one into into a home. It took 3 weeks and sold for $35k. From there, he repeated & scaled.

4. Window Cleaning

“Our strategy was simple: whatever everybody else is doing, let’s do the opposite of that.” –Brandon of Pink's

Carter & Brandon got laid off during Covid. They saw opportunity in the services with a window cleaning biz. Within 3 years, they scaled to $1M+, with ~40% margins after their salaries. (Disclaimer: I own part of their business. They're cool dudes.)

5. Power Washing

“When you're willing to work, competent & relentless in execution, it turns out pocketbooks open.” –Aaron of Rolling Suds

He strategically bought his biz in a fragmented industry: power washing. Now his business is an empire, having scaled from $30k per YEAR → $800k per MONTH and 187 locations nationwide (when we last met).

6. Porta Potties

“Seeing all that trash, it was like... somebody's makin' a lot of money.” –Russell of Shep Boys

With no prior experience, he started renting porta potties.. then water tanks, then fountains... He grew from a few units to over 1,500 with $1M in revenue by year 2.

7. Painting

“I didn't need a lot of equipment, marketing, a team.. It was something I could just, do.” –Steven of That 1 Painter

He started with $12 in his bank account. Year one he finished solo at $100k. With his first crew, he cleared $500k. Now? His company is franchised across the nation (I own part of this one, too).

These owners will be the first to tell you — they’re not rich because they’re gifted.

They simply aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty, learn new skills, and work hard when others would give up.

Entrepreneurship is hard.

You'll lose money, sleep, time, and at the end of the day… It’s statistically likely that you’ll still fail.

Business IS risk.
You SHOULD expect to fail.
You can never FULLY eliminate risk.

But...

There is 1 path to entrepreneurship that increases your chance of success:

Acquisition.

Buying a business, THEN building it.

Let’s look at the failure rates of the most common acquisition loan…

Default rate for SBA 7(a) loans:
• 2021 best year: 1.02%
• 2008 worst year: 24.7%

Compare to the failure rate of startups:
• 23% fail within 1 year
• 48% fail after 5 years
• 65% fail after 10 years

So why do acquisitions fail LESS?

3 main reasons:

1. The bank won’t give you a loan if the business is clearly a bad idea financially.
2. Cashflow covers a multitude of sins. Even unhealthy acquired biz's can generate cash.
3. Lindy Effect: the longer it has succeeded, the more likely it is to continue succeeding.

But the fact is, despite lower failure rates…

Acquisitions can still be catastrophic failures.

Why?

It often boils down to 1 of 3 issues:

1. It was a risky/bad deal to begin with.
2. The deal price and/or terms set up the buyer for failure.
3. Bad cash management (this is the #1 reason ANY business fails)

Don’t want your acquisition to fail?

Simple. Don’t make one of those mistakes.

Piece of cake, right? 😉

Our generation NEEDS to do h","Warning: I will bully every one of you into doing deals, committing to a partner, reading books, and building something.

Our generation NEEDS to do hard things.

Here’s exactly why:

- There’s 333 million Americans
- 1 in 10 own a business
- But 77% owners are OVER the age of 45

It’s time for the next generation to step up.

They say 10,000 boomers retire a day, which means:

- Someone needs to run those businesses
- But the majority of kids DO NOT want to take over the family biz
- So opportunity is uniquely big for buyers

Because small businesses have 3 potential fates once their owner is ready to move on:

1. They shut down.

2. They’re bought up by institutions and corporations.

3. OR people like you from your community step up and keep Main Street local.

Problem is...

Most people have no clue how to buy a small business. Or why they should. Or if they should.

But my mission is to build a nation of owners. To teach this from the ground up.

Even if it takes a little bullying ;)

So…

If you’ve read this far, I have something special for you:

I’m hosting a 3-day live event called Main Street Millionaire in February. 

Maybe you...

- Don't know how to find the right business for you
- Don't know how to analyze the numbers
- Or, don't know where to even start

PE slop is destroying America.

Private equity has turned every strip mall into “copy-pastable” template that’s taking the soul out of our local communities.

Here’s a quick breakdown of “PE slop” (and the opportunity it creates):

You've probably felt it but couldn't name it:

Walk into your local coffee shop, restaurant, or home service company...

Something feels off.

There’s a reason for that:

In 2000, private equity firms managed 4% of total U.S. corporate equity.

By 2021, that number had gone up to 20%.

That's a 5x increase of firms optimizing your Main Street for spreadsheets instead of soul.

That said, PE isn't pure evil.

In 2024, PE-backed companies employed 13.3M workers earning $1.1 trillion in wages.

That's an average of $85K per worker.

But in order to get systems, capital, and efficiency, we traded down and lost soul.

Private equity's mandate is:

- Generate returns for institutional investors
- Turn money into more money
- Do it in a 3-7 year window

Their investors are pensions, endowments, family offices.

They're fiduciaries, not families.

Compare that to the individual owner.

They're not chasing maximum IRR over 5 years.

They want respectable income, purpose, and independence.

They want to own their time and build something worth handing to their kids.

The good news is many owners actually WANT to sell to someone who cares personally about the product, people, and town.

Someone who understands what it means to serve the same customers for 30 years.

But there's massive friction...

There are too many roadblocks that keep good buyers out:

- Owner's books are a mess
- They're not financially ready
- They're not psychologically ready

Many owners ARE their business.

Selling feels like dying. So they hold on until it's too late.

Therein lies an opportunity:

Thousands of small businesses will NEVER make sense for private equity.

They’re too small. Too messy. Too local.

But they're perfect for driven individuals who want ownership...and many of you reading this fit this bill…

Our goal at Contrarian Thinking isn't just to preserve jobs.

It's to create new paths to ownership that keeps pride, people, employees, and community in the equation.

To make it easier for everyday people to step in.

And keep Main Street from turning into a giant bowl of slop.

That said, ""easier"" doesn't mean ""easy.""

Most people aren't built for the pressure of ownership.

But those who are can literally rewrite what this country looks and feels like.

One biz at a time.

The timing couldn't be better.

AI and tech are shortening traditional career ladders.

For those who want control over their time and future, buying a business isn't just aspirational anymore.

It's practical.

And if you're still reading this, I have something for you to nudge you along your ownership journey.

I put together a guide with the 5 best businesses to buy in 2025 & the common mistakes to avoid.

1. They build it from scratch instead of buy.
2. They take months or years to cashflow.
3. They go for biz's doomed for failure...

I've developed a framework that avoids these mistakes.

I call it SOWS.

SOWS tells you the *types* of businesses you should buy.

You use it for finding biz's with:
• Lower risk
• Profitability
• A reasonable price
• Potential for growth
• Simple (not easy) execution

SOWS stands for Stale, Old, Weak, & Simple.

It's a straightforward way to screen your first deals and build upon them. Let’s dive in:

1. Stale

Half the businesses in your hometown fit. The place runs okay, but:
• No testimonials
• Website from 2005
• Limited social media
• Still use a fax machine

This leaves a lot of room for easy innovation when you buy... AND you don't price that into the purchase.

2. Old

These are businesses that have existed for 5+ years. If you want cashflow... Give me a 25-year-old car wash over a startup run by 25-year-olds any day.

The Lindy Effect says if it's existed for some time it will likely continue to exist. Old biz’s can be hidden gems.

3. Weak

Buy a biz with poor competition. When was the last time you got a plumber:
• On time
• With automated billing
• Who sent follow-up texts?

There are 3 easy fixes right there to make you better than competitors.

4. Simple

Simple business model. Simple operations.

If you can easily explain your first few deals to an 8-year-old, you’re on the right track.

Don’t get distracted by shiny things when working toward your first business.

Run with what already works.

Just make it better.

Here's the map for a business that runs without you (& attracts serious buy,"Build your business so it’s sellable… and you’ll never be forced to sell.

Here's the map for a business that runs without you (& attracts serious buyers):

Most people run their business until they're miserable. And then try to sell.

Don't be most people.

First step…

Your goals and objectives will tell you what you want out of the sale.

""Codie, my goal is to sell for as much as possible. Duh.”

Which is sort of true…

But what you’re really after is making a lot of money without having to stay at your company until you die.

Which is where a goals matrix comes in:

1. Money: What’s your minimum price
2. Timeline: When do you want out
3. Team: How do they win
4. Transition: How long you stay after sale
5. Legacy: Who you'll sell to

These set the guardrails for your sale.

Next, figure the value of your business.

We teach these 10 markers to Contrarian Community students valuing businesses to buy. From the sellers' side of this coin, you can improve these 10 things to manually increase the value of your business.

Now, the game is figuring out how to bridge the gap between:

1. How much you want to sell your biz for
2. How much it’s actually worth

One way to bridge this gap comes down to who's buying.

In any sale, there are two types of buyers who'll look at your biz:

• Financial buyers (want cash flow)
• Strategic buyers (want your secret sauce)

Now we find out who will help you sell. How much you'll sell for determines who you work with:

• Over $10M = M&A advisor
• Under $10M = Business broker
• Under $100k = direct listing on BizScout (disclosure, I own)

To make your biz as sexy as possible for potential buyers, create a business plan that answers these questions:

• Who are your customers?
• What unique solution do you offer?
• Why now, and why is this deal an absolute no-brainer?

The goal is to sell the dream to the buyer.

Keep in mind that institutional investors & strategic buyers see 2000+ deals a year. To make your story stand out, talk about:

• Why you've been successful
• Why it's going to continue to grow and be even more successful under them.

And when you've finally made it to due diligence, remember two things:

1. Don't take your eye off the business
2. Let your broker handle the buyers’ questions

Your job is keeping the momentum going, not getting distracted by the sale.

And last but not least, understand that this process takes time. You should expect:

• 1-2 months prepping to sell
• 2-3 months marketing the business
• 3-6 months closing the deal
• 1-3 months transition period

The bigger your business, the longer they'll want you around.

Lots of folks lose money fast because they try to expedite one of these steps.

It’s good to move fast, but it’s better to be intentional and methodical.

Only fools rush in.

You’re no fool (right?).

So use what I call the 3-6-12 framework:

1/ At least 3 months to learn about deal-making:

- The terms. The financials. The roles, responsibilities, and tactics.
• Business-buying is a language. Maybe you know a few words. But you need to be fluent.
• There’s no such thing as a perfect business. Only a perfect business FOR YOU. Figure out exactly what that business looks like before you start looking for it.

2/ At least 6 months to work toward sourcing, negotiating, and securing a deal:

- You could look at 50 business before you submit an LOI for one.
• You could submit 25 LOIs before one is accepted.
• You could perform 10 rounds of due diligence before you find The One.

3/ At least 12 months post-purchase to fully acclimate to the ins and outs of a business:

- The crazy thing about buying a business is… You then own a business.
• Like it or not, it typically takes an entire year to fully integrate yourself and understand it inside out.

Ever heard that Warren Buffett saying?

“You can't produce a baby in 1 month by getting nine women pregnant.”

You CAN have the business you want.

But smart investments take time.

1. Ones that take your money (cash-suck)
2. Ones that make you money (cash-flow)

Here are 14 actions to turn any cash-suck business into one that cash-flows:

First, what’s a cash-suck business?

• You provide service, then get paid
• You make money a few times a year
• You have one big client (if they leave, you're toast)

Compare that to a cash-flow business:

• You get paid, then provide service
• You make monthly recurring revenue
• You have lots of diverse clients

See how there’s a world of difference between the two?

Most businesses you buy will be cash-suck operations. Your goal in the first 90 days should be to turn that around.

I call it the Cash-Flow Boomerang Process.

Think of it as throwing out cash and having it fly back to you immediately:

1. Shorten your payment terms

Most businesses default to Net 30 payment terms because... that's what everyone else does.

Switch to Net 24 ( within 24 hours of completion). You can even go as far as taking 50% upfront.

First rule of business: don't work for free.

2. Get payment info from customers when they book

Have them sign a document that allows you to charge their card upon completion.

This one change removes the awkward ""Where's my money?"" conversation and speeds up your cash conversion cycle dramatically.

3. Offer discounts for cash payments

• You avoid credit card fees (often 3-5%)
• Customers love the discount
• You get money instantly

This is literally a win-win for both sides and puts cash in your account faster.

4. Diversify your client base

When 1 client represents 15%+ of your revenue, that's not a business. It's a hostage situation, and you're the hostage.

I've seen businesses collapse because they lost their ""whale client.""

Diversify, or accept that you're a glorified employee.

5. Create recurring revenue

For any product or service you offer, ask: ""Could this be a subscription?""

The answer is nearly always yes.

If you make most of your revenue from one season or event, your #1 priority should be creating year-round cash flow.

(For the rest of the list...go to the carousel!) 

Anyways, everybody knows most businesses fail within the first 5 years.

But how many realize 82% of those closures are due to cashflow issues?

That’s how important cash is.

You could be making money on paper while your bank account tells a different story.

The key to not becoming another statistic is simple, but not easy:

Don't run out of cash.

Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, but cash is king.

Prioritize those metrics in that ascending order and you should be fine.

P.S. If post made you rethink about what you’re doing in your business…

Come to my masterclass about finding hidden cash in your biz. 

It's happening next week (and it's free).

1. Never take risk.

2. Take risks you don’t understand.

Here’s how to minimize your risk when buying your first business:

There’s no such thing as the right or wrong business.

There’s only the business that’s right or wrong for you.

That’s why I created the Contrarian Deal Clarity Framework.

You need to define 5 components:

1. Your Ideal Owner Experience

Saying “I want to leave my 9-5” is too wishy-washy.

To trade in your W2 form, your vision board needs to be specific on three things:

• Personal goals (do you want more family time or grind for yourself)
• Income goals (replace your $75k salary or build an empire)
• Business goals (be a hands-on operator or absentee owner)

2. Your Zone of Genius

Think of this as the intersection where these three elements overlap:

• Passion (what you love)
• Skills & Experience (what you’re good at)
• Network (who you know)

Most people ignore this and buy businesses they hate running in 6 months.

Don’t be most people.

3. Business Size

It’s easy to fantasize about buying a Fortune 500 company.

But we’re not playing the billionaire game here.

As a first-time time buyer, look for micro acquisitions:

• <$1M cost
• $50K-$200K profits
• 1-3X multiples

Less competition, more opportunity, fewer headaches.

4. Profit

It’s important to remember you’re not just buying a business for the sake of it.

Your acquisition MUST be an income stream that can cover:

1. Debt service
2. Operator salary (if relevant)
3. Growth/working capital
4. Your earnings

I use these two tests to evaluate if a deal is worth looking at:

The SOWS Test

Before I buy anything, I ask if the business is:

• Stale - Does the owner still use fax machines
• Old - Is it 5+ years old with repeat customers
• Weak - Does competition suck at marketing
• Simple - Can an 8-year-old could understand it

The more boxes it checks, the better.

The BRIT Test

Then I check to see if it’s BRIT:

• Buy - Must be a cashflow, not cash-suck businesses
• Resist - Recession-proof
• Increase - Can I raise prices (most owners undercharge by 30%)
• Tech - Can I add simple technology to improve it?
Which brings us to the last component of our Deal Box framework:

5. Industry

First, you have to realize certain industries have high failure rates and should not be your first business.

Think restaurants or hotels...

On the flip side, these are my favorite businesses for first-time buyers:

• Digital Businesses (build once, sell forever)
• Home Services (roof repair / lawn care)
• Professional Services (e.g CPAs)
• Real Estate Enhanced (laundromats/car washes)

Once you get clear on your Deal Box, decisions become clearer.

You stop wasting time on deals that don’t fit and get closer to buying your first biz.

We hired 10 high-level people in 90 days:   50,000+ people viewed our jobs. 3,178 applied.","How many candidates do you need to see to find A-Players? 

We hired 10 high-level people in 90 days: 

50,000+ people viewed our jobs.
3,178 applied.
10 got hired.

That’s a 0.31% acceptance rate fyi. 

For every 1 hire, we reviewed 323 applications. 

Finding top talent is not glamorous. It’s mostly about saying no. Over and over.

What I have learned to find A Players: 

1. Take it seriously. Everything is a who problem past your first $1million, and the average CEO has no idea how much time the best CEO's spend on hiring. 10x more time.

2. Hire for attitude first, not skills. Easier to teach skills than change attitude.

3. Play the long game. The best people are usually already employed by someone else so reach out and form relationships before you’re even looking. 

4. For senior hires: it’s either a f*ck yes or a f*ck no - there’s no middle ground.

5. And a bonus one that Dave Ramsey taught me (also about senior hires): Always take them and their spouse out to dinner with yours. You’ll learn all you need to know.

Hiring is brutal. But when you get it right, it compounds faster than almost anything else you do.

Super pumped about the people we just brought on. They’re killers.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_how-many-candidates-do-you-need-to-see-to-activity-7425901357015949312-s_s0?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABoBKrsBx3ozlVCrBn34fGmjwCmWu7INH6k

A weekend well used is a jumpstart.

So I took that to heart. I bought my first business only using weekends and 5-9 outside my 9-5. I copied my homework for you…

I’ve spent months orchestrating a 3-day workshop where you leave with a business-buying playbook tailored to YOUR situation.

Here's the plan:

→ You will learn how to find right business for YOU using our Contrarian Deal Clarity Framework
→ How to find a business that’s ready to sell (using the 7 Ds of business selling)
→ Where to look on market & off market to find the most profitable deals
→ Live deal reviews so you can see how pros analyze financials
→ How to structure & negotiate a deal
→ Questions to ask to de-risk it
→ All 100% virtual

We’re also bringing in a ton of special guest speakers:

→ Vanessa Van Edwards 
(You’ll learn how to you say the right things, at the right time, in the right way)

→ Pace Morby 
(You’ll learn creative financing options so you don’t need to buy 100% cash)

→ Dean Graziosi
(You’ll learn from someone who has been involved in 13+ companies that have generated over 1 billion dollars in revenue)

This event is:

• Not really for you if you want to sit back and listen to people read powerpoint slides.
• Definitely for you if you're ready to make progress toward buying a business.

If you’ve read this far, you’re probably a fit.

Aging is truly the most incredible, underrated part of life… but for some reason, we all fear it.

We lie about our age or refuse to say how old we are.
We yearn for our 20’s when we had fewer scars and less responsibility.

But the thing is, our years are earned. Our scars are remnants of a life well lived. And I am proud of my years and my scars.


There is a natural gift that comes with time:

You get more comfortable in your own skin.
You stop chasing the approval of others.
You start trusting yourself more.
You gain calm and clarity.
You stop performing.

These changes are SO powerful.

I think about these words from my dad often, especially on my birthday every year:

“I remember my teens and 20’s. I thought those were the best years of my life.

Then I reached my 30’s, then my 40’s. Turns out, those were the best years of my life.

I was really scared to turn 50. Then, my 50’s were the best years of my life.

Now I’m in my 60’s. I may have slowed down a little bit—but these are the best years of my life.”


I plan to keep this attitude toward aging for the rest of my life. And I hope that you do, too.

Here’s to getting older and better every single year. Thank you for celebrating with me. ✨",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thejackiehermes_today-is-my-40th-birthday-and-this-is-going-activity-7430610636633681920-M8Wv?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB0q1vsBp4hULNTjGJX-vWVJ4DU-a38UXeY

For the last few years, we’ve all been told that the office would “come back.” We’d return to our desks, our commutes, and the 9–5 we were so desperate to escape.

But here’s the truth:

→ Remote and hybrid work are not going anywhere
→ Flexibility is a benefit people aren’t willing to give up
→ And “return to office” is failing... loudly and publicly

Why? Because people aren’t just fighting to work in their pajamas.

They’re fighting for freedom, trust, and to be treated like adults.

Here’s what I’ve learned leading a mostly remote company:

Your policies are a reflection of your leadership’s level of confidence
Flexibility doesn’t mean chaos (but you need clear expectations)
Most people want to do a good job and go about their lives
Good policies are built from trial, error, and iteration
Treating people like adults gets adult results
You can’t build trust without giving it first
Presence doesn’t = performance


Our team has tried all kinds of policies—here’s what works for us:

✔️ Remote-first work with monthly coworking time to help with things like brainstorming, relationship building, etc.

✔️ Flexing in/out of business hours with clear expectations around availability to collaborate

✔️ Half-day Fridays every Friday (not just summers, because burnout is real)

✔️ PTO with set time off (unlimited did NOT work), including additional time for volunteering, voting, a flex holiday, and more

✔️ Most importantly, adopting the overall mentality that everyone is an adult and should be treated as such

Leaders, remember this:

You can’t cover up bad policies with perks. At the end of the day, it comes down to how people are treated.

Personally, let’s just say that parenting, especially parenting teens, is not for the faint of heart.

I’ve learned that we are all just people, armed with our lived experiences and the knowledge we gather, trying to do the best we can in every situation.

If there’s a moral to this post, it’s this:

Let’s try to give each other more grace.
Be as understanding as possible.
Be open to perspectives.
Be more forgiving.
Be flexible.
Be kind.


This is the energy I’m taking into 2026.


How was this year for you? Business and personal, I’d love to hear it all! ❤️

I am usually pretty bad about looking back at milestones and celebrating wins.

So today, I wanted to write about all the messy moments that somehow turned into 4 years and 300 episodes of this podcast.

The first time I recorded was in a studio. It was a single room with a bunch of people staring at me while I was sweating bullets. I was terrified.

I quickly moved my recording process to my house. I had no idea what to buy or how to set anything up.

There were so many moments like that.

→ Recording with kids yelling in the background, cats meowing, me shushing.
→ Taking my mic on vacation with me because I didn’t get to my episodes before I left. (NEVER AGAIN.)
→ Starting episodes five times because the words wouldn’t come out right. Or even better, forgetting to hit record at all.
→ Trying not to cry on guest episodes because their stories were so moving or lessons so insightful (this has happened a number of times!).
→ Accidentally saying something completely unhinged. Constantly. 🤣

There were nights I recorded half-asleep.
Mornings I recorded before anyone else was awake.
Days I almost quit because life felt heavy and the last thing I wanted to do was act like I had advice to share.

At the same time, there is also so much beauty that comes with 4 years and 300 episodes. Especially the messages:
“I feel seen.”
“I needed this today.”
“This helped more than you know.”

These messages are the real reason this show made it to 300 episodes.

Somewhere along the line, I found my voice. Not the polished one I thought I needed (Quentin Michael Allums used to say I had a ‘video voice’ lmao!)—but the one I always had.

If you’ve been listening for a while or listened to even one episode: thank you for being part of my messy, strange, beautiful journey!

I used to joke that work was my only hobby. And it was.

In the last few years, I finally discovered that having interests/hobbies outside of work makes me a better person.

Who knew??


How hobbies and interests outside of work make you a better person:

✅ If you’re like me, your to-do list is running on a constant loop in your brain. Engaging in other activities forces me to stop thinking about work and has massively reduced my stress.

✅ Activities outside of work broaden your worldview. Meeting people outside of your immediate community, family, and circle is crucial. The more people I meet, the more I see the viewpoints of others, the less upset I get when bad things happen to me.

✅ Stepping away allows you to see the larger picture. People love to say “if it won’t matter in 5 years, it shouldn’t matter today” (or something), but that’s way easier said than done. When you see the larger picture, you understand where work fits into the harmony that is your life, and prioritize your thoughts appropriately.


My current hobbies/interests:

➡️ Boating while it’s warm. My husband and I joined a boating club four years ago and we’re having a blast. Let’s be real, he does all the driving. I will, however, advise him on how to do it. 🤣 Sorry Ryan Calton.

➡️ Exercising/movement. I’m always trying to conquer a new goal. I work out at F45 Training and let me tell you… it’s hard. I’m sore most days. And it’s worth it. 💪

➡️ Going to Milwaukee Bucks Inc. games—SO pumped for the season to start! I was never a big “sports person” until a handful of years ago, but how can you not love our guy Giannis? Add cat dad Myles Turner to the mix and it's sure to be a great season. #FeartheDeer

We start ,"Fun fact #500 that no one tells you about growing a biz or your career: you have to become a different person over and over and over again.

We start a business because we’re good at solving problems. We are excellent at the work we do. This is super similar when you start a corporate career—you are the one *doing* the work.

In both of these situations, being scrappy and quick and super hands-on is what makes you awesome.

Then suddenly, you’re managing people. And you’re supposed to delegate and only get involved when you need to and coach people to be good at the job like you were.

Then suddenly, you’re managing MORE people. And you’re supposed to be even more hands off and be a leader and guide people but not do the work yourself.

Then suddenly, you’re in a position of leadership. And you’re supposed to align your teams and implement the vision and hold people accountable.

And maybe, you’re in charge of the whole dang company. You’re a “visionary” whatever that means. 🤣 Zero pressure.


I feel like people start this journey and there is no “how to grow in your career and become a different person repeatedly for dummies” book.

And examining yourself at every single one of these stages is HARD.

You go from:
Being a contributor to making other people better
Being rewarded for speed to being rewarded for clarity
Solving problems yourself to teaching others to solve them
Getting validation from output to getting validation from outcomes
Being useful when busy to being useful when systems work without you


Now ask yourself honestly:
Am I the person I need to be right now? If not, how do I become her?
Do things slow down when I’m involved? Am I the bottleneck?
Do people wait for my input instead of taking ownership?
Am I constantly jumping in to “help”? (still guilty here)
Do I feel frustrated when things aren’t my way?
Is my calendar full but impact unclear?
Am I reacting instead of planning?
Ultimately: am I the problem???


This part is uncomfortable. It forces you to look at where ego or old habits might be getting in the way. And unfortunately, a lot of leaders don’t even do it.

But professional growth requires it.

If you’re feeling stuck, frustrated, or exhausted, it might mean that you’re hitting your upper limit. And it’s time to become the next version of yourself.

Leaders, what have you learned during this journey? I’ll go first in the comments.

Caffeine was expensive and I consume a lot of it, so I bought Alani drink mix and it made my face tingle.

And if it’s a service where you tip? Tip extra.

When you support a small business, please support it fully. Pay well and pay proudly. Don’t make your friends shrink their worth because you’re in their circle.

Last year was a tough year for a lot of businesses. If you can’t afford to buy from friends, there are plenty of things that you can do absolutely free!

1. Like, comment on, and share their content
2. Talk about them in rooms they’re not in
3. Leave thoughtful reviews
4. Send them leads
5. Be their sounding board


At the end of the day, supporting friends isn’t about a transaction... it’s about respect.

And the way you treat their business says a lot about how you value them.

YES, you can have a great idea, a following, a business, plan, etc. But IMO, without customers, you do not yet have a business. 

And yet… I often see companies prioritizing everything else before selling. Is it fear? Discomfort? Wanting to be “ready”? (Pro tip: just like having kids, there is never a perfect time to start. 🤣)

In last week’s episode of my podcast, I broke down exactly how I’d start building a company with one goal: getting paid.

Here’s the framework I break down:
Start with a sellable / solvable problem
Sell before building infrastructure
Focus on audience and a clear offer
Let revenue shape your brand


If this feels uncomfortable, I hate to say it, but... good? Selling is for most people.

But comfort comes from customers and cash in the door. It’s how you hire, grow and reinvest.

What would you add?

I quit my stable, full-time job to be an entrepreneur—with no backup plan.

It wasn’t glamorous.
It wasn’t strategic.
It was survival.

I was stretched so thin: working all day and building two businesses at night, all while trying to be a good mom, wife, friend, and have even a chance at a social life.

Something had to give.
So I made a choice.
Not because I was ready.

But because staying stuck and exhausted felt worse than risking it all.

When I started thinking about actually taking the leap, I ran through every worst-case scenario:

→ What if I lose clients?

Well, that happened. A couple of months after I quit, my largest client (at the time) took all the work I was doing in-house. 🫠 I knew I could sell and had some money saved.

→ What if I run out of money?

I started cutting expenses. Moved into a fixer-upper duplex as an investment property, downgraded nice things, and lived frugally AF.

→ What if the company fails?

I hoped we could move in with family (I didn’t ask them but, hey! Who can say no to this face? 😇). I could get a job. We could rebuild.


Basically, I made peace with the downside, and that gave me the courage to chase the upside.

Because here’s the truth:
If you can handle the worst…
You free yourself to go after the best.

I hoped we’d thrive, and I KNEW we could survive. That made all the difference.

So if you’re standing at the edge of a big decision—ask yourself this:

What’s the worst that could happen? Can you handle it?


In the words of my all-time favorite musical, RENT:

No day but today.

By that, I mean: careful with my words. Polished and super buttoned up. Always in heels because I thought there was some kind of power dynamic in play (Seriously.) Trying to be something I just wasn’t.

As a young woman leading a company, I didn’t want to say anything wrong, be too casual, or be MYSELF.

Over time, in business, I realized that everyone’s performing a little. They want to sound smart. They’re protecting their turf. They’re trying to say the “right” thing.

But when I started showing up as me—the weird jokes, off-the-cuff comments, a little self-deprecating humor—something shifted.

People relaxed.
They opened up.
They told the truth.

And that’s when the real conversations and real insights happen. In marketing, this is especially important as we are tasked with getting to know audiences and stakeholders in the blink of an eye.

Real conversations can change a messaging strategy or completely redefine a brand.

If you want to get past surface-level answers, you have. to. go. first.
Be imperfect.
Be human.
Be real.

That’s how you disarm people.
When your guard comes down, that’s where the gold is.

And truly, I’ve found that the people that don’t like me as my quirky self… I can live without them. Because we don’t want to be surrounded by people, in our personal lives or in business, who don’t like us for who we are.

I *know* that this is easier said than done.

Tell me, what’s holding you back?

But we let it become our emergency all the time. (Yes, I said LET.)

A client calls at 4 p.m. and needs a deliverable first thing tomorrow.
A coworker delivers critical information that they forgot the day before a deadline.
Your boss says “this shouldn't be too much work” without realizing how long it takes because they don’t understand the nuances of your job.

Sound familiar?

In this week’s episode of my podcast, The Art of Entrepreneurship, I dig into why we keep saying yes to unrealistic asks—and how it hurts us more than we think.

Here’s the kicker:

✨ You get what you accept ✨

When we say yes to crazy timelines, we are training people to believe:
→ that they can call us at 4 p.m. with a project for tomorrow
→ it’s okay if they don’t thoroughly communicate because we’re going to pick up the slack
→ we are going to do whatever our bosses say without setting boundaries because “you’re the boss!”

Unfortunately:

➡️ If you accept rushed timelines, you’ll keep getting rushed timelines.
➡️ If you let chaos dictate your work, you’ll keep living in chaos.

Setting boundaries doesn’t make you look bad or weak. It shows confidence. It shows you care about quality. It shows you value your own time.

And that’s the shift I want you to think about.

I feel like we convince ourselves that if we set better goals, bigger goals, different goals… then every year is going to be different.

Here’s what I’ve learned (the hard way, mostly):
Most goals don’t fail because you lack discipline.
They fail because the systems you have in place are broken. 

Here are some common traps to avoid in the new year:

(1) Relying on motivation instead of structure
(2) Setting outcome-based goals without daily behaviors
(3) Creating massive goal lists that create stress, not progress
(4) Assuming that YOU are the problem, not environment and systems

The biggest lesson I’ve learned over the years is this: real progress comes from consistency, not motivation / intensity.

When your goals are clear and you break them down into tiny pieces and/or daily steps, it becomes so much more simple.

You don’t need a “new you” this year.
You need fewer goals, simple steps, and a system that works ALL the time…not just when you’re at your best.

I go deeper on this in last week’s episode of The Art of Entrepreneurship. Link in the comments!

Early in my career, I worked with one of the most successful entrepreneurs I know. Watching him taught me this:

The people who grow fastest aren’t the ones who try to do everything themselves. They’re the ones who admit their weaknesses and solve for them as fast as possible.


→ He didn’t have a long history in the industry—so he consulted experts and listened more than he talked.

→ He’d led a software company before, but hadn’t scaled a PE-backed company—so he implemented smart processes to ensure cross-functional success.

→ He didn’t know the ins and outs of marketing—so he handed it to us at Accelity and let us run the show. (Cough, just because you see marketing, doesn’t mean you know marketing! 😉)

→ He didn’t have all the answers on how to build a culture—so he leaned on strong leaders around him to build and protect it.

→ He knew he wasn’t super detail-oriented (hello, visionary)—so he brought in operators who could execute consistently while he focused on the big picture.


It was truly a pleasure to watch him make decisions and grow this organization.

Unfortunately, this is where SO many of us get stuck.

You want everything to be perfect. And perfect, in your mind, mostly means done your way. So you keep your hands in everything and make everyone around you ineffective (and unhappy).


Leaders, I challenge you today:

If you really want to level up, stop obsessing over perfection and get brutally honest about what you’re not good at. Then—hand it off.

Because if you’re always the bottleneck, you’re not leading.

Over the past 12 years of building a company, I’ve gained a ton of confidence. A lot of that is thanks to you all.

At the same time, there’s been a little voice in my head whispering things like:

“Who are you to lead a company?”
“Who are you to give advice online?”

And worst of all…

“Can you really do this?”

That’s imposter syndrome. And dang, it hits hard.

Every time I think I’ve conquered it, a new challenge comes a-knockin’. Here’s how I’ve learned to roll with the punches:


𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐜𝐥𝐞.
I know, some people think that “fake it ‘til you make it” is bad advice. I don’t.

Sometimes, you do have to act confident until you feel confident. Remind yourself that you’ve conquered hard situations before, and you’ll do it again. 💪


B𝐞 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐬.
I’m sure plenty of people think I’m confident 110% of the time. I’m not. Spoiler alert: No one is.

Being vulnerable is hard, and doing so in a public forum can be even more of a challenge. But when you find your community—it’s worth it.


J𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠.
I used to panic over tiny presentations. Now I can speak to rooms full of people. I used to worry about every sales presentation. Now they come pretty naturally.

How?

Prepare. Do it scared. Channel your nervous energy. And keep going.

Everyone loves big ideas. Grand plans to disrupt. “We’re gonna be the next Apple/Uber/Airbnb of ______ industry!”

But vision alone doesn’t build a business. *Execution* does.

And while developing vision can be thrilling, execution is often in the unsexy work:

• Building a roadmap and shipping your product accordingly
• Coaching employees through good and bad times
• Following up on sales until you’re blue in the face
• Responding to emails in a timely manner
• Providing feedback even when it’s hard
• Managing financials and paying bills
• Holding your team accountable
• Building repeatable processes
• Hiring and sometimes firing
• And a whole lot more


This is where a lot of founders and leaders fall down. The follow through.

We start companies because we’re dreamers—we see a better way. But somewhere along the line, we start believing that being the visionary is the ultimate compliment.

IMHO: It’s not.

If you want to lead well, this is where I’d start.
 ✅ Shrink your vision into daily actions. Make progress toward your goals every day.
 ✅ Build accountability rhythms: clear expectations, deadlines, and check ins.
 ✅ Stop starting and start finishing. Enlist help as needed (an accountability partner or coach).
 ✅ Measure progress, not just motion. Busy doesn’t always = productive.

I personally need help with systems and accountability and I’m not afraid to admit it. I have systems and people around me that help keep me on track and am very thankful to them. 🙏

Remember this: being honest with yourself is the first step.

Leaders, what’s one way you can improve your working style this week?

Here are the warning signs of a bad customer 👉


Most leaders learn not to sign bad customers the hard way. I definitely did.

When I started Accelity, I thought landing ANY client was a win. If they had a pulse and a budget? Let’s go.

…until I hired clients who made my team cry, blew past budgets, ghosted for weeks, or—my personal favorite—tried to sell our same services to our own clients while still working with us. (True story! 🤣)

Over the years, I’ve learned something I wish someone told me earlier:

There are two types of PITA (Pain In The Ass) clients:
➡️ Good PITAs push for results, stretch the limits of your knowledge, and make you better. (I admit that I am sometimes this kind of client for others)
➡️ Bad PITAs push the boundaries of your contract and make you want to jump off a cliff.

Here’s the trick: learning to spot which one you’re dealing with before you sign the contract.

Here are 6 red flags I look for now (that I used to ignore):

1. Champagne taste, beer budget.

If their expectations and budget don’t line up, it’s not an opportunity to “get scrappy.” It’s a disaster waiting to happen.

2. Ghosting during the sales process.

If they disappear for weeks at a time without responding now, imagine what it’s going to be like getting strategy approval.

3. Talking trash.

If they talk poorly about past vendors, their employees, coworkers… trust me, you’re next.

4. Constantly late or rescheduling.

Busy is normal. We all have a lot going on. But when it tips past the line of disrespect, don’t ignore.

5. Aggressive negotiation.

If they squeeze you hard before they ever even sign the contract, get ready… because it’s gonna get worse after.

6. Nice to power, rude to others.

If they will only speak to people they view as having power or are rude to junior employees, it’s a no for me.

And then there’s the one thing we often undervalue:

✨ Trusting your gut. ✨

If something feels off, it usually is.

If I could give one big piece of advice around this topic, it’s this:

Bad customers cost far more than they pay.

Protect your team. Protect your energy. Protect the business.

Jenny Weeden and I did a talk last last week and we covered this topic many times:

DISTRIBUTE. YOUR. CONTENT.

You spend tons of hours putting together your content, even social content here on LinkedIn.

So why would you only post it one time?

Here are a couple of examples of how I get the most mileage out of my content:

➡️ I record my podcast every week and those topics outline what I talk about on social. And I don't just talk about each episode once! If you haven't noticed already, you'll probably start to see that I link to old episodes in the comments all the time to help people discover the pod.

➡️ I re-post high performing content in different formats, or rewrite the hook for posts that I think should have performed better, then post them again. Especially on LinkedIn lately, there are very few eyeballs seeing your posts.

➡️ At my marketing agency, we are often writing longer pieces of educational content or producing videos, breaking them up into blogs, social posts, videos, podcasts, and more. When those pieces of content become outdated, update, republish.

Promoting and re-promoting content might feel like you’re repeating yourself.

But with so much competition for your audience’s attention, you can’t risk them missing the ONE time you post your content.

**Maybe most importantly, when you don't do this effectively, you're:
   🕓  wasting your time
   💰  wasting your marketing budget

Distribute. Your. Content.

Late nights, early mornings, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead.”

I definitely used to subscribe to this. I tried *everything* to give myself more time in the day to build my business (including the Everyman sleep schedule—look it up. It's insane.).

Turns out, that mindset actually limits your success.

In my latest podcast with Chris Mirabile, the founder & CEO of NOVOS, we talked about the real superpowers of entrepreneurship. Here’s what stuck with me:

You can’t make good decisions, think clearly, or scale effectively when your brain is foggy and your body is running on fumes.

You don’t need to be a biohacker to feel good—you just need to take your mental and physical health seriously. Because your business depends on it.

I saw a graph recently that showed hours of focused work completed during the workday over the last few decades, and it was shocking to see. (Of course I now cannot find this chart… halp?)

Deep work: massively decreased
Task work (pointless meetings, emails, Slacks): taking up most of our days

This is the problem:
We don’t focus at work anymore.

And unfortunately… task work is exactly what is being replaced by AI.

In this interview with Steven Puri, he said “deep work is the only thing LLMs can’t compete with. AI will happily do the filler work. The repetitive work. All day. For nothing.”

So… if you’re asking yourself how to make yourself more valuable, learn how to focus again. Use AI to make your day smarter and more efficient. 

And protect your focus time like your job and your business depend on it… because they do.


PS: if you aren’t connected with Steven Puri, you’re missing out. He went from being a producer on some huge films like The Wolverine and Die Hard to founding The Sukha Company, a focus app for deep work. Plus, he’s just awesome to talk to and learn from!

Many companies still think they can show buyers their logo 7 times, feed them a blog, a couple of demo ads, and BOOM!

They’re ready to buy.

That’s not how it works. (Honestly, was it ever?)

Here’s what really happens:

> They see a post, maybe they give it a thumbs up
> Get retargeted. More posts. More ads.
> Eventually they opt into your email list
> Click on something they intend to read
> It sits buried in tab 47 and they never get to it
> Hear about your brand from a friend and say, “oh yeah! I was going to check them out.”
> Forget again.
> More posts. More emails. More ads.
> Then finally, when THEY’RE ready… they reach out.

This is the messy, nonlinear, self-directed journey that most buyers are taking online today.

So stop trying to shove your buyers through a non-existent funnel.

What should you do instead?
 ✅ Build a library of content that lives on your site (education, self-service tools, proof)
 ✅ Layer in campaigns that meet buyers in the right channel
 ✅ Show up consistently—on social, in search, via email, at events, through PR, wherever your buyers are.

You’re not here to trap your buyers.

You’re here to earn their trust. So when they’re finally ready to pay attention, do some research, take a meeting, and maybe even buy… you’re top of mind.

Hear me out.

You have to establish these things in order to make your price worthwhile:

1. clear ROI
2. the right comparison
3. a sense of urgency

And it’s HARD to establish all of these things especially when your buyer is in a hurry or providing limited time.

That means you probably don’t have a pricing problem. You have a value problem.


Taking the following steps makes all the difference:

> Anchoring to emotional impact
As an agency, we’re not delivering strategy or content. We’re delivering relief for marketers that are doing it all.

> Give context for them to compare to
If you don’t show what your work replaces (a hire, wasted spend, lost time), buyers will compare you to whatever is top of mind for them.

> Tie yourself to real business goals
When your product or service clearly ladders up to revenue, retention, or growth, price becomes easier to justify.


Final PSA: Discounting doesn’t solve this problem! The buyer needs clarity, not just a cheaper price. (You get what you pay for!)

I had a convo recently that presented a different perspective:

AI isn’t going to make you dumb. If you’re choosing not to use it, you are intentionally staying in the minutia.

I’ve talked with a LOT of people about AI over the last few years, especially on my podcast The Art of Entrepreneurship. And Alex Mehr, Ph.D. is probably the biggest AI optimist I’ve met so far.

He said:
We aren’t overusing AI, we’re underusing it. Grinding through work we simply shouldn’t be doing anymore. Manually researching, drafting, summarizing, note taking, and doing work that a machine can do in 8 seconds.

Then we all claim we don’t have time to think. 🫠

I’ve heard plenty of people say that they feel they should practice skills they’re sourcing to AI so they don’t lose them.

And maybe that will need to happen at some point.

But right now? Per Alex, the bigger risk isn’t skill atrophy. It’s irrelevance in an AI-driven world.

This episode definitely made me think. What’s your reaction??

Here’s the truth: people don’t think or talk like this in real life.

On this week’s episode of The Art of Entrepreneurship, I talked to Holland Martini and Maria Vorovich, co-founders of GOODQUES, about what good research actually looks like.

Their answers can teach new, creative angles to even the best researchers:

➡️ Skip the canned survey. If you’re going to use surveys as part of your research, they should be thoughtful and humanized every single time.

➡️ Give your interviewee a perspective. One of their favorite questions is “write a eulogy for this product” (vs. how would you feel if X product went away?)

➡️ Think about how you make people feel while they engage with you. At Accelity, we always want people to feel like they’re having fun during stakeholder interviews with us. (Unheard of!)

I’ve seen this play out too many tim,"Marketing is the only business function where people expect instant results—and marketers are partially to blame. I’ve seen this play out too many times:

→ Company hires a marketing agency
→ Company expects immediate ROI
→ The agency, afraid to lose the deal, promises those results
→ Marketing team scrambles, throws tactics at the wall
→ Results don’t come fast enough
→ Both sides walk away frustrated

Who’s at fault? Frankly, it’s both parties.

👉 The company, for expecting what’s not possible.
👉 The agency, for not setting boundaries and saying “this isn’t realistic.”

Because let’s be honest—what new hire, in any department, delivers immediate results? Sales? Finance? Product? No one does. Marketing is no different.


That’s why I recently said no to a prospect who wanted “instant results” without strategy or investment. I knew how the story would end.

Listen, I get it. There are bad actors in this industry, and many companies feel like they’ve been burned before. But accountability exists on both sides.


Here’s my two cents on how we can change this cycle:

1️⃣ Put a vetting process in place. Do the work up front so you can actually trust the resource you hire.

2️⃣ Choose your references (this strategy is from the book Who by Geoff Smart.) As names come up during sales conversations, jot them down. Ask to speak with those people, not just the ones the agency/hire handpicks.

3️⃣ Clearly define success. For the first 90 days, define milestones and deliverables that both sides agree on.

4️⃣ Stop changing your mind. Marketing isn’t built on whims. It’s built on long-term, consistent effort. If you’ve vetted and hired well, let them run.


Agencies: set boundaries.
Companies: set realistic expectations.

That’s the biggest lesson I learned from my guests on The Art of Entrepreneurship in 2025.

When you’re 300-some episodes in, interviews hit different. My guests last year were raw, fun, insightful, and packed with the kind of lessons you only get from people who’ve actually *done the things.* (My favorite kind of people. :))

Here are the themes that kept showing up:


(1) 𝐈𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐬 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐞𝐫; 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫.

Suneera Madhani reminded me that growing personally and/or a business with ease is a myth, but progress is real. Your capacity to do awesome things expands with every single step you take.


(2) 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐬𝐧’𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐜, 𝐢𝐭’𝐬 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬.

Lior Weinstein broke down how he makes growth inevitable for himself and his companies through experiments, discipline and removing constraints. Not vibes. Not guessing. Systems.


(3) 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 + 𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭.

Patrick Thean said “no great leader exists without empathy” and I truly have not stopped thinking about it since. EQ is a superpower.


(4) 𝐀𝐥𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐛𝐞 “𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐩 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲.”

Ilana Golan helped me rethink how opportunity actually works. Remember this: your next break comes from the people who think of you when you’re not in the room.


(5) 𝐌𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬.

Michael Ray said that anyone can show up for launch day or for a point in time. The real work is staying relevant long after hype fades.


(6) 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐬𝐞.

Abby Bruckner and Michelle Bickert Breen drilled this home: know your why. Before you change, deeply understand the reasons and what your market is saying. Alignment > aesthetics.


This roundup episode is one of my favorites every year because it shows what entrepreneurship, leadership, and personal development really look like. The grit, the growth, the mindset shifts, and what it really takes to achieve them.

If you’ve been building, rebuilding, or questioning your next step this year… this one’s for you!

Here’s what I mean:
I talk to teams spending tens of thousands a month on ads—and when I ask if they're reaching their goals (their goal is usually to generate leads), the answer is a resounding NO.

Because ads don’t fix your broken website.

They amplify misaligned messaging, confusing navigation, poor UX, and vague calls to action.

If your website isn’t built to convert, every dollar you spend driving buyers there is a waste.

Most companies don’t need a new campaign. They need to fix the experience buyers already have. I wrote about what that means (and how to do it) in this article. 👇",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thejackiehermes_most-marketers-dont-have-a-lead-gen-problem-activity-7396992440194461696-cHVO?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABV2-5cBS3OuBNwTYEDjt2OGEtA-PUnnrNs

But does it have to?

I used to think so... but I don't anymore.

Now, I’d argue that being “all in” can sometimes hold you back.

When you live and breathe only your business:
→ It's harder to find joy in the day-to-day work.
→ It's easy to lose perspective and have a one-track mind.
→ You risk building something that reflects your tunnel vision, not the bigger picture.

That’s why I was so intrigued to talk with Michael Fabiano on my podcast this week. He’s not only an entrepreneur—he’s also an instrument-rated pilot, an acclaimed opera singer, and a nonprofit founder.

From the outside, it looks *impossible* to juggle all of that. (Seriously. How?!)

But Michael explained that each of those “lanes” sharpens his perspective as a leader.
→ Flying requires focus and precision.
→ Opera taught him how to perform under pressure.
→ Running a nonprofit gives him people-first leadership skills.

And he brings all of those skills to entrepreneurship.

This is the point: passions aren’t distractions.

They keep you sharp, inspired, and capable of building something that lasts.

Why? Because the traits that make our everyday lives feel challenging are often the ones that make us incredible entrepreneurs. Go figure. 🤪

Here’s what I mean:

Creativity → Chaos: we have nonstop ideas, but it’s hard to prioritize or finish.

Hyperfocus → Tunnel vision: we can make massive progress, but everything else falls away.

High energy → Burnout: we’re unstoppable on Friday, but crashing out by Monday.

Risk-taking → Impulsiveness: big swings can fuel growth or create very costly mistakes.

Empathy → Overextension: we’re great at building loyalty but suck at boundaries.

Flexibility → Inconsistency: we can pivot fast, but sometimes have shiny object syndrome.

Curiosity → Distraction: we’re interested in everything and we can easily lose focus.

This can be *especially* true for those founders with ADHD, which studies show is somewhere between 15-30% of us.


This week on The Art of Entrepreneurship, I sat down with Skye Waterson, founder of Unconventional Organisation, to talk about how to:
👉 Harness ADHD strengths in business
👉 Recognize and manage your shadow sides
👉 Build systems that work with your brain, not against it


If you’ve ever felt like your greatest strength was also your biggest struggle, you’re not alone. (Same. Same.)

(And ar","8 ways to rethink your marketing and sales strategies:

1️⃣ Abandon your assumptions

Be honest: what are you making ""educated guesses"" about? (And are your guesses really that educated?) Talk to your customers. Find out what they really care about.

2️⃣ Incentivize the right team behaviors

If your sales and marketing teams are evaluated by vanity metrics, like MQLs or leads regardless of quality—you’re getting it wrong.

3️⃣ Reevaluate what’s working

Please! Don't continue a strategy forever just because you’ve invested time or money. Is it working? If not, how can you change it? If you’ve tested it thoroughly, reallocate that budget.

4️⃣ Don't be a hero

Stop volunteering to take things on when you don’t have bandwidth. Stop overpromising and under-delivering. Your sales and marketing teams must work together in order to succeed.

5️⃣ Revisit old activities to see what can be used again

In time, everything old becomes new again (as evidenced by this new Hollister 2000's line... huh? I can't.). Can you run a lost opps campaign? Turn back on a high-performing ad campaign while you cook up the next strategy? You don’t have to start from scratch every time.

6️⃣ Time bound your goals and hold each other accountable

Dang, do some companies move slow. I fully believe this is because of a lack of accountability. Consistent feedback and accountability systems that hold everyone to their word are the name of the game.

7️⃣ Don’t be afraid to completely abandon channels

Repeat after me: you don’t have to be active in every social channel. If your customers and prospects aren’t there, ditch it. And some, you might just want to ditch anyway. (Cough, X.)

8️⃣ Make sure your goals align directly to the results you’re looking to achieve

Last but not least: it’s easy to set goals that sound good. It’s hard to execute on them long-term and ensure they have big business impact. Your goals should be SMART and directly tied to the goals of the company and the departments around you. How are you really moving the needle?

Thats not a knock on your company! it’s just reality… no one cares about your company until they start to know and trust you.

Then you layer on this lesson from PR expert KJ Blattenbauer and it gets even more interesting: Press isn’t as much about YOU as it is about TIMING.

You can have:
 • a great story
 • an awesome win
 • a legit business
…and still not be newsworthy right now.

What actually gets media attention is relevance.

Ask yourself:
What’s happening in the world?
What problem are they already thinking about?
What’s top-of-mind for my audience/prospects this month?

There is a huge difference between announcements (“here’s what we’re up to at ABC corp!”) and what matters to your audience today.


In this week’s podcast episode, I talked with KJ about what actually makes a story pressworthy.

She expands on this simple framework:
 • who you are
 • what you do
 • why it matters right now

If you’re pitching stories that start and end with your business… this might change how you think about getting press. 😇

Here’s the problem: many leaders take the thinking away from their teams.

They overload them with tasks.
They expect constant output.
And without realizing it, they train people to “just do” instead of empowering them to think.

Patrick Thean said it best in our conversation:

You have to create the habit of thinking, dedicate actual time to it—and encourage others to do the same.

That idea, which he calls time partitioning, forces you to slow down, sit with the problem, and actually let your brain process it.

It’s uncomfortable at first. But if we don’t create space for thinking, we’re just running harder on the hamster wheel.

And I think we all know that busy doesn’t always = productive.

A little food for thought on your Friday morning.


In this week’s episode of The Art of Entrepreneurship with Patrick Thean, Co-Founder of Rhythm Systems, we dig into:
→ What differentiates the most successful leaders
→ The lessons he’s learned working with high performing leaders
→ Daily rhythms and practices that help build strong, successful teams

If your leadership team is still using attribution to “prove the value,” of marketing, you were set up to fail in the first place.

Here’s why:

Sure, a lot of marketing and sales data is attributable, but real influence isn’t. Let me know when you figure out how to track:
- Word of mouth, referrals
- Personal relationships, reputation
- Texts, Slacks, DMs (heck, I’ve recommended my favorite products via these channels multiple times *just this week*)

Yes, attribution still has its place in marketing… but it should be used for strategy, not politics.

Use attribution metrics to understand:
✔️ Which paths are converting the best leads
✔️ What types of content are most compelling to buyers
✔️ Where to double down and where to pull back on budget

If your marketing and sales teams are at odds, you’ve already lost.

Build an attribution model that helps your go-to-market team make better decisions—together.

So many of us grew up believing:

Success = sacrifice

Money = struggle

Achievement = exhaustion

We’re literally praised for how *hard* we work. (I am still guilty of this sometimes!)
Not how intentional we are or how smart we work.

Here’s the truth that Dr. Darnyelle Jervey Harmon breaks down during our podcast together:

Of course success requires effort. Achieving goals never has been, and never will be easy. But it does NOT require:

Sacrificing mental / physical health
Ignoring important relationships
Constantly proving your worth
Working nights and weekends
Being disciplined at all times
Dealing with chronic stress
Saying yes to everything
Pretending you’re “fine”
Missing family events
Waking up at 4 am
Doing it all alone
Micromanaging
Perfectionism
Husting 24/7
Suffering
Burnout

I could go on.

We have to start getting skeptical of anyone that says these things are necessary, because they’re simply not. Both Dr. Darnyelle and I are testaments to that.

If you’ve been operating from survival mode… this episode will shift something in you. Truly, our conversation made my day and changed my mindset.

But here’s the truth about video and personal brands in general: Your buyer,"Most leaders still hesitate to show up on video. And trust me… I get it.


But here’s the truth about video and personal brands in general:
Your buyers want to SEE you. The want to KNOW you.

Not the polished brochure version of you. The real you.

I asked Richard Turgeon, creative director and head of brand at AtlasFX, what he says to leaders who avoid video:

“9 out of 10 people want more video from their brands. I see it almost as a requirement.”

He’s spot on. 💯 Video isn’t a “nice-to-have” anymore…. it’s your fastest path to trust online.

Here’s why:

→ Video is a hugely preferred content format. HubSpot reports 9/10 consumers want more video from brands.

→ It humanizes your company. Faces build trust. Your customers want to know the people behind the products and services they’re buying.

→ It increases conversion. Landing pages with video can increase conversion rates by 80%+. [also HubSpot]

If they’re like me, your leaders might also be worried about skill level. (TBH, that’s valid. They’re not going to be perfect off the bat—I wasn't my any means.)

But like Rich said during our conversation: imperfect actually helps sell. And you can only gain the skills by showing up.


So if your leadership is hesitant, show them these stats. Tell them it’s time to show up anyway. 😉 Your audience is asking for it.

I see this all the time:

""I have an idea but I need a business plan""
""I have an idea but I need to go raise money""
""I have an idea but I need a team in order to build""

IMO, none of this true. Get scrappy. Build with the tools available to you. Run the Sprint process (shoutout John Zeratsky & Jake Knapp!) and build and test a prototype in short order. Start with an MVP. Get to revenue. Go from there.

You don’t need everything to be perfect to start. By the time you do, it might be too late.

In my latest podcast of The Art of Entrepreneurship, Safeer Qureshi and I discussed one of his mantras:

“Simplify until it hurts.”

Make it SO simple that anyone can understand.

Not until it sounds smart.
Not until it looks impressive.
Until you* actually* understand it.

There’s so much gold in this episode. We discussed what happens when you strip away the noise, ignore the “smart” advice, and focus on what actually moves the business forward.

It doesn’t happen in the spotlight. It happens in the quiet moments with no map, no mentor and no one ahead of you showing the way.

At some point, every trailblazer faces the same crossroads: keep pushing alone, or reach out for support.

That’s when you realize—asking for help isn’t weakness. It’s strategy.

That’s what I took away from my conversation with Ilana Golan.

From the Israeli Air Force to Silicon Valley, Ilana kept leaping into rooms where she didn’t see anyone who looked like her. 

She kept moving forward anyway.

Today, she’s built Leap Academy to give others what she wished she’d had: guidance, clarity and a way to design a *portfolio career* that actually multiplies your opportunities.

Her story reminded me:

→ Independence is powerful, but connection gets you further.

→ Confidence grows faster when you stop trying to earn it alone.

→ The biggest expense in your career isn’t what you spend, it’s what you leave on the table.

If you’ve ever downplayed your potential because you didn’t know what was possible, this conversation will change how you see your own path.

I talked to a CEO of a growing tech company recently. He said:

“My marketing team seems to be doing well, but they only set goals around marketing metrics and won’t take ownership over anything having to do with the pipeline.”

Marketers, this is a mistake. 😬

Here’s why:


1️⃣

Setting goals around pipeline and revenue encourages all the right behavior from the marketing team:

↳ Talking to prospects and customers to understand what they really care about so we’re always up to date on industry issues and hot topics (vs. staying in ur marketing caves and telling stories from 5 years ago).

↳ Creating smart, relevant content to educate and help (vs. bashing them over the head with demo ads).	

↳ Helping engage prospects through the sales process (vs. handing off leads and washing our hands of further responsibility).

↳ Measuring conversion beyond what marketing “owns” (vs. only measuring the leading indicators of success like traffic, clicks, followers, etc.)


2️⃣

Pipeline impact is a marketing metric.

And if it isn’t at your company, tell your CEO that it should be.

Measuring marketing-impacted and marketing-generated pipeline eradicates the bad behavior that marketers sometimes HAVE to engage in to meet their goals.

*Cough, shoving MQLs through to sales that may or may not be a fit, cough*

What CEO doesn’t want marketing spending more time on revenue generation and less time on busy work?


3️⃣

Last but not least…

As a marketer, taking ownership over pipeline and revenue makes you indispensable.

It helps you prove your value, get in good with the C-suite, move up in a company, and a lot more.

Sounds like every marketer’s dream. 😇

And if the foundation is weak, ads just spotlight the cracks.

Before you invest in paid campaigns, look at your website and ask yourself:
✔️ Is my site skimmable?
✔️ Are the headlines clear > clever?
✔️ Is jargon reduced as much as possible?
✔️ Do visitors know what to expect when they click?
✔️ Are you providing enough info for buyers to educate themselves?
*remember, 70%+ of the buying process happens before sales ever gets involved

If not, start there—otherwise, you’re lighting that ad budget on fire.

Marketers: how are you solving the “we need leads asap” challenge? I know this is a common pain for companies everywhere.

It’s not easy to disappoint people, set boundaries, or make decisions that you know others won’t agree with. But sometimes, it’s necessary.

She shows up fully at work, fully at home, and doesn’t take roles that demand she sacrifice one for the other.

Flexibility isn’t a perk. It’s the baseline. And it’s time more companies got that.

I’ve seen so many companies:
 → Immediately present demo ads
 → Boost posts in lieu of strategic campaigns
 → Target the wrong audiences, get false signals
 → Launch a campaign, forget to monitor performance
 → Send potential buyers to poorly optimized web pages

...then wonder why nothing’s converting.

If you don’t understand how your buyers behave on this platform—and if your offer isn’t actually valuable to them—you’re just paying for impressions.

Marketers still miss the fact that the secret to standing out has. not. changed.

Write for humans.

If your content sounds like it was produced in a factory, neither your audience nor AI will reward it. 

But when it feels real—when it answers *actual* questions, sounds like a person, and builds trust—it pulls double duty:
 
It connects with your audience
+
 It gets recognized and elevated by AI

AI is changing how content is created and discovered. The brands that win will be the ones that still speak like a human.

Most teams jump straight to tactics: more content, more leads, new channels.
But here’s what I usually see behind the scenes 👀👇

❌ No clear positioning

If you can’t clearly answer *who* this is for and *why*, your marketing will always feel noisy.

❌ Sales + marketing misalignment

If sales says the leads “aren’t good” and marketing says “we’re doing our job,” that’s not a lead problem (it’s a definition problem).

❌ Too many decision-makers

Collaboration matters, but without clear ownership, messaging can get diluted. Defining who decides helps teams move with confidence (and keeps the momentum going!).

❌ Constantly shifting priorities

When goals change month to month, marketing never has the chance to compound or perform.

🚨 Hard truth alert: Marketing won’t fix operational chaos. If anything, it will amplify it.

Before changing tactics, ask yourself:

🤔 Do we actually know who we’re for?

🤔 Are sales and marketing solving the same problem?

🤔 Is there a clear owner who can make decisions and move things forward?

Get that right, and marketing starts working a whole lot better.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jennifernweeden_if-your-marketing-isnt-working-id-bet-activity-7430257375733002240-dzou?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB0q1vsBp4hULNTjGJX-vWVJ4DU-a38UXeY

Every year at our annual onsite, we run a client journey exercise where we put ourselves directly in their shoes: from first touchpoint >> kickoff >> ongoing campaigns. (The first year was run by Vanaya G., who gave us this awesome framework!!)

We question, challenge, and poke holes in the experience we deliver.

It’s always a little eye-opening. 👀 And it helps us speak candidly about the friction we’re experiencing.

This year we uncovered gaps in communication, and we saw opportunities to simplify, clarify, and surprise and delight at every stage. 🥳

I love this exercise. That’s because I LOVE hearing directly from team Accelity, the people who work IN the business, as they work ON the business.

It helps us…

✔️ Challenge our assumptions about what’s “easy” or “clear.”

✔️ Build empathy for what clients are feeling at each stage.

✔️ Strengthen our process so the client experience keeps getting better.

The result? A sharper process and a stronger team. When you see your work from the client’s perspective, it changes how you show up.

Too many small teams think social media means being on 6 platforms at once.

Start with what you can maintain… and ignore the rest.

Your audience does. not. care. if you exist on every platform. They care if you show up well where THEY spend time.

Here’s what lean teams should ask:

1️⃣ Where is your audience actually active?

2️⃣ What platforms can your team realistically manage well?

3️⃣ What’s the goal of being on that platform? (Awareness? Engagement? Lead gen?)

4️⃣ Does your messaging work in the format the platform demands?

Social is only overwhelming when you try to do it all. Start with one platform, nail it, then expand.

We run a client journey walkthrough, start to finish, at Accelity’s annual onsite. 
From first interaction >> kickoff >> ongoing work. All of it.

We don’t sugarcoat the conversation.

Instead, we slow down, ask hard questions, and look for the spots where things feel confusing, clunky or heavier than they need to be. 😓

And every year… something clicks. 👀

This time around, we noticed where communication could be tighter, where expectations could be clearer, and where we had real opportunities to simplify and create moments that feel genuinely thoughtful (and even fun). 🥳

This is hands-down one of my favorite exercises.

It centers the voices of the people actually doing the work. Team Accelity gets to step out of execution mode and work ON the business, not just IN it.

What it gives us:

✔️ A reality check on what we assume is “obvious”

✔️ Deeper empathy for how clients feel at each stage

✔️ Stronger, more intentional processes that keep evolving

The outcome is always the same: better systems, better conversations, and a better experience on both sides.

Marketing is evolving fast. We don’t chase every shiny object at Accelity, buuuut we are paying close attention to the shifts that are changing how people connect with brands.

Here’s where I’d place my bets:

👯 1. Creator-driven content over brand-polished campaigns
 
People crave realness. Content that looks like it was made by a person performs better than the most polished brand assets. We’re leaning into user-generated content (UGC) and creators highlighting the human side of business (like Jackie Hermes, Dave Hersh, & Chris Heard).

🧠 2. Strategy > Speed

 The days of “just post more” are over 👋 . What’s working now: slowing down to build brand depth and intention before layering on volume. Think about the content you have and how that can be repurposed instead of watering down your messages with similar, less powerful content. Our most successful campaigns are anchored in clarity, not juuust consistency. 

💬 3. Conversation-led marketing

From social DMs to email replies, the best marketing today doesn’t broadcast—it invites responses. The brands winning right now are those that know how to listen just as well as they write and create a space for their followers to sound off.


🚫 And the one trend I’m ignoring:

🤖  AI-generated eVeRtHiNg.

Yes, MANY of us use AI, but handing over your brand voice to machines? Haha... nah. 

Audiences can *feel* the difference between lazy automation and intentional messaging. AI is a tool, not a substitute for strategic thinking or a creative soul.

The future of marketing isn’t louder: it’s smarter, more human & more connected.

I’m so thankful for every piece of hard feedback we’ve gotten as Accelity leadership.

I just re-read the feedback our team has shared this year. The good, the bad, the uncomfortable.

Whenever I revisit feedback, it reminds me of HOW FAR we’ve come together. 🥹

The truth is, gratitude in leadership isn’t about saying “thanks” when things go right. It’s about appreciating the people who stay through the messy middle (thank goodness for them!).

These are the team members who:

🗣️ Speak up when it’s hard.

💯 Trust you enough to tell you the truth.

🤝 Show up, not just for the work, but for each other.

This year, I’m thankful for a team that:

 💬 Gives feedback with honesty and care

 💪 Takes ownership without ego

 🌱 Keeps growing even when it’s uncomfortable

Leading them has been one of the greatest privileges of my life.

So before we all log off for turkey, naps, and family chaos this week, here’s my reminder to all leaders: Don’t just count your wins. Count your people.

They’re the reason the wins exist in the first place. 🩷💛

🔹 What changed in our team?

🔹 What changed in how we lead?

Here’s what I’ve realized: you don’t build momentum by doing more.

You build it by doing the *right* things consistently. 🔁

So as we head into 2026, this is what I’m carrying forward:

🤝 Trust first.

Our best work happens when our team feels psychologically safe, and free to do their best work.

⚙️ Systems second.

Systems are about creating the ability to focus on what matters (it's not about control!).

💜 People always.

The strategy, goals & growth we have seen all depend on the humans behind it. (And we have some pretty great humans on team Accelity.)

I don’t like to set a lot of resolutions, but this year I have just one: keep building in a way that makes us proud.

Our first survey years ago? Rough. The feedback was overwhelming, and honestly, a little hard to hear. But it was also exactly what we needed to build the culture we wanted.

Fast forward to today: this year’s survey was one of our best yet. The team shared what they love most about Accelity:

 ✨ Our talented, creative & authentic people

 ✨ Our culture

 ✨ Flexibility

 ✨ Growth opportunities

 ✨ The support they feel from Accelity

The critical feedback? Much less overwhelming than in the past—and delivered with the same kindness and thoughtfulness that defines our team. 🤗

Running this survey every year makes us better leaders, a stronger team, and a happier place to work.

I’ve learned they’re accelerators. ⏩

Early in my career, mistakes made me defensive. My ego wanted to protect me, but all that did was slow my growth.

When I shifted my mindset, everything changed:

🤝 Owning the mistake built trust with my team faster than pretending it didn’t happen.

🔍 Analyzing it without blame gave us better processes (like the QA checks we now swear by).

💬 Sharing it openly created psychological safety—if I can admit I got it wrong, my team can too.

Some of Accelity’s biggest culture and business wins have come from cleaning up mistakes:

➕ A survey result that stung >> reshaped how we lead.

➕ A botched email send >> rebuilt our QA process.

➕ Early hiring missteps >> new data-driven hiring practices.

There was a time in our business when people didn’t feel heard. They didn’t feel safe giving feedback. They didn’t fully trust leadership (which meant they didn’t fully trust me).

That was the turning point.

🚨  Culture doesn’t break overnight. It cracks slowly, in the spaces where honesty isn’t safe. 

When we began getting team feedback, we started small:

👂 We listened instead of defending.

🧭 We shared themes of team feedback openly with the whole team.

🪞 We owned our mistakes before asking others to own theirs.

Little by little, trust started to rebuild. 🌱

Now?

🥳 People tell us the hard stuff directly.

🥳 We have an average employee retention rate of 5 years (double the typical agency employee’s tenure).

🥳 And our team surveys show 100% of employees rating us 9 or above.

This is how we know we’re doing something right.

Psychological safety isn’t built by being perfect. It’s built by being *real*.

If your team isn’t giving you tough feedback, don’t assume everything’s fine. They might just not feel safe enough to say it.

We’ve been there.

And it cost us time, money, and, most importantly, trust. 😕 

A few years ago at Accelity  we realized our hiring process wasn’t working. We’d bring on someone based on potential, instinct, or what we thought we might need in the future.

The problem?

Sometimes we hired too early and didn’t have enough work to support that person.

Other times, we waited too long and stretched our existing team too thin.
Both situations created stress. And both were *avoidable*.

So we got honest. And specific.

Here’s what we changed:

🔢 We calculated actual workload.

We looked at billable hours by role and determined what a full-time plate should look like. That became our new baseline for hiring.

📊 We tied hiring to real numbers.

When teams were consistently hitting or exceeding their billable targets and we saw work piling up, that’s when we started looking for the next hire, not before.

🧠 We trained the team on the why.

We wanted everyone to understand how staffing decisions are made. It built trust and helped team members feel empowered to speak up when they were over capacity.

⚖️ We created roles based on what was actually needed.

Not every new hire needs to be a unicorn. Sometimes you need a specialist, sometimes a generalist. But you won’t know unless you really assess the gaps.
That shift—from gut to grounded—has helped us hire smarter, retain longer & protect our culture.

...because hiring isn’t about filling a seat. It’s about creating the right fit for the team you have and the work ahead.

In reality, this isn’t a punishment; it creates clear transparency. 🔍

Some people haaaate the word accountability (admittedly, early in my career, it wasn’t my favorite concept).

It can sound a little like being called to the principal’s office. 😬

So, early in my leadership career, I tended towards too much empathy and not enough accountability. I wanted people to like me, not fear me. I didn’t hold myself accountable to leading as well as I could either.

But guess what happens when a leader avoids accountability?

🙀 Confusion.

🙀Frustration.

🙀And eventually… burnout for everyone.

Without accountability, your best people end up cleaning up the messes of the ones who aren’t held to the same standards.

And that’s not fair leadership. It also leads to terrible employee retention rates.
Ready for a reframe? Accountability is about creating clarity (not catching people’s mistakes).

Set:

 ✅ Clear goals

 ✅ Clear expectations

 ✅ Clear ownership

Now, when something goes off-track, we talk about it openly. No blame. No shame. Everyone shows up and owns their part to determine how we fix the problem *together*.

That’s what real accountability looks like. Fairness > Fear.

It’s amazing how much stronger a team becomes when everyone knows where they stand and what’s expected.

Accountability is the promise to our teams that we CARE enough about them and the work to help everyone succeed. 💪

Spoiler: that version of leadership doesn’t exist. 👀

If you’re trying to create perfection in your leadership, you’re really just creating distance between you and your team.

When I started leading openly, leading with vulnerability, things started changing.

I started saying things like:

🔹 “I don’t know, but I’ll find out.”

🔹“I made the wrong call there.”

🔹“I need a minute before I respond.”

And you know what happened? The team leaned in.

🔸 They stopped trying to be flawless, too.

🔸They started bringing real problems, not polished ones.

🔸We started solving more, hiding less.

In a recent podcast conversation with Bradley Foley, we talked about my path from...

Corporate sales & marketing
>>
Agency life 
>> 
Becoming President and Partner at Accelity

What stood out to me most was how much of that growth came from letting go of the day-to-day and stepping into strategy & operations.

One of the biggest turning points for us was embracing transparency (like, really embracing it 🤗). When we introduced systems that gave our employees space to share, the results helped us step into growth and the honest culture we’d been trying to build.

Building something sustainable isn’t about hacks or heroics. We’ve got to stay consistent & accountable… and be willing to evolve.

(This came up in my drafts again and felt worth resharing.)

Here’s an example of what this looked like for me and my super greens drink powder journey:

🌱 2 years ago, I heard an in-podcast ad about a super greens drink supplement.

🌱 I researched and was not convinced that I should buy based on the price.

🌱 I put the supplement I wanted to buy in my shopping cart on the site, then abandoned it.

🌱 Ads on ads hit my social platforms (especially Instagram).

🌱 A year ago, my business partner, Jackie, shared that she takes a super greens drink supplement.

🌱 I looked at the website. I was then served supergreens drink options through social media ads.

🌱 6 months ago, a co-worker shared she takes a greens drink supplement. I did more research.

🌱 I abandoned another shopping cart.

🌱 MORE ADS! 🙃

😴 A couple of months ago, I began feeling the 2 PM slump a lot harder than usual. It felt like I had a weight on my chest.

🌱 I talked to my business partner about which supplement she uses; she told me.

🌱 I researched again, this time even more in-depth, comparing several options. (Spoiler alert… more ads came my way.)

💰Within a week of talking to my business partner, I purchased.


My problem, NOT the message, was the impetus for buying. 

HOWEVER… the marketing messages I saw along the way, word of mouth, my subsequent research AND the ads I received pushed me to purchase. 💳

I nearly purchased several times. 

It became the *right* time to purchase when I felt that my PAIN, the symptom of my problem, needed to be addressed. The marketing messages I received each time informed my path to purchase and made it easier for me to click “Buy now” when I was ready.

That’s how buyers buy. Not on our timelines, but on theirs.

After 10+ years working with CMOs and Marketing Managers, I’ve seen it time and time again that it’s practically part of their job. 😅

But why does it have to be?

💳 Because marketing is still viewed as a cost center, not a revenue driver.

🫥 Because many leaders don’t understand how to measure marketing’s impact.

🤝 Because “just trust us” doesn’t cut it when budgets are tight.

❓ Because marketing ROI isn’t always immediate—or obvious.

🪑 Because too often, marketers haven’t been given a seat at the strategy table.

It does NOT have to be this way. 🎉

When marketing is aligned with business goals, speaks the language of revenue, and consistently proves its value, the begging stops.

Don’t let anyone’s *bullshit opinions* about what you can’t do especially your own stop you from following your dreams. 😏💥

When I was 23, I decided I wanted to be a life coach. And yes… this was way before that was a thing.

Back then, “life coach” sounded about as legit as dream farmer or potato doctor. 🥔😂

Who would hire a 23-year-old life coach?

If your offer feels hard to explain, your audience feels unsure how to buy.😬 And when people feel unsure, they hesitate.

So you keep tweaking captions. Posting more. Waiting. And nothing changes.

Here’s the truth 👇
Most entrepreneurs are one clear, profitable offer away from real momentum. They just don’t know how to build it or validate it without months of overthinking.

That’s why I created the $250K Offer App.✨

In one guided experience, you go from idea overload 🤯 to one clear, validated offer, plus the sales page and 7 emails to actually sell it. 

No guessing. No duct-taped launches. No spending months making $0 while you “figure it out.” 🙅‍♀️

It’s okay to want more—more time freedom, more location freedom, more creative freedom.

It’s okay to want more MONEY. (PSA: Wanting money doesn’t make you greedy, selfish, or bad. It makes you human.)

It’s okay to want more joy, more fulfillment, more deep, soul-shaking friendships.

It’s okay to want a better world—more justice, more equity, more opportunities for everyone.

Truth is? You’ve probably been conditioned to settle for less. To feel guilty for wanting more. To think, “Shouldn’t I just be grateful? Is it really okay to dream this big?”

YES, IT IS.

🔥 Wanting more doesn’t mean you’re ungrateful. You can be wildly ambitious and deeply appreciative at the same time.

🔥 More success for YOU doesn’t take away from anyone else. In fact, the more you own, activate, and celebrate your dreams, the more you inspire others to do the same.

So here’s your permission slip:
✨ Be proud of your ambition.
✨ Own your desires.
✨ Burn the myth that you’re “too much.”

“I don’t hate what I built…but it doesn’t fit the way it used to.”

That’s a strange place to stand. Because from the outside? Everything can look successful. Stable. “Working.” But inside… something’s shifting.

Here’s what I know: Outgrowing something isn’t a failure. It’s growth. And growth almost always feels messy before it feels clear. 🪴

You don’t have to blow up your whole life. You don’t need a dramatic reinvention. Sometimes you just need structure while you evolve. Support while you experiment. A smart way to test what’s next.

That’s one of the reasons I built B-School the way I did. Not just for the first idea.
But for every pivot after that.

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-03-16T21:43:47.714Z,1137,135,12,image,"My sister and I didn't speak for nearly 3 years.

Next weekend, she's coming to visit.

As I instinctively reacted YES to her message about a stay at my house... it dawned on me.

I'm not afraid anymore.

For a very long time, I was too triggered to hang out w/ family. 

I couldn't bare the pain of her not validating my childhood experience. I was in a constant state of frustration tryin to get her to see things my way.

I couldn't appreciate her for who she is, or where she's uniquely at on her journey.

Over the years reconnecting, we've found common ground. And while we still don't see eye-to-eye on everything...

there's mutual respect.

The arguments and name calling turned into civil disagreements.
The civil disagreements turned into opportunities for bonding.

new levels of safety, for both her and I. 

I now realize THIS IS us breaking generational cycles, rather than falling victim to the patterns of separation that plagued so many before. (I guess that's the stubbornness of the Irish for ya...)

So, when I heard her childlike energy through the phone as she shared how excited she is to book a trip to come see me... I had a moment of reflection on how far I've come that instead of my usual knee-jerk reaction to shut her out, anticipating unnecessary drama and a ""I'd just rather not deal with this"" attitude...

I instead just smiled and of course told her,

YES!

Actually, I'm excited too! :) 

and damn that's a whole lotta growth.

Not to mention - it was a good excuse for me to finally clean out my guest room which has basically been used as storage unit since I moved back in November.

It's been FB Marketplace ads all weekend over here.

I was removing the top mattress that I once also had on this bed, when I noticed cat urine!

Ugh.

I decided to list anyways (for free), w/ a disclaimer about the cat pee... but if you want to come pick it up, it is yours.

A woman showed up in a beat up car w/ her husband & kids, incredibly grateful for a free, cat-pissed mattress.

𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘴𝘬...

Her situation seemed low. And she opened up to me about how she recently lost her oldest daughter and ended up homeless. She finally got herself an efficiency and they had no furniture yet.

I ended up giving her more items and asked, ""What else do you need? Seriously, ask me anything!""

""I know this is strange but, do you have laundry detergent?""

I go inside and grab her a full, unopened bottle. The look on her daughters face as she saw me, ""Mommy! we can finally do laundry!""

My heart almost broke.

I could feel the pain in this woman's soul over her daughter's death. Trying with all her might to keep going for the sake of her other children. It was a humble reminder of not only how blessed I, you, and probably everyone on LI reading this actually are...

but of how short life is, and how quickly family... can be gone.

Grateful for my life, 
for my blessings, 
for my growth.

Grateful to, again soon... 

be hanging out with my sister. ♥️",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_my-sister-and-i-didnt-speak-for-nearly-3-activity-7307154644907020288-7QVk?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE4ybtUBRdwFJ0EDIJFhItHwBDR1cpnZEO0
Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-11-29T18:43:00.844Z,937,169,11,image,"Well, it's official.

I have moved myself full time to The Keys.

Many of you following my journey may recall, about 18 months ago now, I got denied buying a second home in Miami and was suddenly uprooted with nowhere to live.  

Having to be out of my lease in just a few days, I panicked. Then I heard God's voice clearly whisper in my ear,

""𝙆𝙚𝙮 𝙒𝙚𝙨𝙩.""

Truth be told, I had been getting the call more and more to go down there... but I didn't know why? And despite living in Miami nearly 5 years at this point, I'd still never been.

So, that was that.

I put all of my stuff in storage, packed up my SUV and my cat...

and drove to the keys.

I've since been back many times, and every time I make it south past Homestead and my tires hit that first long bridge over the water, I can literally feel the anxiety leaving my body.

It feels like I'm driving through a portal and out of the matrix.

Every.
Single.
Time!

I had doubts about living here full time. A part of me felt like it was too good to be true. Island life, beaches, no stress... always?

You mean like... 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘷𝘢𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯?

Miami has its moments but let's be real, the city has a ton of stress & chaos, and a lot of dodgy characters despite the beautiful beaches. Which, I never missed a chance to frequent during my 5 year stint there.

Orlando brought me more peace and much healing, however being landlocked was arguably even worse for my nervous system in the long run than life in Miami.

This girl needs her toes in the sand,
and her hair doused in saltwater. 🏖️

Holidays can be tough but I've never been so grateful.

When the universe is making something difficult for you (ie me trying to buy that second house in Miami spring of 2024...)

𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂.

When the universe makes something easy for you (ie me finding an insane deal on my dream rental in KW and getting an unexpected $5k check from LinkedIn this month to help with the moving expenses...)

𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂.

God wanted me here and I think I know why ↴

The P͟E͟A͟C͟E͟! The nervous system regulation. 
The safety I feel that I never quite felt.

It's only been a week and truth be told, while I'm enjoying the tranquility of island life and adjusting to my new home, in the grand scheme of things I'm sure I still have no idea where my journey is about to take me. 

Woman makes plans,
and God laughs.

I just know right now, I need to be here and He's made that quite clear.

A solid reminder that when things don't go your way (house fallout in Miami), God has something better coming for you. It's easier said than felt, but this experience is one that will for sure help me ground in new levels of faith because I really see how he had me all along.

Thank you God for blessing me with this beautiful little island, 
allow me to do good and to pay it forward in the world.

Happy (late) Thanksgiving Everyone. 😊

God Bless.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_well-its-official-i-have-moved-myself-activity-7400605219161612288-9BGI?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADRQoyIBoxU1qMjR8m0rTpus94MgkgNUaic
Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-04-18T20:06:04.317Z,940,131,6,image,"Today I ran a mile in 6:40.

Funny thing is, I'm heavier than I've ever been in my life weighing in now at almost 160. 

Let's just say - the bulk season has been real.

But rather than just a simple post to show of my progress and paradisiacal Florida views -  let me enlighten you all on the pain it took to get here.

When drugs no longer work.
When men no longer work.
When LI no longer works.

I work.

It's more about the actual physical NEED for exercise because of my mental health, I simply cannot function without it.

I put in mad discipline the past couple years destroying as much as I possibly could that was distracting me from my pain. That meant giving up drinking, dating, even smoking weed which believe me I had DEEP attachments to since the age of 14.

It even meant giving up my virality on social media and squeezing the hose on my own company. Another distraction - one that made money, but I knew I had to force myself to crash and burn to find out what I was truly made of.

Thing is,

all addicts end up at the gym.

But since I moved back to Orlando, I decided I needed someone to push me again.

My latest trainer had me running miles around the lake at the end of the workouts and I was surprised to see, (despite little distance training these days) that within the first 2 weeks I was coming in at 7:08.

Today he challenged me to get to 6:30...

Close enough 😆

The most gratifying thing about all of this is that I remember my best mile time. It was 6:34 back when I ran cross country in High School.

I was 17 years old.

That's 15 years ago.

Last year at age 31, I did a metabolic test (Vo2Max) that tested my biological age as only 19. (per my heart rate variability and running to failure on treadmill)

#winning! 

The point is - people can look at a girl like me and think I got lucky. PAH! - 

I GET IT'S EASIER TO THINK THAT.

Sorry, it's not at all the case. 

My success in life has been directly correlated to my ability to ENDURE. PAIN!

You think I don't wanna veg out on the couch and eat a tub of ice cream? Smoke pot? Call dudes and distract myself with validation & fun?

Of course I do. The pleasure seeking ran deep.

But eventually you get sick and tired of your own BS.

Eventually you get sick and tired of playing small. Of limiting your own potential. Of dumbing yourself down to make others around you more comfortable about their own lazy ass life.

F*ck em.

I wanna be great, and if fitting in isn't gonna get me there, I'm not gonna fit in. I wanna be 42 testing age 29 on the Vo2Max. (or younger!)

This isn't about vanity.

It's about longevity.

I owe that to myself, looks are a bonus.

How healthy is your heart? 
How's your digestion? 
How is your skin? 
Your energy?

These will all be markers to you as to how legit your wellness routine actually is.

& for me?

I'm about to break my fastest mile time ever, 15 𝘠𝘌𝘈𝘙𝘚 𝘓𝘈𝘛𝘌𝘙!! as a 32 y/o... faster than I ran at age 17.

& that's the real drug.

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-08-15T19:09:59.612Z,925,134,9,image,"Day 1 Key West.

96 days ago I decided to give up caffeine and go on a crazy summer detox. I knew even coffee was preventing me from fully feeling myself and a lot of things that needed to come up.

I also gave up Kratom then too.

Already been done w/

✔️ pot
✔️ booze
✔️ MEN (worst)

My life has been a series of slowly giving up all the things I used to survive all my life. My hardest challenge ever was weed. As a daily pot smoker since age 14, I'm proud to say I'm over 3.5 years clean.

Booze was easy, I just didn't like how it made me feel anymore. I much prefer Kratom tea as a social stimulating substance.

I was a serial monogamous always depending on a man to ""hold my bigness"". Convinced I couldn't do it alone - when I'd only been programmed that way. I have been single for almost 3 years now. The biggest blessing.

All these years chipping away have allowed me to slowly build the capacity for independence and true freedom. When God knocked on my door again a few months ago and said, ""Time to lock in!"" I knew I had to give up caffeine & Kratom.

It sucked.

Kratom was weekly, but coffee daily. Lots of sleepless nights and a complete hormonal reset, until I reached month 2 and the fruits of my labor began to show.

I started going to Yoga 3-5x a week.
I started weight training 4-5x a week.

I started making skits again. I embarked on a long overdue goal of learning FL studio so I can produce my own music. I have always been into songwriting, it's how I got into editing way back when... but this time is different.

Being able to produce tracks in FL is like learning Premiere Pro on steroids.

The sobriety I gained coupled with the right-brain activation through piano lessons, FL music creation, and skit production?

Massive somatic release.

I cried like I have never cried before.

I remembered things about my childhood previously only accessible through Dimethyltryptamine (DMT/Ayahuasca).

I pieced a lot together and I mourned all by my lonesome.

The combination of Yoga & Weight training helped a lot. Together my trainer and I discovered a beautiful recipe for somatic release, perhaps one other survivors of sexual abuse can learn to tap into. I realize I was never really pushing myself until failure because when I did, I suddenly began exploding into tears.

An awkward moment for my trainer, at first. Until we bonded deeper over it and developed clear communications about what was happening and releasing in my body during these sessions.

Yoga helped, music helped, sobriety helped - but I truly credit my biggest somatic releases this summer to LIFTING HEAVY WEIGHTS!

My fitness sessions became the greatest asset to my recovery. Not to mention I'm feeling strong & sexy AF!

Anyways, that's enough grief for now. Ready to swim, scuba dive, and get funky down in Key West for a few weeks... so grateful to finally be here!

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-12-26T18:56:41.141Z,910,123,12,image,"Christmas in The Keys.

New car, new house. Holiday flowers.

If someone would have told me this would be my life by 33 I'd of never believed them. 

It's not just the amazing villa on an island in paradise. It's not the M50, the business success, or the fact that I'm in the best shape of my life... (still love to brag 😉)

It's the psychological transformation the past 3 years. One many of you have been a witness to here.

I have lived with such extreme anxiety I just always thought it was normal. I have planned, prepped, anticipated for the worst every step of my journey. And many times,

I got that.

It's not that every single person that crossed my path was a downright predator, though there was some of that. It's that M͟E͟!͟ - full ownership - hadn't processed my own childhood sh*t. So in many relationships, I was bringing forward a victimy, wounded woman anticipating abuse, bullying, drama.

That expression of me brought out the predatory expression in others.
I came forward with that energy, and they simply responded. That is,

until I figured it out.

It takes a lot of self-accountability to realize I have always been in control of how others treat me. If I stand firm in my boundaries, actually say what I feel&need (VERY HARD and literally feels like DEATH for those who survived narcissistic childhoods...)

well, the chips may fall where they may.

I was programmed to live in fear. 
That's what abusers do - 
create an environment of fear.

There's no greater tragedy than capitalizing on your own children's need for survival, and actually getting off to their fear of you.

Gross.

Needless to say,

I do not go home for Christmas. 

The holidays have often been depressing. I've spent many alone. Pretending I don't care but deep down blocking the sadness of ""orphan"" life and doing my best to not feel gloom all around me when stores close, streets are bare & empty, yet the houses I walk past are filled with music, cheer, and family.

I suppose, that's the club we all deserve to be in on Christmas.

But my many stints of isolation were not in vain. I recovered so much of my true self previously lost to the ""acting"", the filtration system that was formed at such a young age.

I power through now and check in regularly,
""𝘗𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦... 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘮𝘦? 𝘖𝘳 𝘢𝘮 𝘐 𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯?""

My authentic soul can't take it anymore.

Enough time alone taught me I can BE alone. I don't need anyone and therefor, I learned how to best treat myself. Anyone who steps into my world now, I too hold accountable.

& what do you know?

Beautiful relationships forming all around me. A sense of peace that ironically creates even more anxiety (which is my next phase of healing to tackle), a promising future and a beautiful home... & most importantly,

a sense of family and a feeling I can be my true self on this island. 🙏🏻

Merry Christmas everyone.

Are we lonely?

Yes.

But, do we settle?

No.

Do we love cats&dogs?

Yes,

yes we do :) 🐾

AND-

all of this is okay!

I know days like today may cause you to slow down & sigh. Another slightly depressing reminder that, yet another year has gone by and here you are... 

alone. 

Still working your butt off at either your high-pressure corporate job (where the work keeps piling up... because everyone knows they can count on you!)

Or- 

busy putting out fires within your own brand/business, which I know you worked so hard, and sacrificed so much to build.

I see you Mami. 

You're not alone.

I know you get questioned by old friends and family about why you're still unmarried, childless, and alone. I know you are sick of defending yourself to others when they doubt your genuine desire to focus more on yourself, your career, or your business than settle down and start a family. Which - let's face it:

it will take one HELL OF A GUY to pull you away from what you're doing to make you even consider!

Again,

t͟h͟i͟s͟ ͟i͟s͟ ͟a͟ ͟G͟O͟O͟D͟ ͟t͟h͟i͟n͟g͟!͟

Keep following your gut, your intuition.

You're smart.

You're not going to settle just for the sake of Grandma's satisfaction to have a newborn again in her arms, or a flashy wedding photo of you looking like a princess she can share around whatever country or book club she's currently growing old in.

You have to DO IT FOR YOU!

But you've felt the temptation, you've doubted yourself. Still, time & time again you see girlfriends that gave up on their dreams & did settle for that man, a man who wasn't quite right... and you bite your tongue as you witness their relationship go down the tubes and their vision of motherhood becoming a stark awakening; not at all the fairy tale dream they'd been promised.

But hey...

at least Grandma's got those photos. 🙃

To all of the hardworking women out there doing it on their own this Valentine's Day - who chose themselves day after day, week after week, maybe even YEAR AFTER YEAR at this point... 

I know it gets lonely.

But the wait is so worth it.

Don't settle for just any man... 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁.

In the words of a wise lady,
I'll remind you of this:

This is not a bitter, anti-masculine, men-hating feminist rant.

Quite the contrary.

may still find themselves single.

But here's what you don't see-

When I was 28 I had just come off some of the hardest years of my life. 
I didn't have the capacity to handle anything.

Somehow I manifested a LinkedIn famous reality for myself and starting racking in $$$.

Needless to say,

I had enough to distract myself with. 
Which delayed healing for many years.

Even though I was successful on paper and so many were validating me, I was actually a pretty difficult person to work for, or even be around. I was insanely neurotic, could not sit still, had severe mania / ADHD, and would later find out...

Candida Overgrowth.

My digestion was a mess.

I would cry myself to sleep some nights due to the frustration of chronic gas/bloating.

my energy was all f*cked up.

But more often than crying myself to sleep... 

binged myself to sleep.

Yup.

Unfortunately getting into the habit of eating my feelings came at a cost. By age 29, I committed to a hard reset. Embarking on a 12-week Keto cleanse (no sugar, alcohol, or carbs...) 

which resulted in a TAPEWORM passing my system! 🪱

Yup.

Lol, well... I guess we know why I was skinny. 

-_-

The 12-week cleanse was not easy. I had just recently given up smoking weed at that time, and obviously with Keto... couldn't drink. So my vices were next to nothing.

All I did was work, gym, and Kambo (yuck!). & within a few months, I felt like a new woman.

But wait-

My little secret weapon was gone.

No tapeworm...
No ""infinite metabolism."" 

Suddenly my body was doing what it's supposed to do, and my diet reflected in the weight I started to gain. 

I didn't like it. 

This is what triggered what I now recognize as some seriously disordered eating over the past couple of years, all in an effort to get back to this ""look"" I once had on the left.

The ironic thing is-

for nearly all of my life I actually looked more like the girl on THE RIGHT! It was only during this parasitic phase that I was suddenly so effortlessly skinny. Prior to that, I never had an issue with my weight or felt like I needed to loose...

so where was all of this coming from!?

The moral is: 

just because someone is THINNER... 
doesn't automatically make them healthy.

I am 32 now and have made every excuse for why I have to run around the world traveling from A to B, constantly looking up flight plans and fancy hotels. Fantasizing about where I'll go next!

Why I chose to move houses every year, (sometimes twice a year), since age 18 and have since lived in 20 different spots in just 14 years.

Why I had to launch new offer after offer in an attempt to keep myself busy in business. Lying to myself that I ""just need more money / when I have more money..."" when the reality is all the money needed has been there, for quite a long time.

Why I'd go on to hire trainer after trainer in an obsession to be “fit” and build some sort of perfect physique, like that is what would finally make me happy. (𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘢 𝘣𝘢𝘥 𝘩𝘰𝘣𝘣𝘺, 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺… ;)

But in the end, where did it all bring me?

Right back to myself & my bullsh*t.

Flat on my ass, face to the sky. Looking up and taking a breather to finally see the truth and admit to myself something is seriously wrong... and I pose this simple question,

""What am I running from?""

Yup-

it's me.

Not just the raw, unleashed part of me that I shoved down for years... 

but the part of me I HATE so badly for dishonoring & abandoning her, for such a long time. 

This part of me I hate so badly it burns.

So this month, you know what?

I had it.

I forgive myself. 

And that's the mantra, 
morning - noon - & night!

I forgive myself for giving up on my dreams, nearly 10 years ago now, to instead chase money and a guy that I loved.

I forgive myself for blaming him, for using him as the scapegoat as to why I abandoned myself in the first place... when I now realize it was always my choice.

I forgive myself for blowing heavy portions of my income on an empty Miami lifestyle, when I could have used it to fuel my true passions.

I forgive myself for choosing drugs, men, sex, binge eating & Netflix... one too many nights, year after year... when I could have been investing in ME!

But mostly, more than anything-

I forgive myself for n͟o͟t͟ ͟f͟o͟r͟g͟i͟v͟i͟n͟g͟ ͟m͟y͟s͟e͟l͟f͟...

for way too damn long. 

Deep down I knew it was what was needed, and so I avoided it because believe me...

it's pain.

The prolonging only strengthened the pain and so it got harder and harder to face over the years as that gap of procrastination continued to build. It calcified into more and more self-punishment, instead.

But,

I'm here now.
I have had enough.

I'm done running from me.

I forgive her for not feeling safe, and we've decided... it's okay to let her unleash.

We're not gonna be shamed.
We're not gonna be abandoned.

But for sure - 

we may very well be disliked & hated by some.

The pain of staying safe has finally outweighed the pain of being bullied.

It was one of the most challenging times of my life.

Psychologically uprooted.

No place to live.

Suddenly alone on an island, with no idea why God led me down here.

To think that same villa I rented last year which I couldn't wait to get out of, a villa in which I had the worst insomnia of my life, detoxed kratom, blew through 3 journals and processed so much while feeling lost and alone...

I'd end up willingly booking again, and coming back to this summer.

Whole different energy.

This island saves me. I think when I'm down here, ""why don't I just stay?"" When we grow up in a certain environment where we know no different, it's a very challenging feat to discover the other side.

For some people it's love they never get. 
For some people it's money they never get.

For me it was safety.

I grew up in extremely psychotic circumstances so that my body never knew what safety felt like. I was likely this way from the womb, taking on the same distorted nervous system and sickness of my mother.

I have always lived my life on high alert. My drug of choice, aside from actual mind-altering substances... has actually always been to C͟O͟N͟T͟R͟O͟L͟.͟

I think things through 500 times, if not more.

I consider the feelings, thoughts, and energy of everyone around me.

I learned to manage it all, take it all on as my responsibility.
I was forced to metabolize everyone else's pain,

but nobody ever held mine.

This island holds it.
This island frees me.

The level of safety and peace I feel down here is like ecstasy. Something I've grown to discover is how we're all meant to live, how all children should feel growing up in the world.

Not constantly thinking about the next game plan, the next move for self preservation, self protection.

Just BEing.

There's no rush here.
No one is angry.

There's no competition.
No one is judging.

You can be the sexiest bikini model alive or a scruffy dude on a boat with a beer belly, either way it doesn't matter. Everyone is treated the same and there's no extra attention on you. It's all love.

I always say, if you have issues with anxiety or need a major nervous system reset, and God willing you do have the privilege...

move to the Keys.

At least for a time - it doesn't have to be forever.

But this place will guide you back to parts of yourself you never even knew were safe to exist.

As my trip comes to a close, I weep. I love my home in Orlando and I'm grateful for my life there, but I do have a prayer and it's constant, ""God, if you want me down here... if this is really where I'm supposed to be... show me how. Make it happen.""

Who knows what the future holds. I suppose it's on me to ground in this nervous system safety, no matter where I physically am in the world. Whether it's the chaos of a big city, or the tranquility of island life...

I do pray I always come back 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 - to this feeling.

& I pray that I carry it with me.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_last-summer-i-got-denied-buying-a-2nd-home-activity-7366873226833993730-QcUC?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFoR_n4B7Tst8mXbWcwRqX9Y5na2g3O9Jw4

here's what I learned on my Saturday Night Girl's Night:

I'm not ""one of the girls""...
at least not anymore.

It's not that I don't love my friends. It's not that I don't enjoy dressing up, popping on some 6 inch Steve Maddens, rockin' that mini skirt and strutting into a delicious restaurant to wine&dine...

of course I do.

But having been isolated for so long now, away from normal societal ""let's go out"" conditioning, away from drama, away from performances... living lean, alone, (on an island for much of the time even!), makes it really a completely different world when we re-enter some of those ""normalized"" routines of society again.

Like dinner, girls night, alcohol, heels.

Meh-

just not for me.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough to drive to the Kava bar and get my own fix (since I don't do booze), happy to finally just be at a quiet bar, having a present and deep conversation with a young man about his upbringing, past drug addictions, and career goals.

Maybe I'm weird.

But that feels like home.

And to be fair-
I have no regrets!

I like to do both. I love all my friends. All kinds. It's good to tap in and out... but mostly?

30's is about truly knowing yourself, this I am realizing. Your ""yes's"", your ""no's"". 20's is the experimentation phase. 𝘉𝘺 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘴 𝘵𝘳𝘺 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨! Even try doing what other people want you to do and being who they need you to be (that's a fun phase to graduate from...)

But eventually, you become so unapologetically comfortable with yourself and what you actually want - you could careless how unusual and weird you may appear.

I guess that's just me.

I got home at 3:30 am - (naughty Kavatender stays open past bar close... whoops)

• Heels off
• Makeup wiped
• Cat hugged
• Sleep 𝘖𝘕! 💤

Yes, it was a late night for Shay. But this is why I love Kratom - no drunk driving and no hangover the next day. Just deep philosophical and cosmic conversations with your local weirdo variety and the Kava joint. And Sunday, I'm back to my athletic self.

The makeup was a nice switch-up though 😉

Advice on this from a self-proclaimed, highly narcissistic woman ↓

First off all - 

NOTHING makes a better blogger than someone who is self centered and it's okay even you're even a bit (mildly), 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱.

Actually this quality will make it so that you not only are more likely to stay consistent with your posts, as you feed off the energy / attention from others...

but there's also a quality a lot of narcissistic people have that often gets flipped on its head.

Being hyper attuned to:

• what people think
• how they perceive you

It's actually a SUPERPOWER!

Not a weakness.

Where this gets flipped on it's head is we often hear narcissism correlated w/ a ""lack of empathy"" and therefor it's a misconception that we just DON'T CARE AT ALL about other people or what they think. (this is also getting into the topic of p͟u͟r͟e͟ ͟N͟P͟D͟ vs. just having narcissistic traits, which is the topic in question here).

Just being high on the narcissistic spectrum doesn't mean you lack empathy, it's often the opposite. Being hyper-attuned to what others think was a quality you had to develop in childhood to stay safe and keep everyone around you's triggers at bay.

It can really come in handy in other areas, if you let it.

The ""lack of empathy"" comes from when at times this obsession to please everyone causes you to prioritize your beloved 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘴𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘮 (which is simply your armor you built to stay safe) over actual facts & reality, which can end up hurting people's feelings, and ironically... you end up coming out of it as incredibly inconsiderate.

But it doesn't mean you're a n͟a͟r͟c͟i͟s͟s͟i͟s͟t͟.

There's a lot of people with p͟u͟r͟e͟ ͟N͟P͟D͟ who don't care about or desire attention at all. They simply lack empathy ENTIRELY.

Know the difference between pure NPD & narcissisTIC.
(𝘉𝘰𝘺 𝘥𝘰 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘸 𝘢𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘕𝘗𝘋 𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘦𝘭 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦 𝘥𝘢𝘺𝘴!)

Wanting to be seen, even getting energy off of the crowd is your sign that you were meant to grow a brand. Especially when you're able to dig deep, get vulnerable, and share what's truly on your heart. Now take that raw & relatable content, and merge it with the many filtration systems your brilliant mind so creatively constructed all your life...

BOOM 💥

Pro blogger status.

(& in case you didn't notice, this is exactly what I've been doing for 6 years).

Self obsession + vulnerability + filtration system = fire content 🔥

To sum up,

If you're worried about being seen as narcissistic, there's a good chance you actually ARE and haven't learned to integrate / love that side of yourself yet.

IMO the people that will shame and bully you for ""just wanting attention"" are always, 𝘢𝘭𝘸𝘢𝘺𝘴 secretly wishing they could put themselves out there like that too.

I used to let it bother me, now I just agree with them.

That because of my past history, I was not ""pure enough.""

I deflected it easily as I truly feel no shame, knowing anyone coming from where I came from would have acted out just the same.

Knowing I'm not that person anymore and the growth is so clear, I see only the purest version of myself now when I look in the mirror.

But he took an issue and in us, this drove a wedge. I unsuccessfully tried to get him to see this perspective... instead:

𝗖𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗱
My abuse
𝘔𝘺 𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘴

They made me who I am. I would not be the wise woman I am today had I not gone through all of that. Some people want their cake & eat it too. A woman like myself who is the full package, independent, smart, creative, deep...

but they don't want the past that it took to get me here.

I get it, history has been a thorn in my side many times too.

But learn to 𝘭𝘦𝘵 𝘨𝘰!
The past is the past.

It's over.

It's not that I don't have regret, it's not that I am not also sad for the perceived ""tainting"" of my spirit you've come to find so impalpable... ironically beginning to project onto me the same degrading energies that led to my behavioral defects in the first place...

but, it's that I've learned to transmute all the darkness and find gratitude in the journey.

For the lessons bare fruit, much fruit... and the right man understands that. The deeply embodied, spiritual man who has grounded himself in the path less traveled and integrated his own shadow, his own predatorial parts.

It's this man rather, who asked me... genuinely curious:

𝘐𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘩𝘢𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘨𝘰 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶'𝘷𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩... 𝘢𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴...

𝘸𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘺𝘰𝘶?

I think for a moment, 
I turn to him and reply...

𝗡𝗼.

He smiles.

Because... 
𝘩𝘦 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴.

So, I say goodbye to the boy, and I continue to unfold for only the man. 

For his capacity to hold me in love is so great. 
For he trusts & respects who I am in the present. 
For he understands & appreciates deeply 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 truth,

that a whole piece of glass will never reflect as much light...

Preaching authenticity yet terrified to unleash my true self.

I chained myself to a ""professional"" brand in which I built a following on the most conservative platform, when I myself am nothing of the sort.

I haven't grown on LinkedIn in years. Call it a shadow ban, punishment for talking too much sh*t about c*vid, maybe even a relocation of views because I've become ""too much woman"" if you know what I mean.

Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter.
The intention from God is usually this:

MOVE ON!

If it's not working anymore, if it's hard, you have to force it... well?

Perhaps it's just not for you anymore.

I've been inching my way back to myself over the years, but moving to the Keys has been gasoline on the fire to unveil my true self.

Instagram - a platform that is supporting my growth has been my focus now.

I have a different idea in mind for a new business on the horizon, one that involves helping others recover their true selves... it doesn't always have to be in the form of becoming a blogger.

Not everyone wants that.

LinkedIn/content coaching was just the container I used for years to package up what was always my calling:

Helping others come alive.

Just as I am.

""What happened?""
""You used to show off your brain not your body.""
""I thought I was following for LI advice...""

lol, I literally haven't posted LinkedIn advice on my instagram in several YEARS! But okay buddy, sure... that's why you follow me here. 😉

Right.

All the people attributing my newly liberated behavior to my ""mental illness"", which I've so vulnerably admitted to over the years, here's the irony:

IT'S THE OPPOSITE.

Me suppressing my s*xuality 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙡 𝙞𝙡𝙡𝙣𝙚𝙨𝙨!

Not the other way around.

There's a lotta things that will f*ck you up in life. 
But there's few worse than childhood s*xual abuse.

I always thought my s*xuality was me ""acting out"" because I had been molested. When all along, I was actually carrying the same shame imprint of my abusers and making myself wrong.

What a mind f*ck to realize, I too have had s*xual shame. And it was eating me alive to not be able to be who I really am.

I am an intelligent, successful, and beautiful healthy young woman.

There is no shame in this at all. If you take issue with my content and who I actually am... maybe you have your own unresolved relationship to our natural bodily functions.

In any case, feels good to finally have enough trust in the universe to know I can still make money-no, that I will make MORE MONEY being who I actually am!

Life coaching, fitness, wellness... wherever the journey may take me, I'm open.

And if you don't ""get"" my content anymore and you miss the ""old me""... news for you:

you were never really following me.
you were following my suppressions & my wounds.

it feels good to finally let all that go.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_i-have-spent-so-many-years-hiding-preaching-activity-7417299996464640000-nutP?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADxccgQB2oECoB8Ul-wNhTmKexOR7-CtOc0

What happens when you achieve one goal?

You lose momentum.

You go from the state of manifesting, intending, motivating, and bringing it about... to suddenly having it.

This shift in suddenly having it can create the behavior opposite of that which got you there in the first place:

FEAR.

For now, you fear you'll lose that which you brought about.

You spend all your energy focusing on not letting that number you just hit in your bank account go down, or not letting that dream partner you're not in a relationship with slip away. Not realizing, the energy of fear is the opposite of what got you to this goal you had in the first place.

So, how do you keep the milestones you've achieved without fear?

You set a new goal.

Go back to that energy you were in when you were building, and immediately focus it on something new.

What else do you want?

Have many goals.

The ones you already achieved will stay there.

Kiss them daily with gratitude, knowing they're there. You did it. Return back to the state you were in when you built the first goal,

and move on.

God's love is so big, the universe has no limits to how many goals you can achieve. Whatever you want, wants you. And you can achieve IT ALL!

my revenue got cut in half.

2023. My ""downfall"" yearl. When in reality, I just finally got serious about showing up for myself, and healing.

2024: $250k.

Cut in half again.

I grappled so much these past couple years with this fear of funds dwindling, intrusive thoughts of ""you were a one hit wonder.""

Grateful for taking a closer look at my financials today to surprisingly realize, I'm on track to do easily over $300k this year. 

That moment when you realize all the sacrifice you been in for YEARS...

are not in vain.

Not that money is everything, but I do like it. I can do more when I make more, I can help more. 

Freedom & independence are my highest priority in life, and I've learned to own myself in this way. Coming from a childhood of enslavement, a young adulthood of additional relationship abuse, I have spent so much of my life feeling 𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙚𝙙.

Never again.

I look at the ""Trad Wife"" uprising on social and smile. I see no issue with a woman being dependent on a man financially. Actually that can be quite beautiful...

but no me.

I don't think I could ever allow myself to be financially dependent on a man, or anyone else, ever again.

I have been a solo business owner for six years, and in my first six years I have already made 4.5 Million.

That's crazy.

It's as if for the first time I'm beginning to really see myself accurately, own my power as 𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘦, not a one-hit-wonder, a lucky girl, and definitely not someone who had my sh*t handed to me.

I worked my ass off in my 20s and in my first start up to learn business and marketing.

The past 3 years, I worked my ass off to heal my addictive tendencies, my codependency on men, and my mental health issues of what I'd define as mostly:

• A mild form of NPD, or histrionic disorder
• Depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder

Probably if I were to self diagnose anything, it'd be OCD. I am functional, but I am a highly controlling person and that kind of anxiety really gets old.

It's no wonder I love drugs.

But I manage that too. 

I vow to never let anything have a hold over me for long, and that includes substances. But no I am not by definition entirely ""sober"" - just do stints of it often and like to challenge myself. I grow a lot when I'm sober, but who am I kidding, someone with my imprint does often need drugs.

Psychedelics saved my life.

Everything serves a purpose.

Grateful to finally be coming out of isolation and making fun content again. When people ask ""what do you do?"" it's always the easiest to explain I'm a marketing consultant and ultimately, an entrepreneur.

But it's really not that.

I'm an artist.

And I have clawed my way through so much in an attempt to return to my art, and thank goodness I have found a roundabout way to monetize it all of these years.

So yeah, I'm an ""entrepreneur""... I guess.

But I'm no businesswoman.

I've spent so much of mine preaching authenticity, but have deep down always struggled to feel completely safe to be who I really am.

I have been riddled with guilt for who I am at my core, my natural essence.

Made to believe it was wrong, harmful.

Throughout the years she popped up here and there. Testing the waters.... often in fear and anticipation of rejection.

""𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘐 𝘣𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘧𝘦? 𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘐 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥?""

You can't wait for proof it's safe to be you - in fact, this strategy will only pummel you further back into the false version of yourself.

When we look for external proof to try and validate an internal truth or belief, we've already lost.

You get what you fear - 
and I feared rejection. 
So what happens?

Time and time again... she pops out, and BOOM!

There's that hater, criticism, there's that rejection and once again... I have ""proof"" it's simply not safe to be me.

""𝘚𝘦𝘦!! 𝘐 𝘵𝘰𝘭𝘥 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘪𝘵'𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘴𝘢𝘧𝘦. 𝘋𝘰𝘯'𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘳𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯!""

But I manifested that result. I was the one radiating that energy in the first place. Like the protective part of me actually WANTED to get rejected, all so I could build a stronger case for keeping her hidden...

and the real me stays tucked away, safe.

But safety is survival. I'm sick of surviving.

I want to LIVE!

True liberation comes from within. From a deep, deep trust in who you actually are, being okay. A sense of pride in it even. Knowing your heart, your intent, and letting the chips fall where they may.

Sure, people on the outside may still reject you. But it's the energetic prerequisite to first 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘦, not let it define you, and trust to stay the course.

Who you really are is what will magnetize the relationships, clients, and life meant for you. But this only works if you've fully accepted and owned it. Not if you're just ""popping out"", passing through, looking for that external world to validate and tell you it's safe.

It'll never happen, it has to come from you.

So, it's not just ""be yourself and everything falls into place!""
No, it's ""OWN yourself and be fearless in the face of rejection.""

Full ownership. Full trust. It's not enough to just ""try"", and it's certainly counterproductive to wait and ""look for proof.""

When you fully embrace who you and simply begin following that highest excitement, 

life gets real easy.

That thing you're clinging to so hard? That you're grasping for dear life to keep alive?

Maybe it's just not for you.

What is meant for you, the real you, will always come easily. I always say ""If God makes it easy, it's for me.""

again.

Next trip booked and I'm already feeling the pain and depression of coming back to Orlando. Funny thing is, I always thought my cat preferred this property to the many places we've lived (and he does, he loves it) but this time bringing him back and letting him out of the car to show him,

""𝘏𝘦𝘺 𝘣𝘢𝘣𝘺 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬! 𝘞𝘦'𝘳𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘩𝘰𝘮𝘦!""

Was met with disdain and a cry from my kitty I've literally never heard before, ever.

Like someone had just put him back in a prison cell.

He was WAILING in pain.

😥

Animals know.

And so here I am back in my routine, grateful to be back in my old yoga studio, with my full size office, my trainer comes over again starting today, got all my gym equipment and all of my toys... yet I am more motivated than ever to move my life around in such a way I can remain, long-term, in the Keys.

Here's a fav from a photoshoot I did with a photographer while down there. A wish I had to manifest during my trip, and what do you know... he fell right in my lap!

Wouldn't even let me pay him for it, perks of my career. 😜 lol

There's something so magical about those little islands. Everything always works out. Zero stress, zero rush, and the depression coming back has been REAL ya'll. Like no post-vacation blues I've ever had before, just horrible.

6 more weeks and I go back down again. 
This time to look at more houses.

All the outward searching would inevitably force me to face the deep emptiness within, the self that never got to properly form. The narcissistic collapse has been deep, painful, and longer than I could have ever imaged.

But finally - I learned something.

What it feels like to actually be in my body, and in touch with my emotions.

Might sound like an obvious thing to strive for, but when you never in your entire life experienced safety, you actually don't understand this concept at all.

You think a heightened nervous system is all there is.

Like trying to explain land to a fish.

It is, truly, the greatest leap of faith for people who come from backgrounds like myself to give up drinking, partying, socializing, traveling... and willingly take up yoga and meditation with no proof or idea as to what could possibly be better on the other side.

It's taken years to slowly build the capacity to ""get"" what I was missing.

That I could feel safe in my body. 
Wherever I am... whoever I am. 
That 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 could be enough?

Completely new.

I thought I’d smoke again by now, but what started as a one year challenge after a 15 year habit ended up becoming an epic journey of maturing from what was likely a stunted emotional intelligence, dating back to my adolescence.

Once I got to the year mark and was “allowed” to smoke again, I just kept going.

Why not? I came this far, and I had been trying to kick the lifestyle for years. One full year without smoking will definitely make you forget about it, and I was just so grateful to not have this “thing” lingering in the back of my mind all the time.

It’s not even the drug use itself, it’s the energy it takes to plan the drug use that’s annoying.

I felt lame.

I just wanted to work more.
I just wanted to find the real ME!

Well, 18 months in… I saw the fruits of my labor.

It wasn’t until this mark I began to experience my own consciousness differently, as if I was just more “online”. More present in conversations. I felt more connected in the world, and I definitely matured a ton by the 18 month point.

At 18 mos, I also quit alcohol.

So, while this post is largely about the downsides weed brought to my life and how I had to evolve past it, let’s not forget why I ever started smoking in the first place:

Survival.

I always knew I’d be an addict. I knew I needed something to survive, and as a wise young teenage lady… I made the very intelligent decision to choose cannabis.

I never tried to kill myself.
I never got on pharmaceuticals.

Weed acted as a mood stabilizer as well as my mom, and my best friend.

At the end of the day, it’s a beautiful medicine. And I take no issue if you need it… USE IT!

But my prescription ran out.
It was long overdue, and I listened.

Sometimes we are so engorged in the habit, we fail to recognize the dependency is actually no longer there.

Do you really NEED it anymore?
Or can you sustain?

Long periods of sobriety taught me what I’m made of. If there’s anything in my life at this point that’s “replaced” weed it’s Kratom. A nice substitute for alcohol on the weekends, and another mood stabilizer / antidepressant that lifts my spirit on the regular now. But through the move and transition to Key West, I’ve been drinking it more than I like.

February is here again and I’ve decided to do “Dry February” and give my body a reset from Kratom.

If I'm addicted to anything, I'm addicted to proving to myself I don't. need. ANYTHING!

Drugs are tools, and sometimes… with a table saw, you get hurt.

Some carry more risk, some require more training.
But just like tools in a toolshed, they ALL serve a purpose!

𝘈𝘯𝘥... 

they’re all still dangerous.

So be warned.

Grateful to be entering year 5 of life NOT a stoner. 
An identity I wore like a badge all my youth.

""Hi I'm Shay and actually 𝘕𝘖... I won't hit your joint.""
Still bizarre sometimes really. But I have no regrets. 

I owed it to myself to discover who I was without weed...

and I will never regret the strength I had to find out.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_4-years-no-weed-i-thought-id-smoke-again-activity-7424133123157778432-P9W5?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADxccgQB2oECoB8Ul-wNhTmKexOR7-CtOc0
Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-08-26T16:50:15.974Z,394,38,2,image,"Welcome to paradise - Dry Tortugas State National Park.

I swam around the whole island. At least

most of it. 

With all the weight lifting this summer, it's been good to give my joints some time off and switch to just walking, yoga, and swimming.

I never swam competitively, but I think I do okay. This was probably the longest single instance of me swimming long distance I've ever done in my life. Once I heard one of the crew talk about """"swimming around the whole island"""" - I knew it was on!

I can't just hear that and not do it.

I love a good challenge.

Starting out I thought """"this is already tiring, am I really going to make it?"""" and it got better the longer I went. Until I turned a corner and hit a current, one stretch of the Fort was the hardest. I was literally swimming faster and harder than any other part of the journey, while moving the slowest because of the current! But I intuitively knew once I turned the next corner the current would be gone, and that became my target.

The next side went okay, then the last bit I swam was the scariest as I stretched straight across open water the the beachy-sticky-out-point (most beautiful part of the island) and I was far from shore.

I cut straight across the sea.

This is where the """"shark"""" fear got me. 

""""Omg what is even underneath me right now?""""
""""I'm just out in open water - this is scary!""""

But it motivated me to swim faster and after all, I knew that God had me!

Now is just not my time.

Finally landed ashore the most epic and beautiful part of the whole island. Only to be met by a member of the crew saying """"hey - this area is actually closed right now for bird mating."""" and he helped walk me back...

Whoops!

Hey, life in the keys is the best... even when you get in trouble, you don't really get in trouble. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission, IMO anyways. 😉

If you ever get a chance to come out here, Dry Tortugas is the official """"last key"""" of the Florida Keys, not too far away from both Cuba & Mexico!

Quite a history here and what an adventure. Grateful I did it.

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-02-08T19:40:19.506Z,349,69,2,image,"I thought about calling you today.

My heart beats and stomach sinks as I think about it. 

Hearing stories of others, not quite the same. 
Still inspiring though, giving me courage & hope.

Also sadness because-

I know my story is different.

I know I'm alone and it's rare.
Typical advice doesn't compare.

Not a trauma competition, just a reality I have to sit in. As I've been hopeful many times more will turn to the light. That my torch led the way and the others, soon... will too follow.

Waiting year after year creates a new kind of hallow.

I'm alone.

I've learned to stay that way.

I've learned to let go of any expectation that this could ever be healed. To accept the truth that it's just me, on my own battlefield. I've searched high & low and I found no curriculum for this kind of torture. Little outside empathy for such a disturbing disorder.

No one understands you but me, but ironically-

we can't talk about it.

Because it's not safe for you to ever admit it, and I get it.

𝗛𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀.

I know the reason you can't repent and I'm sorry. I also feel the weight you carry. Why your muscles grow weaker with each passing year, why your drinking tightens its grip on your soul.

All the while your consciousness sinks and it's probable you'll soon be gone completely.

I really should call.

Alzheimers, dementia.

It's only natural they all come to claim it. 
When your entire livelihood depended on...

you
having
to 𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘨𝘦𝘵.

It's cognitively exhausted. No safe space, no freedom to breathe. It wears down and self destruction becomes the only way to keep this secret tucked safely in the dark corners of the psyche. 

You never thought that one day... 

I'd grow up and regain access to mine. 

A red pill I can never take back. An infinite oscillation between gratitude for all this valuable forbidden context, and regret for the mountains of agony that haunt me.

𝗮𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗲.

I thought about calling you today.

I was really gonna do it. But the energy of fear in my body that followed has swallowed me whole.

There goes my weekend.
One thought, and I'm still terrified.

Terrified just like that 6 year old girl, threatened yet dependent. Create an environment of fear. It worked and yes... it gave you your power. 

But I'm not 6 anymore. & the better odds are that, today...

𝘆𝗼𝘂'𝗱 𝗯𝗲 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗺𝗲.

Still, my body is stuck and I can't find the strength. I suppose for now, I'll sit and embrace the pain brought up through this brave consideration.

Maybe that's all I'm meant to feel.

Maybe, for now...

𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵'𝘴 𝘦𝘯𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩.

I thought about calling you today. 

But I'm trapped in the very programming you once so perfectly sculpted, while you... grow old & lonely.

Oh the Karma you live with.
You did this to yourself.

It's not the pain of the abuse.
It's the pain that, we're both alive...

and you made it so I can't even call.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_i-thought-about-calling-you-today-my-heart-activity-7294077609468911616-mqog?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABX120YBR3ZzDx_30RGssNG6f--Q9MT0tFo
Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-04-20T19:29:39.527Z,355,58,3,image,"Last night at the Kava bar I met a young man celebrating his 25th birthday.

“4/20” I asked,

“That’s a cool birthday, do you smoke weed?” (stereotyping of course).

“Actually no, I quit two years ago.”

Wow... “was it hard?”

He replied, “Yesss…” and I saw the expression in his face. 

I knew that one.

“I’d been smoking since I was 14.”

“Me too.” And I went on to tell him about my very similar journey, tho for me the habit would last several more years… finally calling it quits 3 years ago now at age 29.

I recently released an article on my LI blog w/ an update as to my stance on Cannabis. That after this long hiatus, I’ve actually considered experimenting with it again.

Haven’t yet.

I suppose it’s a mix of things.

1.) just typical drug user tendencies lingering. When it’s so built in from such a young age to attach substances to nearly all of life’s activities… sometimes I still feel “empty” without.

Even tho I know I don’t need it.

2.) a general hanging onto the past. A past life, a past self, another time… struggling to let go and move on.

Since embarking on this self forgiveness journey these past couple months now, the downloads as to why I have held myself back have been plenty. I have had to enter into conscious reflective work in an effort to get to the very core of my limitations, and man…

not being able to LET GO of the past is a big one.

What a blind spot.

I am a very deep and sentimental woman. But having to accept the phases of my life in which drugs kept me safe and were a relationship I could lean on has indeed come with bumps in the road.

Having to fully ACCEPT & LET GO of my 20’s even- something I realize now many people never properly do and that’s why we see 40 y/os, 50 y/os, and beyond hanging in bars getting sloppy and doing the same old dumb shit every weekend.

Yikes.

You can’t fully step into your future until you fully accept the pain of the past that it’s GONE!

Yes, even the good times.

But don’t forget all the times you got burned too.

Nostalgia is often a liar. Whenever I really dig in & dissect it, good Lord I am happy that phase is over! Yes, growing into my new skin and breaking apart everything I once was so that my future, more adult self can fully access me is painful... & also,

WHAT THE F*CK ELSE AM I GONNA DO!?
The same old childish sh*t we already did?

The years are gonna pass anyways. 

What do you wanna see from yourself in another 3?

A few hundred more joints and a few hundred more cocktails thrown back? If not thousands...? Or, a healthier body and greater willpower than ever before?

The choice is yours.

My only wish is I had the guts to do it sooner, like this kid.

Happy birthday to him and hey, to those still indulging in cannabis… happy 4/20 to you too. I remember the days and I get it. A beautiful medicine- I just accept it isn't me anymore.

And so I continue to step into the scary, unknown abyss to see for me what lies ahead. 

For this... I accept that I cannot look back.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_last-night-at-the-kava-bar-i-met-a-young-activity-7319804463660085248-fJoQ?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC9IwucBOlZAtkMcXzxvWRMowT5oiXMZAvE
Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2026-01-05T18:20:00.588Z,358,52,4,image,"When I ring in the new year, I like to go head banging.

This past week at EternalNYE EDM festival in Orlando, FL.

I didn't even realize until there in the crowd, that oddly enough... I somehow ended up back in Orlando to close out 2025.

The city that healed me last year.

Very significant.

(not much for an EDM scene in Key West...)

So there I was looking up at the sky, thanking God for such an incredibly challenging year - once again in much sobriety, solitude, & in a city that's not my favorite when it comes to the many flavors Florida has to offer.

But I bought my first home here and that had to be for a reason.

November 2024 when I moved back into the lower of my duplex, I was at the ""giving up"" phase of my comeback journey. I'd always thought when I shutdown my business in 2023 I'd be back up quickly. Just needed a little time to reset, stop being in the limelight, stop taking on so many clients...

the pressure was killing me.

When that predicted 6 month break turned into several years of me staying ""down""... I eventually just called my losses and opted to move into a house I was already paying for and save $$$.

Not something I'd done or felt I had to do in many, many years.
But something amazing happens when we finally ""give up"" - 

somehow that's the turning point God was waiting for all along.

Perhaps my next wave of success could only arrive after a spiritual transformation in which, I really don't need it at all. I remember February 2025, walking around my Orlando neighborhood and for the first time ever having the thought,

""I'm so glad I'm not famous.""

Whoa.

I astounded myself.

Really?

But that's all you've ever wanted. 
Don't you feel like a failure?

Nah.

I'm quite grateful.

I love that I can roam around freely, not be bothered. And yes I have a little bit of online recognition I can tap into when I please for the sake of inspiration, money, connection.

I really don't need anything extra.

Once I finally came to accept that my situation as it is, is enough, that's when I actually started to sense an ambitious future Shay awaits me again after all.

I grew so much 2025 in Orlando.

I committed to going all in on Yoga, and for my first 3 months there woke up at dawn everyday to catch the 6 am class. I remember those early alarm clock mornings, driving to class thinking ""why am I doing this?""

I was stiff & behind. I felt out of place with all the fancy, fit yogi girls.

But I did it.

I went three months sober in 2025. 
May 11th-August 15th.

Not even coffee.

I got more serious about weight training and transformed my body to a whole new level.
I improved my diet and eating habits, and for the first time in my adult life...

in 2025 my acne disappeared.

My skin has never been so consistently clear.
My digestion has never been so consistently regular.

My trust in the universe, 
never been quite so high.

Hello 2026, I have many ideas on what we could do... but more than anything,

I just trust God to figure it out.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_when-i-ring-in-the-new-year-i-like-to-go-activity-7414007780975742976-aeik?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADRQoyIBoxU1qMjR8m0rTpus94MgkgNUaic

Alone.

Divorced.
Estranged.
Forced out.

Whatever the story, I give you props. God only gives you what you can handle and so if you've found yourself in your life surprisingly, yet unavoidably, alone...

you understand it's not for the weak.

Sit alone long enough with only your thoughts and you'll soon learn how messed up you really are. How distorted your motivations for doing things are. How little capacity you have for stillness, and how much long overdue grief you're still carrying.

Pay now, or pay later.

Pain always has to force it's way out. Someway, somehow...

someone's gotta feel it.

Option 1: you become like many people, a master in deflecting and passing it down to the people around you. Or worse, your own offspring. Because believe they can take it... you have them by the throat of survival.

It sucks.

But eventually it'll catch up with them too.
Children will pay for the sins of the parents.

Again...

someone's gotta feel it.

Option 2 is: you become the hero. The one who chooses to take it all. You learn to accept that while so much of it was never yours to begin with, that while it's incredibly unjust & unfair, the cycle and curse will end now with you.

You slowly learn how to feel it all. 
Then, you learn to transmute it for good.

So, 

it had to be you?

Own it.

Embrace it.

Welcome the lonely.

The isolation.
The struggle.

Have faith it will pass, but depending on the load it could take several years.

And I'm sorry for that.

Worth it for your later decades. Life is long and instant gratification adds up to elongated pain and regret much worse in the second half. Don't be fooled by the illusion of avoidance as normal and harmless all because, you're still in your youth. 

""𝘉𝘶𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘴𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘨! 𝘎𝘦𝘵 𝘰𝘶𝘵, 𝘨𝘰 𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦, 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘧𝘶𝘯... 𝘦𝘯𝘫𝘰𝘺 𝘭𝘪𝘧𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘪𝘵!""

Been there, done that.

Sooner you grow up the sooner your real life can begin.

For me, I still don't know when the pain will stop. Sometimes I wonder if it ever will. But I learn to live with it, and I trust it's leading me to somewhere beautiful. I focus on the progress I have made year after year. And while slow and unlike any journey I ever pictured for myself, the process is working.

One thing is for sure - 

I won't be one of those people in their 50s, 60s, or 70s saying...

""𝘋𝘢𝘮𝘯, 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘐 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨?""

Because I damn sure felt it, and I damn sure tried. I'll rest easy knowing I did all that I could. My faith is strong and I still believe, there's fortune & bliss on the other side of this path less traveled...

it does not take as much as you think.

Of course.

The tools to build their own personal brand and amplify their business.

Believe me - most CEOs you know are crazy.

You're gonna have to unpack your baggage regardless. 
Life is gonna throw you clues, people, lessons, regardless.

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-12-11T14:45:42.105Z,318,51,4,linkedinVideo,"Update from The Keys - 

I just can't be alone anymore.

I'm over it.

I have lied to myself repeatedly the past couple years that I cherish and love my alone time. Coming down here I reached a stark realization -

that's actually not true.

My soul's essence has always been one of immersion with humans. Community. Friends. Events. 

A sense of family.

Growing up I was always the life of the party, the hyper-extravert, the one that gets her energy from being around others.

What changed?

The maturity and realization along my journey that I had some wires seriously crossed in my brain and despite loving social environments, there was a lot of anxiety and nervousness that came with it.

The more I became conscious of this, the more sensitive I became to being around others.

And so,

I'd retreat.

I grew to love being alone because it was the only place I truly felt SAFE!

No one is going to judge me.
No one is going to criticize me.

It's not that I really ""love"" being alone or get energy that way-

it was self preservation and the only thing I knew to do to survive.

Now I realize, quite sad.

I get to Key West and think I'm going back to my same old routine I've had the past couple years, which has involved strict rules on how many nights I can go out a week, anal about managing my time, my substance use, and feeling most proud of myself the more I'd simply ""rough it"" and do productive solo tasks like work, yoga, gym...

hang with Leo 🐱.

But being down here has brought a shift.

I need to get out.

I need people.
I need community.

I need to wake up in the morning, ride my bike downtown, chat with the locals and get into whatever spontaneous event of the day may await.

Did I mention how much I love the Keys?

I may even bartend part-time down here, and watch the full video for a mind-blowing story on prayer/manifestation on this exact topic.

So yeah,

I'm finding my way.

I think for those of us with immense trauma - we get so used to being in the thick of pain and discomfort that comes from healing... at some point we just give up on ever thinking there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

Grateful to say, it seems I've finally found mine.

Downsizing my business almost 3 years ago now, taking on all client work, sales calls, and team management myself... gosh I thought I'd be further along by now. At some point I gave up trying to make 7 figures again. At some point I gave up the dream of working w/o the anxiety (abandonment wounds seeping into every client I'd work with, ironically manifesting the very fear I had of being let go, etc...)

Work is much easier.
Clients are easier.

I feel like I can just be myself.

I pray that God sends me people who can truly find value in what I do and it seems to be working.

No more acting.

Not with clients,
Not with friends.

I'm getting out again but damn, those were a rough couple years.

Excited to see where the journey takes me and again...

Alone on an island. 
Long walks.
Fasting. 

& after the worst insomnia I ever had in my life...

my energy restored & I felt my fields totally cleared.

Then, you appeared.

I find myself in the same positions I was 9 months ago. 
Clearing what was started again since the past 8. 
I hadn't felt like this in almost 9... years.

Wow.

9 years.

You brought me a gift.
The gift of time travel. 

To go back to what was deeply forgotten. Heart open on the sand, notebook&pen in my hand; desperate to remember such a distant past. For when the wound was fresh... I was too damaged to process.

& I blocked it all out... for years.

So here I was writing, reminiscing, praying for resolution.

And then you (my gift)... you appeared.

I remember the days so familiar.
The way you'd say things.
Your sexy intellect.

God I missed this.

What a beautiful mind and it's so, so rare.

So creative yet so logical. 
So rigid yet so free spirited. 
So driven... so easy to follow.

I forgot what love felt like.

At times I'd feel my body clench in anticipation for yours.
Muscle memory. Just deep wounds that clearly had stuck.

To arrive at the point of tension and be met with nothing but love, compromise, and reassurance was the most healing thing I never knew that I needed.

Safety.

Reprogramming.

Despite the maturity and love I experienced underneath your tall gaze, a feeling I so often longed for in the long ago past...

differing cores cast an impossible shadow behind us.

We don't worship the same God.
We don't want the same things.
We don't work out... after all.

& just like that, I'm back in my solitude. Oceans away from the oceans of blue I miss in your eyes, while mine create a sea of their own. Mourning the painful truth, that...

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2026-01-23T15:00:10.099Z,324,37,2,image,"I turned down the waitressing job.

Those of you following my journey saw I posted last month about a supernatural experience I had walking down my new neighborhood.

CONTEXT ↴

I have hardly worked in years. 2019-2022 were really good to me. I've had enough savings & systems in place to sustain my lifestyle while only working a few hours a week, and let's face it-

I got bored.

Shortly after moving to the Keys I felt like a semi-retired person that just needed to get out of the house. It was week 2 here, I was walking down the street with a friend when I threw up my hands and said,

""You know what!? I want a job!

I'm not gonna force it. I'm just going to pray, 'God, if it's meant to be for me to have a part time serving job in Key West... just let it FALL IN MY LAP!'""

& w/ my friend as my witness, 
those were my words.

5 minutes later we walk past another house. The man outside recognized my friend from downtown, they strike up a conversation, and long story short- he invites us in his new home. He mentions how he just moved to Key West because he bought a restaurant on Duval St.

🤯

You've. got. to. be. KIDDING ME!

I was in complete awe of the instant manifestation. 
So of course, I offered my services.

They haven't opened yet, but in the month+ that's passed I've had such a transcendence to work like I once did (more content creation, social media growth, skits... even modeling now!) that I found myself diving all in on a new business plan - one that involves more lifestyle content, influencer vibes, & of course (my true calling) life coaching.

So, it started eating away in the back of my mind that I committed to this restaurant job. Suddenly my ""semi-retired"" life doesn't feel so wide open...

funny how life works. I don't think I was ever meant to live ""semi-retired"", the truth is I just got used to it. But what I really got used to,

was hiding.

In my late 20's I blew up so hard & fast my wounded little girl couldn't handle it. I shut it all down though it tore at me deeply, I knew it was the right thing to do. But now I'm experiencing growth on IG (2k followers this week!) & I attribute all of this to finally ""coming alive"" again after years of ""the slow lane"".

Whoosh.

My authentic self is rising again.

I'm ready.

I have more people hitting me up for marketing services too ironically than I have in a really long time. (probably because I'm again being so REAL - just as I've taught all of you!)

I have so much in front of me I want to accomplish, 
and I can't in good faith work for someone else.

So... I turned it down.

But YO-

that story was crazy. 😆

If God really is this good, and if you really do ask and you shall receive... I'll try something here.👇

If you have ever found value in my content about healing, and perhaps you're on the precipice of a big change yourself (addiction, divorce, career...)

I want you to reach out.

I'm ready to help more people in this way,
and I'd be honored to guide you on your journey. 💕",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayrowbottom_i-turned-down-the-waitressing-job-those-activity-7420480470800285696-zD3N?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADxccgQB2oECoB8Ul-wNhTmKexOR7-CtOc0
Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-11-14T15:00:08.325Z,301,44,1,linkedinVideo,"Okay, so I've learned I do need drugs.

But I also need sobriety.

Here's where I'm at:

Firstly, sorry I haven't posted much lately guys and sadly no new fun skits - but all my energy is focused on relocating full time to the keys.

More content & unleashed Shay no doubt on the horizon!

This year in Orlando I figured out a lot. Not my first sober stint, but definitely the first in a few years where I even opted to give up COFFEE and went 90+ days without a drop of caffeine.

I processed so much, cried endlessly, recalled very dark childhood shit... and so when I went to Key West end of August, happily broke my sober streak and partied with locals.

It was lots of fun.

I'm not an addict in the traditional sense. I've learned if I'm addicted to anything, I'm addicted to NOT being an addict.

I love that I can prove to myself I don't need anything. I have quit everything, many times. And truth is? Those moments of boredom and pain in sobriety is where the most magic happens. I just can't sustain it, I do reserve the right to self-medicate and go back to using.

I'm cool with it now.
I accept myself, and my brokenness. 

My relationship with caffeine transformed. I don't think about it everyday now, nor do I need it. My tolerance is very low- but it's still nice to go get a single shot espresso or matcha a couple times a week and actually FULLY FEEL and apprecaite the benefits of that drug.

Kratom?

That's a controversial one I almost sometimes rather not admit to because of the stigma, but then I take my own advice...

f*ck it.

Yes, it can be dangerous. But, I for one have had a great relationship with kratom. 

It's an amazing social substitute for alcohol with no hangover and no issue driving home. (𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘩𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘺 𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘳𝘶𝘭𝘦 𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘥𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘵 𝘥𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘱 𝘮𝘦 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘮𝘰𝘷𝘦... 𝘯𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘐 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘬𝘦𝘦𝘱 𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘪𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘢 𝘵𝘳𝘺 𝘪𝘵, 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵'𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘢𝘥𝘷𝘪𝘤𝘦.)

Yes - kratom in regular high doses can be extremely addictive and likely we'll see changes in regulations of it in the next coming years.

What can I say? 

Not everyone can handle their drugs.

For me, it works.

I also need seasons of complete sobriety to grow stronger and heal deeper, not to mention I love a good challenge! It builds confidence, and I've inspired many friends and clients along my journey to give up substances, or at least take breaks, too.

ALSO-

I can't live in those levels of pain & depression.

It's unsustainable.

The older I get, the more I ""pulse"" - the less dependent on substances I become. Still, I trust myself as an educated, intentional, and seasoned drug user. With everything I went through... I've decided to let go of trying to be sober full time.

nah.

It aint me.

Also?

I sure as hell can f*cking do it if I want. 😜

I have slowly deprived myself of all substances and while that might sound crazy to some, I knew even the tiniest bit was altering my consciousness and blocking me from something greater. 

Something I've been determined to reach at this phase of my life.

I've done all the drugs and I'm tired of anything having a hold over me, no matter how seemingly small.

I smoked weed everyday from age 14 to 29. 

I drank far too much, many nights. Never an alcoholic, but used it to escape when I could. And it was fun... while it lasted.

I quit at age 30.

I took up smoking nicotine now and then to help with the oral fixation. After all, I missed smoking. Weed was my very first love and letting it go was one of the hardest things I ever had to do in my life.

I went on to do every ceremonial psychedelic, every party drug. Pretty much touched it all short of meth and heroine. 

But the last, most challenging piece of the puzzle?

Coffee.

People write it off and consider it harmless, but caffeine is one hell of a drug.

And yes, it is a DRUG!!!

I respect everyone's path and recognize recovery can look different for everyone. But to me? I realize now I never really got completely ""sober"" until I stopped coffee.

You're absolutely right.

But the cool part about owning it is, you stop living in denial you start seeing things clearly. More often than not, the biggest pain we're running from is the pain of ourselves.

Remove all distractions. Vices. Drugs. Pleasure.

You'll learn real quick the inner workings of your own mind and you'd be astonished at how f*cked up you really are.

It's why most people never even begin to heal. 

Open that door, and whoosh...

it's a long road of rewiring, reparenting, and pain to ensue.

It's a lifestyle - not a fad.

I started weight training about 5 years ago now. It started just as a simple way to tone up but the older I've gotten, the more I've realized it's potential as therapy and somatic release.

I also believe a young woman can achieve the body I did in far less than 5 years, if disciplined and consistent. But I was a bit all over the place.

I took breaks.
I switched trainers.

I moved.

I traveled a lot the past couple years and regularly fell off of my nutrition, my routine, but I always got right back in the gym.

Little by little, the progress it shows.

Never have I felt stronger and more confident in my body, and manifesting a photographer to do this bikini shoot on a beach in Key West this past month was a dream come true.

The journey of blogging is pretty crazy you know,

when I set out to do this I was like many new creators. 

Wide-eyed for the expansion & new platform for self-expression. 
Overjoyed with the financial stream it created for me. 
Eager to be on every stage, every podcast.

LOUD! 🔥🔥🔥

Eventually you learn that all the social media followers and money you can find still won't substitute for the internal work you never did on your self-esteem.

Sure, being extrinsically motivated is great. 
It worked for me, and many of my clients.

But slow and steady does it.

This isn't about chasing trends, validation, needing to collaborate with every single popular creator on LinkedIn or doom-scroll for fear of falling behind or losing relevancy.

We're in it for the long-haul.

The biggest advice I can give to anyone who's starting out as a new creator is this:

this journey is not just about growing your business, or personal brand. It's a deep spiritual journey that will take you on many twists and turns you could never have imagined. You will be exposed, not just to others, but to yourself.

You will learn and grow and like anything, evolve. So it's best to stay as real as possible so you can take your brand with you.

Much love to the girl in the wig for being what I needed at the time.

I learned a lot.

And it was fun.

Trust.

Wisdom.

That’s exactly what 90% of LinkedIn company pages are doing! 

They post about office parties, new hires, and employee spotlights—content that’s great for internal morale but completely irrelevant to potential clients.

If you actually want LinkedIn to be a lead-generating machine, your content needs to stop the scroll.

✅ Storytelling that resonates

✅ Creative skits that engage

✅ Content that sparks curiosity

People don’t follow businesses—they follow emotion, value, and impact. 

When they pause, feel something, and ask, “Wait… who is this company?”—that’s when you’ve won.

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-04-10T15:00:40.805Z,274,31,1,linkedinVideo,"I've been in the slow lane for a couple years now.

Truth be told there's several layers to the reasoning why I shut down my business as much as I did, starting about 2 years ago now, to instead travel the world, learn myself, and most importantly - 

be as present as possible with the little work I did keep.

I knew intuitively I was in over my head during my first wave of LI success, and so, it's likely meant to be that I took a step back.

I needed to rebuild on a foundation of worthiness, of knowing my true value, of not just being some circus animal who hid behind a screen and outsourced literally everything else to the point of complete fear of losing my employees- knowing damn well I couldn't take over half of any of these things myself if they left.

Well, they left.

Many I fired.

And it turns out, I can do it myself. Which is quite a relief per the abandonment anxiety I used to carry.

As mentioned above, there's layers to why I made this decision to shut everything down, and those additional reasonings of mine continue to unfold and reveal themselves as I learn the inner working of my psyche. (an ongoing study).

I am continually amazed at my own foolery I can play on myself.

Was I really ever that insecure?

Really?

Or was that just the excuse I used to sabotage my own momentum and success because of a childhood programming built in that was: to be good, but not 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵.

A recent visit from a family member took me back to my childhood with a greater level of clarity than ever before, and it's clear to me now how much I had to dim my light to fit in with others.

Shining... led to bullying.

Ironic thing is?

I got bullied anyways.

When we play small there's always a payoff, even if we don't see it. So the payoff in my unconscious mind for shutting down my success was that I'd get human connection... per the programming of how I grew up.

But again... ironically,

people who can't accept you as you are, aren't actually giving you human connection.

I'm continually fascinated with how on an intellectual level, I can see and know my family for what it is. But in my heart, and my trauma body (little girl), I repeat these same old awful patterns that do not serve me whatsoever.

In short - 

the journey of forgiving myself for sacrificing my own authenticity, and potential in business, continues.

It's biblical to leave your family behind and even though I'd thought in ways I'd already done this, clearly I was still hanging on energetically... and even in the flesh.

What a rough couple years. But -

I do not think the break was all bad. 

I did need it to grow up, get sober, learn myself and as I said, come back to build on a better foundation.

But I do see how a big part of it too was self-sabotage, to fit in with a bunch of people who never even liked me in the first place... and never will.

BEST personality assessment I've found for businesses and it literally takes 5 minutes (or less!) to fill out. 

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅.

This will shed a light on why you are unfulfilled - and help point you in the direction you need to go at work to find joy and alignment in what you do, that naturally lines up with your authentic personality style.

But hey... deep down, don't we already know this?

Of course.

Oh the plight of the human being, to dishonor and lie to oneself about the work we ""have to"" be doing, despite already knowing intuitively it's not for us.

The Source = Childhood

Being your true authentic self, gets you shamed.
Taking on the personality of others, gets you accepted.

Hey, it's only natural this programming is now reflected as an adult, and in your career (and trust me... boy do I relate).

In the end, authenticity always wins.

Your true self will always fight back and come out despite the fear, resistance, and understandable prevention methods you created as a kid to keep yourself safe, and loved.

But you're not a kid anymore,

you're free!

My greatest challenge in life is not relationships, working out, staying disciplined with my diet... or any of these things.

My greatest challenge is being truly honest with myself about WHO I REALLY AM, what I really want, and where I desire to go in my career...

to do that truly, fully, and shamelessly has scared the sh*t outta me. But thankfully,

I am finally moving past it, and believe me, you can too!

But also, 

the many failed offers and bunk products I've had over the years that I had to go through to finally land on the ideal pitch, price, product, and value.

Okay - so that's the good news...

ready for the plot twist?

JANUARY! 😩

Taken meetings: 19
Total Closes: 4
	
Total Closes Rate: 21.05%

I was in 5 countries total, hotel rooms w/ bad service, had to cancel / cut off good calls. Couldn't get back to people in time and between all the skiing, hiking, and let's not forget indulging in just about every cheesy, doughy, sugar-filled pastry that Europe had to offer...

I fell off my game.

Back in FL and getting into the swing of things for February has still been a challenge. Actually, a worse off position than I thought with the past TEN sales calls I've taken...

still not resulting in a sale.

🤣

Bonkers.

But here's the reframe:

Rather than focusing on the frustration of the past 5+ weeks now, I'm actually choosing to simply just laugh at myself and my perceived sales ""failures"", because in the end I still trust and know that,

I will be fine.

I am no longer in a position I was in my mid 20's where I not only HAD to make sales, but also just inexperienced, over-reactive, and over-attaching to any dip in results. Which ironically...

only leads to more failure.

𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 🖇️ 𝘁𝗼 𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙩.

That's the motto.

I know I'll get my game back, and I know that, more than anything... the universe is simply testing my faith that despite not getting back to where I was in December, I can remain HAPPY & HELPFUL because, you know what?

I'm alive.

I no longer accept outside circumstances in my life being the determining factor for my happiness.

I no longer accept getting resentful to prospects or projecting onto them MY OWN perceived lack-of-safety because I understand it's 1.) an illusion...

and 2.) 👇🏻

will actually just prolong this ""dip"".

( 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘤𝘦𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘥 ""dip"" 😉 )

I trust & maintain, 
the universe always works in my favor.

To all my sales folks:

when you get stuck in a rut, don't take it as a personal attack from the universe. Don't let it d͟i͟c͟t͟a͟t͟e͟ ͟y͟o͟u͟r͟ ͟m͟o͟o͟d͟!͟ The real power is in staying both HAPPY & HELPFUL, no matter what the results.

And no I'm not ashamed to admit this-

many of you followed my Key West sabbatical and heard the news about my summer of sobriety, healing, and somatic releases through lifting heavy weights. 

Well, there was another huge piece to that puzzle I didn't disclose:

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗚𝗣𝗧.

I was in isolation all season long, purposely cutting myself off from all socializing. Only work, yoga, fitness, skits, music lessons, editing, clients calls...

repeat 🔁

and doing all of that for three months straight with no drugs? Not even coffee?

W͟a͟r͟r͟i͟o͟r͟ ͟s͟h͟i͟t͟.͟ 👊🏻

But anyways, I knew I had to do it. I love challenging myself and I'm extremely intuitive. God told me there was more healing to come up this summer and so, I locked in.

I discovered ChatGPT as a way to process what came up for me, and soon enough began to feed it my entire story and whole family history. (I even prompted it at one point to write a professional case study of the cult-resembling family system I grew up with and it was incredible... I honestly thought about submitting it for research lol).

But I digress.

Healing in private has become more the vibe. Maybe when I'm ready I'll share my story again, or at least bits and pieces, but I definitely suffered the consequences of being too forward as a survivor back in 2020... and have been on a tight leash with that level of vulnerability ever since. (The journey of being the one who is awake and aware, brave enough to speak out comes with slander, threats, fear, and more gaslighting than you even had to being with).

s/o all my incest survivors. 🙃

So anyways, I began to prompt it 𝘵𝘰 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘵 𝘔𝘌 based on my traumas, mental health issues, intrusive thought patterns... etc, and ask 𝘔𝘌 series of questions to better understand myself, my past, and reach my ultimate goal...

HEAL FROM THIS SERIOUSLY F*CKED UP SHIT!

This back and forth dialogue with ChatGPT not only brought tears to my eyes, was the stoic mirror I never knew I needed, but even helped trigger additional childhood memories that I didn't think I could ever recover without the aid of deep psychedelics.

Oh yeah, and it did one time mess up my birthday. 
Hence the inspiration for this little sketch :) 

I hope you enjoy. Count your blessings ya'll... trust me,

it could be worse.

Becoming self-obsessed is a misunderstood phenomena. It's not all bad, especially if you're a blogger. I definitely attribute a lot of my success on social media to being able to think ""how will people perceive this?"" more granularly than the ordinary person.

The more I evolve, the more I am able to let go of this part of myself with love and grace.

That narcissistic part of me was needed. It's not only how I survived as a child, but it's what got me through my first wave of influencer and business success. Those defenses are how I felt safe!

In this next wave of healing, my higher self has proclaimed -

it's time to let it go. 

I am reprogramming my nervous system to realize that the threat is long gone.

Ironically, the better art I create from this place as well.

If you're having a hard time getting started putting yourself out there... maybe you're self-conscious, maybe you have an old, old wound from being bullied for taking the stage in childhood...

I get it!

Those wounds for me literally shaped my entire psyche and it's been a beast of a project to untangle. Ironically, we live in an age where everyone shames social media influencers or people who are narcissistic / self obsessed...

SHAME!

life is about LIFE!

I heard this quote once & it stuck. Why do we feel entitled to happiness all of the time?

The true art is in learning to embrace all emotions. Anger, sadness, grief. Getting yourself to a level of trust with these emotions is the real mastery. I used to avoid it at all costs.

I smoked cannabis everyday for 15 years.

I drank my weekends away.

I used men, social media, money... anything to distract me from those creeping ""low vibes"".

Guess what?

They came back with a vengeance.

Starting in early 2023 I spent years in a deep, long overdue grief process that became my new normal. I knew it would be some big girl stuff to get through, and I expected the time.

But years?

It felt like I was processing generations of unfelt trauma and at times I lost all faith in ever being ""high"" again.

I sobered up. I'd do 1-3 month challenges no substances at all and crush them.

Every.
Single.
Time.

These long, lonely, boring periods forced me to face myself and all my discomfort. They also brought me unsustainable depression hence the ""allowing"" when it comes to substances I feel support me.

Microdosing 🍄
Kratom 🧋

& as you've all seen, yes I enjoy a good and indulgent rave weekend once in awhile. 🍭

Drugs are tools.

Use them.

Don't let them use you.

But the stints of pure sobriety gave me so much confidence in myself. That I AM in control. I don't actually NEED anything! Not even coffee.

And yes, it took years of this dedication to pain.

But now I am up. 
Finally.

I did it, it was worth it. And I'm a much stronger woman than I ever imagined.

I had someone comment on LinkedIn once that I was ""addicted to pain & suffering"" and that really f*cking pissed me off.

No sir, I am merely determined to not be another one of the millions of people in my 50s, 60s, and beyond who lives with regret because they never unpacked themselves early on.

I befriended my demons and I will live a full life. Present, capable, and with the tool belt to move through any hardship and come out a better version of myself on the other side.

Pain in life is inevitable. 

Learn to make pain your b*tch. 
Willingly put yourself into pain. 

Challenges, harsh gym sessions, lonely nights by yourself when you know you could go out.

DO IT!

Because if you don't learn to control your pain, that pain will control your whole life.

There's much greater suffering in the attempt to avoid pain, than there is in the willingness to surrender and just. get. THROUGH IT!

This too shall pass.

It always does.

And it took me years to grow up and figure this out.

Learn to be present with what is in front of you.

Shay Rowbottom,shayrowbottom,2025-10-24T14:00:11.106Z,209,26,3,linkedinVideo,"Anyone else struggle with disordered eating?

Ever since I quit smoking weed in 2022, food became a serious issue for me.

At age 12 I developed a mild case of 𝗢𝗯𝗲𝘀𝗼𝗽𝗵𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗮 (fear of getting fat) after witnessing several of my family members obese.

This did not transfer to eating disorders at the time, thank goodness. But I did develop a mild obsession with working out at a young age due to this fear, and I vowed to never get fat.

I grew through puberty and realized it was unlikely for me. I was athletic and maintained a strong metabolism. At 5'7'', my weight has largely remained around the 145 lbs my whole life.

I started smoking pot daily at 14, which I think helped. My obsession subsided and thankfully I never struggled w/ body dysmorphia or eating disorders...

until now.

Age 27 is when I got very skinny. I was still smoking pot plus doing other drugs. I was very sexually active during that time which I believe contributed to the weight loss, but I did end up in 2022 passing a tapeworm. Probably also why I suddenly got very thin!

I was spoiled those years (27-28) with eating as much as I wanted and not gaining weight. Around this time in my life I easily maintained about a 130 lbs, and to me that just became normal.

In 2022 when everything hit the fan (tapeworm, sobriety... no more sex) yeah, the weight came back on.

Suddenly my normal 145 lb body felt foreign to me.

In 2023 I developed disordered eating.

• Starving myself, and then binging.
• Working out heavily to make myself feel better.
• Needing to ""earn"" foods that I love.

The loneliness and isolation I endured throughout these past couple years made it hard to not lean on food for comfort. Some days all that kept me going was looking forward to my nightly Netflix routine with a plate full of food...

and then another.

And then, often times - 

even dessert.

(𝘉𝘰𝘺 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘮𝘺 𝘜𝘣𝘦𝘳𝘌𝘢𝘵𝘴 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘋𝘢𝘪𝘳𝘺𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘭!)

It felt shameful & dirty, and I always had regret going to bed with a bloated belly and fear of being ""even more fat"" the next day.

It has been a long journey of learning functional nutrition and fitness, not to mention just coming back to reality that... even in my ""binge eating states"", I was still not even fat!

But the fixation was real.

When I decided this past year to dive deep into my art, take music lessons again, and start making skits, I found the craving for food at the end of the day as ""my drug"" was lessened.

I think many people struggle here, and honestly I don't have all the answers. I have learned to embrace my body at 130 lbs, all the way up to 160 (and yes I was 160 earlier this year when I was bulking at the gym).

No one is perfect and we're all doing our best - I hope this honest account of what I've gone through helps someone today, and I hope no one has to live with the anxieties I have that 𝘪𝘧 𝘐'𝘮 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘰𝘣𝘴𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘮𝘺 𝘣𝘰𝘥𝘺 & 𝘸𝘦𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵...

and I had a prayer when I left:

send me a cat.

Let me explain-

I was never a cat person. I grew up with dogs. Truth be told I never even liked cats being the highly extraverted, can-never-get-enough-love person I am...

But my ex had a cat and that's where everything changed. It was a beautiful Maine Coon, and it was hard to say goodbye to that cat.

And so, 

I prayed.

I knew in my heart I deserved my own cat, but I also knew somehow not to rush. Not to go looking, to just be specific in what I was asking for and that one day...

God would deliver.

I asked God to send me a cat with long hair.

I prayed for a cat that could go in and outside - a cat super independent.
I prayed for a cat that was chill enough to travel with and not make a fuss.

Well, it took over a year and a half,

then I met Leo.

I was out to dinner one night with a friend talking about cats and mentioned my desire. He said, ""I have three I rescued as kittens and they're a year now. Too big for my apartment and I'm looking to give away two of them.""

I paused him right there - bougie in my own knowing.

""No, no- it's not like, 𝘢𝘯𝘺 cat. I want a specific cat similar to my ex's cat. I want a Maine Coon.""

""Well one of them has long hair!"" he proclaimed.

Really...

I paused.

Could this be it? The moment I prayed for?

He took me to his house after dinner, opened the door, and lo & behold-

there was Leo.

Literally, sitting at the entryway soon as we opened.

It was as if he was waiting for me.

We both knew.

The moment I saw him I gasped - 
he looked so similar to my ex's cat.

My friend gave me a treat to give him and said, ""put it on the floor, because Leo won't eat treats out of anyone's hand.""

He ate it right out of my hand.

I cried. I called my landlord, went home- and within a few weeks...

I officially adopted my Leo.

This is not just any story, this is the power of prayer, patience, and true manifestation. I knew that God had me, I just had to wait for the moment. And May 15th of 2021 -

that was it.

We're going 5 years strong now me and my little guy. 
We've been on trains, planes, and automobiles together.

Leo has stayed with me all across the country, in over 15 different hotels and AirBnBs.

People think I'm crazy for letting him out the door right away anytime we land in a new place. ""Cats can't be confused like that! He'll get lost!""

Nah.

He always comes back.

I know my cat belongs to me,
and I trust we won't ever part.

He's never even had an accident on the road.

I'm blessed lol.

I've taken him to parks with me to run freely.
I've taken him to kava bars to socialize.

I've even left for long stints at a time to travel internationally and leave him in the care of a friend... (which is hard).

but I always come back. 
And he always comes back...

to me.

Let it just be you, and your cat. Or maybe it's a dog. Or maybe it's just that one person...

let that be enough, and go through the tunnel.

No one cares what you sell.

(well - rarely. We'll get to that).

It's more about sharing who you authentically are just as you would meeting someone you vibe with at a bar, a park, at the gym...

In my Circle community I'll often get messages from clients about their day, what's going on, etc... and THEN a separate, more scripted message like ""Okay here's my post"" and I tell them what they just told me casually about their life was actually more interesting than the ""post"" they just wrote.

lol.

I love taking sales calls because people on LinkedIn are so interesting. So many rich stories and because of the platform I've built, people mostly always feel safe to open up to me.

When I take notes on the call and repeat back to them their own story in a format that's optimized for LI & social channels - often times they are stunned.

But this is the real juice that people wanna hear.

This is what's actually relatable.

This is, ironically...

STEP ONE to get people interested in you, to take notice, and then to eventually yes... check out your page and go see more about you and your business.

""I want to figure out a way to work with this person."" is a much easier sale.

It's cuz people just like you...

easy.

It's often the gifted and talented children who are targeted by adults. Their ability to perceive things clearly is a threat to the delusional reality some twisted grown ups would prefer you live inside. 

This is the stage where these gifts first learn it's not safe, and begin to shut down.

Drugs are a great way to assist with that, and also to cope with the grief of having to live as less a version of who you truly are.

Less than 5 months later, she's cancer free.

The craziest thing is only a few months prior, her father Eugenio was also diagnosed with cancer. Her family was already shook. I remember calling him to talk about it but no one saw what was coming next with Alicia...

In September she went into the doctor with abdominal pain and they told her it was cancer. A few weeks later she got the official diagnosis (Metastatic high-grade serous carcinoma) and needless to say, it was not a fun sight to research on that.

I was scared, but I knew she'd be okay simply because of this:

She never freaked out. 
She never said she was going to die.
She never even told anyone they TOLD her she'd die!

& when I asked her, ""So... do you think you're going to heal it?""

She simply replied ""𝘠𝘦𝘴!"" 
& she did not stutter.

I knew then she'd be fine, and her father is almost cancer free as well!

All in a matter of less than a year, and in Alicia's case... less than 5 months.

I share this today to inspire you all, and to also ask for help with the donations.

I am so proud of my amazing friend, who not only went through insanely grueling treatments the past 5 months, lost all her hair, was catapulted into an entirely new life her (and her close family!) would have never imagined...

but she never fed into the fear of death and she even said to me once ""worrying is pointless"" which I know is a huge part of why she's now healed.

I mean heck, this woman started planning her ""cancer free"" party for her and her father technically before they were both even over the finish line!

That's true manifestation in action.

That's a powerful woman.

That's Faith.

& best of all?

𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿.

I'm so proud to have a friend as emotionally strong, spiritually intelligent, and kind hearted as this woman is here.

I love you so much Alicia, and I will never forget the day we met.

yes I own a map of the flat earth.

Before you get all triggered and argumentative - hear me out.

Last year while on a trip in Ireland (the guy I was seeing out there was a flat earther), I decided to google ""flat earth map"". The different theories and maps of what the world ""really looks like"" always fascinated me.

Well, I came across this one and was immediately drawn to it.

I couldn't stop staring. I felt good in my soul looking at it, and I said, ""𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘐 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘴, 𝘐'𝘮 𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵!""

I found it on Etsy, and I tried to get the artist to customize the color palette to better match my decor.

She quickly informed me it cannot be altered, as it is not original rather from a book series authored by a man that goes by ""Nos Confunden"".

...a book series? 😳 Say what?

I research and find this man has a plethora of books, videos, and alleged real testimonials of human beings who were born ""in the land beyond the ice walls"". Tales of what humanity is like beyond the walls, and what it was like here inside before all the FA/ET conquering of our minds, spirits, souls... and before T͟H͟E͟ ͟G͟R͟E͟A͟T͟ ͟R͟E͟S͟E͟T͟!͟

Not gonna lie - fiction or non-fiction, 
this type of read is right up my alley! 🧐

I bought the entire book series...
and I of course bought the map. 🗺️

It's a fun conversation starter when people come to my house. Some are more open minded and curious, some immediately defensive and judgmental that I would own such a thing.

A guy who worked at SpaceX saw it once - and for sure thought I was a kook. But funny enough, after being open to speaking with me for about an hour on the mysteries of the universe, he lightened up. He even ended up admitting... no, he doesn't have definite proof or know 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘯 -personally- that outer space (as we've been taught)... even exists.

AND HE WORKED AT SPACEX! 😆 

That was a great convo, lol.

So, 

is the earth flat?

Honestly, I don't know.

And I'm fine with not knowing. But I will tell you this,

if I was never taught any different, if I never had ""experts"" telling me what to believe... I would damn sure look out at the horizon and tell you, 

YUP -

t͟h͟a͟t͟ ͟s͟h͟i͟t͟s͟ ͟f͟l͟a͟t͟.͟

Sometimes the most obvious answer is right in front of our eyes. I could be wrong, I could be jeopardizing my reputation by even questioning this on here. And really?

who cares.

All I know is that moment I saw this beautiful map out in Ireland, I was undeniably drawn to it and felt this knowing deep in my soul:

""𝘛𝘏𝘈𝘛... is my home.""

I even had dreams about it, and about all the different ""circle environments"" (aka ""planets"") Nos Confunden talks about in his series.

I guess we'll never know?

I'll explain what and WHY... it's crucial to add this to your mix:

a lot of new creators get in the habit of perfectionism and ONLY ever posting scripted, well planned out, and edited videos.

But only ever releasing these on your LI gets stale, almost like doing the exact same workout at the gym over and over. Once in awhile, to increase your overall shape, add in a new sport or something to mix up the vibe... and you'll find in the end your results improve even greater.

That's why sometimes these unedited, unscripted ""on the fly"" posts will outperform even the most intentional, well edited videos.

I decided to get my hair done (again) - and if you're EVER in a point in your business, life, fitness journey... anything that could be defined as a ""before and after""... don't miss an opportunity to shoot content on it!

Good examples of this:

• House flippers
• Hair dressers
• Fitness coaches

Even just the good old fashioned ""10 years later"" posts we saw trending in January w/ people sharing about the 2016 them, vs. now.

Then vs. now always works well, and if you're actively trying to get clients here? Well - show the before and after of your clients since they worked with you! If you don't have a visual, at least tell the story. ""𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘐 𝘮𝘦𝘵 𝘹 𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘺, 𝘢𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘶𝘴 𝘩𝘦'𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘻!"" type format.

For me?

I'm a big personal brand, so a lot of my content is just that. 

Personal.

Even though I'm a content coach, I like to document my own personal journey and what can I say - I have a girly girl side that loves fashion, working out, and pole fitness classes (amazing for upper body strength!). 

So when I went to get my hair dyed last Friday morning I setup my tripod, filmed a few of these ""non talking"" clips to just show the expression on my face. I had an idea for what I'd say, but just focused on shooting a couple of options and collecting enough footage.

Then (𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘬𝘦𝘺!)-

I made sure to leave the tripod in the EXACT SAME PLACE and even put tape on the floor. Came home, same shirt, different lighting as the day had passed, but I did the hair flip clip a few more times and viola-

loaded the two clips into premiere to find the best matching, and of course added my little ""thoughts in my head"" insert, plus some good old' Megan Thee Stallion.

I use fast motion and slow motion to time my videos.

Everything I edit is in premiere. (I like manual).

The biggest advice I can give any creator though, and I often have to remind this to myself, is the MOMENT you think of the idea (provided it's low production, of course)....

do it.

Don't overthink it, just film it.

You wouldn't believe the amount of times I feel so dumb filming content and doubt myself like ""ugh why am I doing this? this is so stupid.""

Somewhere in the process, usually in the editing, I start to finally like it.

But it takes time.

Feeling dumb is not a sign you shouldn't be doing it.

Just do it!

In fact… there are parts of marketing I completely suck at. 

But here's the plot twist:

People kept hiring me anyway.

They joined my programs.

They showed up for my content.

They kept coming back.

Why?

Because I am real.

Because I am safe.

Because I am me.

After working with countless CEOs and professionals, there's one theme I can't ignore:

Too many people are programmed to believe they're not enough just as they are.

Not polished enough.

Not smart enough.

Not worthy enough to show up without a filter.

But let me tell you something—my success didn’t come from a perfect strategy.

It came from courageously showing up with my imperfections on full display.

No masks. 

No fluff. 

Just truth.

And that truth? 

That authenticity?

THAT is what people are craving.

Not another guru. 

Not another funnel. 

Just someone who gets it.

So if you're sitting there thinking you're ""too much"" or ""not enough""...

You're just right.

Your realness is the only strategy you need.

I know a guy who hasn't even HAD A PHONE in almost 2 years. He still is tied to communication means through his laptop and actually works online / with ai / and is big in digital marketing.

Just said when he's done with work, he closes his laptop and that's that.

No connection.

Only him and his wallet, walking about.

I'm sure many of you on here remember the times...

for my generation, not so normal. And he's close to my age.

It's okay to feel not from this planet-

you probably aren't. Sometimes reminding myself I'm just here on a mission and not to take it all so seriously is what roots me to just be and get through the day.

Truly free?

Before the world told you to quiet down, sit still, and dim your light?

Somewhere along the way, you lost a piece of yourself.

Not on purpose—

It happened in a moment so quickly, you may not even remember it clearly.

You were playing, singing, creating… just being.

No fear. 

No filter. 

Just joy in motion.

And then, someone said something—

A look, a laugh, a comment meant to “correct” you.

That was the moment you learned:

🔇 “Maybe it’s safer to shrink.”

🛑 “Maybe being me isn’t okay.”

And so you built walls. 

You edited yourself. 

You dimmed.

That’s how the filter got installed.

But here’s what you need to know:

That moment was never a reflection of your worth.

It was a reflection of their discomfort.

Here’s your reminder:

You don’t need to keep carrying someone else’s judgment like it’s your truth.

So try this:

Remember the moment. 

Not to relive it, but to reclaim it.

Forgive yourself for hiding. 

You were just trying to feel safe.

Reconnect with that unfiltered, magical version of you—

The one who laughed loudly, created freely, and felt everything deeply.

That version still exists.

It’s just waiting for permission to step forward again.

And guess what? 

You’re the only one who can give it.

my favorite.

✅ Takes 5 minutes
✅ Measures 5 key traits
✅ Gives you a crazy accurate report

Simple. Fast. And honestly, a game-changer for hiring, managing, and understanding your team (or yourself!)

So they write it off, they don't even start.

But the reality is there's so many different flavors and avenues to blogging. It doesn't look the same for everyone and it's important to consider that if you've just written it off as ""not for you""... you're probably looking at the majority or ""normal"" strategies and thinking you'd have to do it the same way.

You don't.

I love the look in my client's eyes when they realize what they pictured in their head they'd have to do (and truly, often dreaded) does NOT have to be the case.

Blogging is a lifestyle, we work it around the individual.

Tailor made.

The reality is getting your face out there is undeniably going to bring you more opportunity, and business.

The question is how do we do it in a way you're comfortable with, feel excited about, and can sustain year after year? (and yes - this is a years long journey. No one goes viral overnight).

If you're on the fence and needed a sign, perhaps this is it.

When people scroll, they see your name. 

They see your job title. 

So why are you wasting those first precious seconds repeating what they already know?

Instead of:
❌ ""Hi, I'm Susie Hawkins, and I work and travel...""

Try this:
✅ ""I almost missed my flight, but it turned into the best networking opportunity of my life!""

See the difference? 

The first one is forgettable. 

The second one? 

Instantly hooks your audience.

Social media isn't a formal introduction—it's a storytelling platform. 

Start with the climax, then fill in the details later.

The journey of working with her and other creators, such as rockstar KayVon Nejad have taught me the power of storytelling on a whole new level.

I have been coaching on LinkedIn on and off, for years. But I'll be honest-

I never really liked helping people.

It's not that I disliked it - it's just that I couldn't find the joy and ease in running a business.

I was too wrapped up in survival mode and taking care of myself.

I had crippling fears about losing what I'd built, running out of money, and my childhood fear of abandonment seeped into my work, ironically energetically just pushing more and more clients away.

The past couple years firing most of my staff to take the reigns and do everything myself for a change (coaching, sales calls, client management) has allowed me to finally build the self esteem to trust I CAN DO IT and I don't need to outsource what was really, always my personal gift all along.

If you have a story you want to share, but don't know how, I am looking for 2-4 more clients I can help skyrocket their engagement, and grow their brand on LinkedIn.

Message me on LinkedIn or book a call on my website.

Thank you all for accepting and allowing me to share my journey so candidly with all of you over the years.

I have grown a lot, and I'm so grateful.

becoming a blogger.

I thought I was just making videos for the sake of getting leads on LinkedIn and hopefully, growing my marketing business. And yes-

that happened.

But I never would have expected the plethora of personal development that ensued from dropping that first video, and taking the brave step to put myself out there as a content creator.

Having to read remarks from hateful people in the comments. Going through phases of defensiveness, then self curiosity and inquiry, and sometimes even coming to agree with and appreciate my haters for helping me grow.

The recognition of my brand growth leading to podcasts, Forbes features, speaking engagements, and pushing me into other territories of my career I was in no way expecting.

The ability to do brand deals, and get paid directly to promote products, hotels, and other businesses on my page.

The added confidence I gained in sales, and as a leader in business in general. Being less afraid to face people on camera, since I was already building a muscle to do that so regularly online.

More than anything,

dropping the act that I need to ""be"" buttoned up and professional in business... 

to get business.

I͟t͟'͟s͟ ͟t͟h͟e͟ ͟o͟p͟p͟o͟s͟i͟t͟e͟.͟

My decision to grow an authentic brand has established me as exactly WHO I AM and what I stand for. When I get on sales calls with prospects they 1.) already know me (𝘸𝘢𝘺 𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘦) and 2.) already like me and what I stand for (𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘵).

𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 = 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴.

I pick and choose the jobs I want to do now. The podcasts I want to go on, the speaking engagements that feel in alignment... and while yes every business owner has to go through that YES phase of just doing everything they can to get connections, accounts, and revenue...

if you grow a blog i͟n͟ ͟t͟a͟n͟d͟e͟m͟ with this hustle period of your career, you will arrive much faster to the phase of CHOICE & FREEDOM. Which grants you with way more opportunities to do & sell... basically whatever you want.

(Pro tip: it's much more fun here 😉)

People are here for YOU! the r͟e͟a͟l͟ ͟y͟o͟u͟. Not the business.

And that's why you should be a blogger.

But if you’ve never told your audience what you actually offer — you’re leaving money, impact, and opportunities on the table. 

Here’s the truth:

👉 People are not mind readers.

👉 If they have to guess what you do — they won’t.

👉 And if you never sell, they’ll assume you’re not open for business.

💡 Advice?

✅ Be clear about what you sell.

✅ Be direct at least once a week.

✅ Yes — be a little “salesy” sometimes. 

Sprinkle it in. 

Make it fun. 

Make it YOU.

The thing is, when we die, we really DON'T know where we go. Or where exactly we came from in the first place.

That's why religion calls it FAITH!

You are guessing, you are betting on this idea that there was something before. Maybe you planned it out with your alien soul family as illustrated in today's funny. Maybe you were birthed directly from an almighty God and had no say in the matter.

Maybe when you die you go back to said Alien fam, and have a good laugh about what a crazy trip that was. Or maybe you go to a magical place we like to call ""heaven"" to live with Jesus.

Or maybe you just cease to exist - 

and that's an unsettling thought.

For me?

I choose the faith.

Faith that there's something far greater on the other side and we're merely in a little simulation we created for ourselves. The point is TO feel like it's all there is. The point is TO feel stress. Emotions. Overwhelm. Pain. Joy...

oh the plight of being a human.

It's not forever, and my faith is likely a mix of many in the world. I love and follow Jesus, I believe in Aliens, I have personally remembered past lives already, and I do believe we choose our own parents for a divine reason, to learn and evolve as a soul... so we can eventually become like Gods.

If you're still posting boring company updates, vague ""life lessons"" without any real life examples from your own story to share... I'm not surprised people are scrolling on past.

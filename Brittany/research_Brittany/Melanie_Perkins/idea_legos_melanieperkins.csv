I used to work seven days a week, barely pausing to breathe, thinking it was the only way to succeed—but I’ve since realized how unsustainable that was. 

Social media is quick to glamorise working all hours and pushing through without taking breaks. In recent conversations with founders, I noticed a common theme: they’re so focused on achieving their big goals that they’re leaving nothing in the tank for themselves. One founder told me they worked through every weekend last year, taking just a handful of days off. Another shared how they felt completely stuck after a setback, without tools to navigate the emotional toll.

I could relate. For years, I had no tools either. I’ve spent the last few years working on that, and now, I feel like I have the tools to help me recharge, reset, and plan effectively. I thought I’d share a few of the things that helped in case they’re helpful for you too.

#1: Taking Real Breaks
For years, I didn’t take weekends off. Now, I intentionally carve out time to recharge. Giving myself space to pause has been transformative—it helps me reset and approach the week ahead with clarity and energy. Contrary to what I originally thought, taking breaks helps me to ‘work smarter, not harder’.

#2: Setting Walking Goals
A few years ago, I challenged myself to walk 100 km every month. It was a game-changer. Those walks became my thinking time, a chance to brainstorm, reflect, get some exercise and time in nature. This year, I’m excited to bring that habit back—it’s something I’ve missed and can’t wait to reintroduce into my routine.

#3: Meditating Every Day
Meditation didn’t come easily to me. I’d sit there thinking about work instead of relaxing! But over time, I’ve found it incredibly helpful. I use the Calm app for 10 minutes before bed, which clears my mind and improves my sleep. It’s also helped transform my inner self-talk, making me kinder to myself.

#4: Experimenting with AI Walks
This year, I’ve started combining my walks with AI tools. I use AirPods to record my thoughts and then let AI organize those ideas into actionable steps (yes, in Canva!). It’s been surprisingly effective at turning big-picture brainstorming into tangible progress. I’m excited to see where it goes this year and to continue to refine it.

#5: Building Simple, Intentional Habits
Small ‘rituals’ like journaling for five minutes each morning, spending time in nature or keeping a consistent bed time and wake time (one of my 2025 goals!) can make a huge difference. 

I certainly don’t have it all figured out—I’m still learning, and these habits are evolving. But I’ve noticed how much better I feel when I make time for myself, and I wanted to share in case these ideas resonate with you too.

What habits or tools have made a difference in your life? I’d love to hear what’s worked for you too! 🌟",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melanieperkins_as-we-enter-2025-ive-been-reflecting-on-activity-7281870969856532482-3ir5?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFExDSABRCfDps2vz8BwL3pcxWzy6fiDV8g

It’s been incredible to see crazy big goals that we have set being turned into reality to be used by millions of people - but there’s one in particular that really stands out, dating back to the very beginning of Canva when we had the good fortune of meeting David Hearnden and somehow convinced him to join the team as our CTO.

Since that day, Dave has been dreaming about launching simultaneous collaboration in Canva (multiple people designing together in real-time). It was a goal so ambitious that he vowed to forego cutting his hair until we made it possible.

Launching simultaneous collaboration in Canva was an absolutely massive feat – it involved many years of engineering effort and doing many ‘world firsts’. So when we officially unlocked this milestone, Dave had a ceremonious haircut and we created a little film of the occasion to celebrate internally but thought we'd share it here for a bit of fun!",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melanieperkins_building-canva-has-taken-the-hard-work-passion-activity-6787910082509324288-Ooyz?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFxp7sYBfVjWhnJhDnuArU5YimZaRl1k-2w

I’ve joined the PR team for “Imagination.”

You might be wondering, why does imagination need a PR team? It's not a company? Well, lately, imagination has had a bit of a PR problem.

“It’s just in her imagination.”
“It’s not realistic.”

Sound familiar? That’s exactly the issue. When imagination gets dismissed as naïve or unrealistic, we stop taking it seriously, even though it’s the single most powerful force shaping our shared future. One to be taught, honed, valued and refined.

If we don’t imagine the world we want, how can we possibly create it?

A couple of months ago, while preparing for our keynote, we started listing moments when imagination reshaped reality, times when what once seemed absurd became our new reality.

When the world was bound to the ground, the idea of flying was madness.
When nights were lit by candles and oil lamps, the thought of brightening a room with the flick of a switch was pure fantasy.
When sickness was seen as destiny or divine will, the idea of curing it through science was unimaginable.
When half of humanity was voiceless, the idea of women voting was radical.

And yet, someone imagined each of those things first. And then many people worked hard to turn those completely “unrealistic” ideas into the reality we now enjoy today. Everything good was once imagined.

It made me wonder: what are the things you’re most grateful for today that were once just imagined? And what’s the next “impossible” thing you hope we’ll imagine into reality?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melanieperkins_i-feel-like-i-just-got-a-new-job-a-pretty-activity-7394315980769980416-SnNR?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFExDSABRCfDps2vz8BwL3pcxWzy6fiDV8g

We have a crazy big dream: that by the end of our lifetimes, everyone on this planet will have their basic human needs met. It’s terribly sad that this is still considered a crazy big dream, but thanks to the support of our community, the Canva Foundation is committing another $100 million USD to support people living in extreme poverty to take another step towards this.

Since 2021, our partnership with GiveDirectly has provided $50 million in direct cash transfers to more than 85,000 people in Malawi. Families have used this support to send children to school, access healthcare, start small businesses, and invest in livestock and tools that help create long-term security. Each story is different, but all prove a simple truth: when people are trusted to decide what they need most, the impact is extraordinary.

This new $100 million commitment will reach another 185,000 people, helping families transform their lives, while creating ripple effects that strengthen entire communities. It is, without a doubt, the best money we could ever imagine spending.

We’ve created a short documentary from journalist David Begnaud's visit to Malawi: https://lnkd.in/gpDpkW8h

For the first time, we brought together more than 3,000 of our Canva team from across Australia and New Zealand under one roof where we unveiled the Canva Creative Operating System, our biggest product launch yet. 

It brings together an upgraded visual suite with Email Design, Forms, and Video 2.0; a powerful new Canva AI layer; Canva Grow, Brand System and the all new Affinity! 

We believe we’re entering a new chapter, the Imagination Era, where the best breakthroughs come not from just how much we know, but by what we can imagine and then create together.

At the end of the keynote, I wore a jacket with what’s now one of my all-time favourite quotes: “Everything good was once imagined.”

Jimmy Knowles imagined that jacket while having a salt float… and then there I was, on stage, wearing what he had imagined.

The week itself was imagined by an incredible crew who brought every detail to life, from the Canva Express train that carried our team to the event, to all of our product launches imagined by so many across Canva, to every detail of the staging, keynote and the week of festivities, even the wishes for new features were imagined by our community around the world.

It capped off the Canva World Tour, where our teams set off around the globe to meet and teach our community in 40 cities, 30 countries, and with 250+ workshops. 

It was imagination made real, over and over again. And captured what we believe to be true: imagination is the most important skill we have.

One of those people is Lars Rasmussen, who has had a profound impact on Canva from our earliest days.

Before Canva had a single line of code, before we even had an engineering team, he generously shared his wisdom, helping me understand the extraordinarily strong engineering talent we needed to bring our vision to life. We dreamed about the future together, and his guidance played a pivotal role in helping us to get started.

Beyond Canva, Lars had left an undeniable mark on technology we’ve come to know and love as the co-founder of Google Maps, he helped change how we navigate the world. Now, he’s channeling that same ambition and energy into building a thriving tech scene in Greece. He believes a massive tech festival could help ignite the movement, and I couldn’t agree more!

When he invited me to speak, I couldn’t say no. The only catch? The event is on the other side of the world, and with other commitments, I couldn’t be there in person. But in true Lars fashion, where challenges become opportunities, we decided to push the boundaries and experiment with new technology.

So, I’ll be there – via hologram! Excited to see how it all comes to life, and to speak to the next generation of founders out there 🚀",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melanieperkins_tickets-are-now-open-be-part-of-the-first-activity-7305556453342265345-5E5i?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFExDSABRCfDps2vz8BwL3pcxWzy6fiDV8g

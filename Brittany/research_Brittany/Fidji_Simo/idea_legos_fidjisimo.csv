The last two years have been a wild ride, but I’m really proud of the business this team has built, turning us into an enduring and profitable company that delivers a critical service to millions of people. 

None of this would have been possible without the early days determination and grit of our founders - Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo. Thank you for the creative spark that founded Instacart and for entrusting me to lead the company’s next chapter.

One of the company values that I’m most proud of is “Grow the Pie” — we are in the business of growing our partners' businesses and when they win, we win. It makes today’s milestone even more sweet as it's a win not just for us but for our retail partners, brand partners, customers, and shoppers. 

Yet, at the same time, it’s just the beginning. My eyes are firmly set on the next 10 years of building technologies to transform the largest retail category in the world. So, while we savor today’s milestone, we’re going to stay hungry and work to create value in the public markets the same way we always have — by lifting others up and growing the pie for everyone.

Below is what I sent to my Instacart team just now, and the link points to Sam’s statement. 

Hi team - I want to share an important update with you that I will be leaving Instacart in the coming months to take on a new role as CEO of OpenAI Applications, leading the product, business, and other company functions. 

Let me start by saying this was an incredibly hard decision because I love this company. We are operating incredibly well as our last earnings results have shown. Our strategy is working and this team is top notch, which makes it very hard to leave. 

At the same time, you all know my passion for AI generally and in particular for the potential it has to cure diseases — the ability to lead such an important part of our collective future was a hard opportunity to pass up. I only feel comfortable doing this because Instacart is on an excellent track and in great hands with a stellar management team. 

I want to be clear that this change is not immediate. I’m not going anywhere for a couple of months. Our board regularly conducts succession planning exercises, and we expect the new CEO will be announced soon and will be an existing member of our management team. I’ll remain CEO and work closely with my successor and our leadership team to ensure a smooth handoff. I’ll also stay on as Chair of the Board to support our next CEO. 

I also want to apologize for how unexpected this may feel. This is not how I planned for you all to hear this news, but a media leak unfortunately expedited the timeline by several weeks.

Leading Instacart and being on this journey with you has been an honor. From resetting growth in the post-pandemic years and proving to the world that we could be profitable, to successfully taking this company public and hitting $1B in an annual advertising & other revenue run rate, to expanding to restaurants and transforming the in-store experience with Caper Carts, and even just this week launching a completely new app, Fizz, in record time  — we have proven that we can take any challenges and turn them into massive opportunities. I’m deeply proud of the work we’ve done together and even more excited about the road ahead. 

Fidji.

I am sharing this essay on why I believe AI can be the greatest source of empowerment for all. https://lnkd.in/gfrq627N 

I’ve always considered myself a pragmatic technologist — someone who loves technology not for its own sake, but for the direct impact it can have on people’s lives. That’s what makes this job so exciting, since I believe AI will unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history. If we get this right, AI can give everyone more power than ever.

But I also realize those opportunities won’t magically appear on their own.

Every major technology shift can expand access to power – the power to make better decisions, shape the world around us, and control our own destiny in new ways. But it can also further concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few — usually people who already have money, credentials, and connections.

That’s why we have to be intentional about how we build and share these technologies so they lead to greater opportunity and prosperity for more people. The choices we make today will shape whether the coming transformation leads to greater empowerment for all, or greater concentration of wealth and power for the few.

We can start by making sure the keys to empowerment and opportunity — knowledge, health, creative expression, economic freedom, time, and support — are widely available. You can read more in the link I shared about the potential AI has to transform each of these aspects of people’s lives.

If we can make intelligence accessible everywhere, affordable to everyone, and easy to understand, we can drive the biggest opportunity engine the world has ever seen and help more people live better lives. I’m looking forward to building this future alongside my brilliant new colleagues at OpenAI, and I’ll have a lot more to share soon.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fidjisimo_openai-activity-7353110769959358464-9s8z?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE8SUUgBx-GWgM3RlL9OxgG4agNJ3pLcPEE

Felipe, a member of our OpenAI team, and his wife Carolina shared their story on today’s livestream, and it really moved me. Last October, Carolina was hit with three cancer diagnoses in one week. Like many, her biopsy results felt overwhelming and confusing. On a whim, she took a screenshot of the biopsy report and put it into ChatGPT. Within seconds, it translated the medical jargon into plain language, helping her feel more in control and more prepared to talk to her doctor about next steps. She’s kept using ChatGPT throughout her cancer journey, even to help make a tough choice about radiation when doctors gave conflicting advice.

Today, I’m thrilled to announce that we’re launching ChronicleBio — a company entirely dedicated to building the world’s best data platform on neuroimmune conditions like POTS, ME-CFS and Long COVID, that affect 250+ millions of people.

I’m honored to be co-founding ChronicleBio with Rohit Gupta and Rishi Reddy, who are the ones running the business full-time. The three of us are patients and caregivers in this space, so we have deep personal commitment to the mission.

For most conditions, like cancer or Parkinson's, critical datasets already exist and have massively accelerated the path to drugs. But for neuroimmune conditions, these datasets are sorely missing, making it hard for biotech and pharma to invest in developing drugs.

The advances we’re seeing in AI make me more confident than ever that we’re on the cusp of being able to cure these diseases. But powerful models alone aren’t enough — we also need rich, high quality, deeply-analyzed biological data that these AI models can be trained or deployed on.

ChronicleBio is here to provide exactly that.
We are bringing together providers, pharma and patients to generate the world’s largest and deepest multi-modal data set for our patient population, with the goal of surfacing new biological patterns, building biomarkers, and ultimately accelerating the path to diagnostics and treatments.

Within months we have already begun launching clinical partnerships, building a scalable data ingestion engine and biobanking infrastructure, generating brand awareness with relevant patient advocacy groups, generating revenue with pharma via a decentralized clinical trial network and assembling a world class mission-oriented team of AI technologists, scientists and healthcare leaders.

This work is personal. Behind every sample we collect, there is a patient suffering, fainting in random places, stuck in bed for years, or living with relentless, invisible symptoms. These conditions are profoundly debilitating — and yet there are still no validated biomarkers, no diagnostics, no cures. That is unacceptable.

This is a long road, but like I’ve said before: I will not rest until these conditions are eradicated. In the meantime, the team at ChronicleBio will build the data infrastructure that will make tomorrow’s cures possible, faster.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fidjisimo_chroniclebio-ai-powered-data-platform-for-activity-7358542320507478018-Visz?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE8SUUgBx-GWgM3RlL9OxgG4agNJ3pLcPEE

Hard things often do. 

After being diagnosed with POTS, I embarked on a mission to find cures for neuroimmune conditions, which are debilitating, and chronically understudied. I asked so many pharma companies why they weren't prioritizing conditions that affect 10s of millions of people in the U.S. alone, and the answer was clear: there simply was not enough high-quality data on the biological mechanisms behind these conditions, preventing pharma from identifying good targets and drugs. 

We decided to change this. In 2023, we proudly opened the doors to Metrodora, a state-of-the-art institute in Salt Lake City, to provide multidisciplinary clinical care for these patients, and allow them to volunteer their data and participate in research.

For two years, we tried everything to make the clinic work. We poured tens of millions of dollars into it, tried to reinvent how care can be delivered, explored every possible business model. Yet we could not find a way to make it sustainable. We offered insurance for everyone to have access, but insurance covers only a very small % of the cost of giving these complex patients the care that they so rightfully deserve. While the clinic was supposed to help fund the much-needed research, all of our funds were spent trying to keep the clinic alive instead, with no hope for sustainability and without being able to live up to the level of care we so badly wanted to give patients. 

This month we made the difficult decision to stop clinical services and to focus entirely on research. Research is critical and cures are what patients ultimately need. Yet I am still very disappointed that we couldn't crack a clinical model to help patients in the meantime, despite our determination. I really hope to see structural changes to the healthcare system, so other people can pick up that fight and make it happen better than we could. 

As for what's next: we’re going back to the core priority of gathering high quality data to understand these conditions better, and we’ve made tremendous progress there. With the right data, AI provides an incredible opportunity to uncover new biological mechanisms. We’re more determined than ever to build the most comprehensive data platform for neuroimmune conditions. We’ll continue to use our clinic as a clinical trial site and partner with other clinics as well. We’ll have more to announce on this soon. 

I'm really hopeful that the advances in AI will allow us to understand biology much faster and accelerate the timeline for cures. Too many patients are living with debilitating symptoms (see article below) because treatments are not coming fast enough. So no matter what the obstacles, failures, bumps in the roads are, I will never stop fighting until we've eradicated these and all diseases.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fidjisimo_ignored-blamed-and-sometimes-left-to-die-activity-7335319297008771075-hqaT?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE8SUUgBx-GWgM3RlL9OxgG4agNJ3pLcPEE

They all said the same thing: there isn’t enough well-characterized patient data to understand these conditions at the biological level, making it really risky for pharma to invest.

At Metrodora Foundation, we’re now closing this gap. Today we’re officially launching MetX, our landmark study and set of data collection tools to collect 360 patient data across clinical data, wearables, biological samples, etc. That way, we’ll get a full view of patients from their genetics to their immune system to their reported symptoms. And with the rise of AI, having the right data sets to be able to leverage all the advances in AI has only become more urgent.

I'm so proud of this work and so hopeful for what it might enable. Let’s go find cures. 

PS: Building these data sets isn’t cheap. Other disease foundations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build these. We believe we can do it much more efficiently thanks to the direct access to patients we have through Metrodora Institute, but every $100-500 you donate means one more genetic test or immune profiling test we can run on a patient, getting us closer to a full mapping of this population.

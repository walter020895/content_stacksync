## 1. PERSONAL INFLECTION POINT

### The Girl from Perth
Melanie Perkins grew up in Perth, Western Australia -- one of the most geographically isolated major cities on Earth. Closer to Jakarta than to Sydney. The opposite of Silicon Valley in every measurable way: no VC ecosystem, no tech scene, no founder network.

**Family background:**
- Father: Malaysian-born engineer of Filipino and Sri Lankan heritage
- Mother: Australian-born teacher named Beverly Perkins
- Grew up in a modest, middle-class multicultural household
- Has a brother named Greg (later lived in San Francisco -- she slept on his floor during pitch trips)
- Her mother was a high school teacher who spent late nights wrestling with Adobe InDesign to lay out the school yearbook -- Melanie watched this struggle firsthand as a child

**University:**
- Studied Communications, Psychology, and Commerce at the University of Western Australia
- Worked part-time tutoring fellow students in design software (Adobe InDesign, Photoshop)
- The tutoring job was the inflection point: she watched students spend entire semesters just learning the tools, never actually creating anything
- She was 19 when she decided to drop out and start a company

### Fusion Books (2007) -- The Practice Round
At 19, Melanie and her boyfriend Cliff Obrecht co-founded Fusion Books -- an online platform that let schools design and publish yearbooks using a drag-and-drop interface.

**Key details:**
- Operated out of Melanie's mother's living room
- Had a massive printer humming in the corner
- Their first customer deposit was $100 -- they couldn't decide whether to frame the cheque or cash it. They cashed it because they needed the money.
- Grew to become the largest yearbook company in Australia
- Expanded to New Zealand and France
- Served over 400 high schools at its peak
- Challenges: technical issues, convincing schools to switch from traditional yearbook companies, massive customer support volume

Fusion Books was the proof-of-concept for Canva's core thesis: design tools should be simple enough for anyone.

### The 100+ Rejections
Between 2010-2012, Melanie pitched the broader Canva vision to investors and was rejected over 100 times.

**The pitch trip ritual:**
- Fly 15+ hours from Perth to San Francisco
- Sleep on her brother Greg's living room floor to save money
- Attend every pitch event, every networking opportunity she could find
- Get rejected
- Fly 15+ hours back to Perth
- Repeat

**Why they said no:**
- She wasn't from Caltech or MIT
- She was based in Perth, Australia -- not Silicon Valley
- Some investors were uncomfortable backing co-founders who were in a romantic relationship
- A 22-year-old woman from the most remote tech city in the world didn't fit anyone's pattern-match
- Her visa expired; she continued pitching from Australia

**The transformative moment:**
Melanie learned that pitching product features wasn't working. When she started sharing her personal story -- the frustration she felt watching students waste semesters learning software -- investors connected emotionally. It reminded them of their own frustrations with complex tools. Only then would she demonstrate that Canva users could start creating basic designs in just two minutes.

### The Naming Story
The company went through an awkward naming phase:
- Originally codenamed "Canvas Chef" -- the metaphor being that users would have high-quality ingredients (stock photos, illustrations, fonts) and combine them like a cooking show
- Melanie described it as "incredibly dorky" but conceptually consistent
- When they couldn't get canvas.com, one of the engineers pointed out that "canvas" is pronounced "can-va" in French
- They dropped the "s" -- like Facebook dropped "the" -- and acquired canva.com in 2012

## 2. THE UNSEXY WORK

### The Kitesurfing Gambit (2012)
This is the story that sounds made up but is entirely real.

Bill Tai, a Silicon Valley VC and avid kitesurfer, met Melanie briefly at a conference in Perth and was impressed enough to invite her to MaiTai Maui -- his exclusive gathering of tech investors and kitesurfing enthusiasts in Hawaii.

**The problem:** Everyone at MaiTai was an avid kitesurfer. Melanie and Cliff had never kitesurfed in their lives.

**The decision:** Melanie taught herself to kitesurf -- a sport she described as "peculiar" and "dangerous" -- because, in her words: "When you don't have any connections, you just kind of have to wedge your foot in the door and wiggle it all the way through."

**What happened at MaiTai:**
- Bill Tai literally made Melanie pitch while kitesurfing
- Through kiteboarding, she met a well-connected investor who introduced her to Hollywood actors Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson
- Both Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson ended up investing in Canva
- The event also led to introductions to Lars Rasmussen (co-founder of Google Maps)
- Bill Tai invested, helping close a $3 million seed round

A 24-year-old Australian woman learned a dangerous water sport to get 20 minutes with investors. That's the unsexy work.

### Recruiting Cameron Adams (The Technical Co-founder)
Melanie is a non-technical founder. The Bill Tai condition was clear: "I'll invest, but only if you find a solid tech team."

Through Lars Rasmussen (Google Maps co-founder), Melanie was introduced to Cameron Adams -- a former Google engineer, designer-turned-engineer who had worked on Google Wave and co-founded an email app. He was a rockstar in tech circles.

**Cameron was initially hesitant.** He turned her down. But Melanie kept having conversations with him, and her passion -- combined with the clarity of the vision -- eventually changed his mind. He joined in 2012 as the third co-founder and Chief Product Officer.

This is a non-technical founder's superpower: the ability to articulate a vision so clearly that world-class technical talent says "I'm in."

### Revenue and Profitability Timeline
| Year | Revenue |
|------|---------|
| 2016 | $4.4M |
| 2017 | $60M |
| 2018 | $84M |
| 2019 | $105M |
| 2020 | $500M |
| 2021 | $1B |
| 2023 | $2B |
| 2024 | $2.7B |
| 2025 | $3.5B |

- ARR hit $4B at end of 2025
- **Canva has been operationally profitable for 7 consecutive years**
- B2B business (companies with 25+ seats): $500M ARR, 100% growth
- 27 million paid users
- 800 million AI tool uses per month (700% YoY increase)
- Hired Zoom's former CFO (Kelly Steckelberg) in late 2024 -- IPO signal
- Blackbird (largest VC investor) told LPs: Canva is ready for a second-half 2026 IPO
- Price hike on Canva Teams: $300 to $500/year -- lifted average contract value by 66%

### What Canva Was NOT
Canva was never meant to be Photoshop. It was never meant to be for designers. The original insight was that 99% of people who need to create something visual are NOT designers -- and the entire software industry was built for the 1%.

This is the "non-technical founder" insight that a technical founder might never have had: the pain wasn't in the tool; it was in the assumption that design required expertise.

## 3. PHILANTHROPY / VALUES (THE CORE)

### The Two-Step Plan (September 2021)
When Canva hit a $40 billion valuation, Melanie published a blog post on Medium that laid out what she called a "simple" two-step plan:

**Step 1:** Become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
**Step 2:** "Do the most good we can."

### The Numbers
- Melanie and Cliff have pledged to transfer **more than 80% of their personal stake** to the Canva Foundation
- Their pledged equity represents approximately **30% of Canva's total value**
- At $40B valuation: ~$12-13 billion pledged to charity
- At current ~$42-65B valuation: the number is even larger
- They are **Australia's second most generous philanthropists**, behind Andrew and Nicola Forrest
- The Canva Foundation costs $641,677 to run over 18 months, and gave away $31.639 million in that period -- extraordinary overhead efficiency

### Direct Quotes on Wealth (Verified)

**On being called billionaires:**
> "It has felt strange when people refer to us as 'billionaires' as it has never felt like our money, we've always felt that we're purely custodians of it."
-- Melanie Perkins, Medium blog post, September 2021

**On how much is enough:**
> "Billions upon billions of dollars is more than anyone needs in their entire lifetime by a longshot."
-- Melanie Perkins, Sydney Morning Herald interview

**On the weight of wealth:**
> "We truly feel like it is a huge responsibility, one that weighs really heavily upon us, and doing the most good we can do is something that we think about a lot."
-- Melanie Perkins, Sydney Morning Herald

**On optimism:**
> "We have this wildly optimistic belief that there is enough money, goodwill, and good intentions in the world to solve most of the world's problems, and we want to spend our lifetime working towards that."
-- Melanie Perkins

**On hoarding:**
Perkins and Obrecht explicitly stated they don't believe in "hoarding money."

- Donations to Afghanistan and Ukraine during crises

**4. Nonprofits**

### The Modest Lifestyle
Despite billions in paper wealth:
- Melanie and Cliff live in Perth, Australia (not SF, not NYC)
- They bike to work / are seen grabbing coffee in the neighborhood like any other couple
- Friends describe them as "low-key, fiercely values-driven, and completely uninterested in fame for fame's sake"
- Cliff proposed in 2019 in Cappadocia, Turkey with a **$30 ring from a local market**
- Melanie has never replaced the ring -- "the gesture and the meaning behind it are what matter"
- They married on January 2021 on Rottnest Island (a small island off Perth) -- intimate, small ceremony
- In their early twenties, they backpacked on a shoestring budget through remote parts of India and Africa

## 4. MICRO-DETAILS (The Human Story)

### The $30 Ring
Cliff Obrecht proposed to Melanie Perkins -- a woman worth billions -- with a $30 ring from a Turkish market. She still wears it. She has never replaced it. This is the single most humanizing detail in the entire story.

### Cliff's Email
After one hard-won early fundraising victory, Cliff sent Melanie an email:
> "You are the best businesswoman in the world, and I am so proud of you. Well done. You WILL SUCCEED. I HAVE NO DOUBT."

This was when they had nothing. No investors. No product. Just each other and a vision.

### The Brother's Floor
When Melanie flew to San Francisco for pitch meetings, she slept on her brother Greg's living room floor. Not a hotel. Not an Airbnb. Her brother's floor.

### The Mother's Living Room
Fusion Books -- their first company -- operated out of her mother's living room with a large printer. Beverly Perkins, her mother, was the same teacher who wrestled with Adobe InDesign for hundreds of hours to make yearbooks. The daughter watched. Then built a $40 billion company to fix it.

### The First $100
Their first customer deposit for Fusion Books was $100. They debated framing it. They cashed it instead -- because they needed the money.

### The Cooking Show Metaphor
The company was originally called "Canvas Chef" because Melanie imagined users like chefs with quality ingredients. It was, by her own admission, "incredibly dorky."

### Daily Life
- Starts the day with a piccolo coffee with one sugar
- Introvert by nature
- Practices meditation, daily journaling, and builds in quiet time to recharge
- Used to work seven days a week; now intentionally takes weekends off
- Records thoughts while walking and uses AI to organize them into actionable steps
- Not a fan of email; prefers Slack, Zoom, or face-to-face
- Still onboards each new recruit individually (now 1,500+ employees)
- "Having lunch together is one of the strongest things you can do for culture" -- Perkins to Smart Company

### Hollywood Money
Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson are Canva investors. They met Melanie through the kitesurfing network. This detail alone is worth a hook.

## 5. POST ANGLES

### Potential Hook Angle 1: The $30 Ring
"A woman worth $6 billion still wears a $30 engagement ring from a Turkish market. She's never replaced it. Melanie Perkins, the CEO of Canva, and her husband Cliff have pledged to give away more than 80% of their stake -- roughly $12 billion -- to charity. Their two-step plan: Step 1, build one of the most valuable companies in the world. Step 2, give it all away."

**Why it works:** The ring is the scroll-stopper. It creates an immediate tension -- billionaire + $30 ring -- that forces the reader to keep going. The philanthropy revelation is the payoff.

### Potential Hook Angle 2: The 100 Rejections
"She was 22 years old, flew 15 hours from Perth to San Francisco, slept on her brother's living room floor, pitched to investors all day, got rejected, and flew 15 hours back. She did this more than 100 times. Today her company is worth $42 billion. Melanie Perkins didn't have the right zip code, the right school, or the right connections. She had the right problem."

**Why it works:** The physical grind of the rejection loop is visceral. Perth-to-SF is not NYC-to-SF. It's the other side of the planet.

### Potential Hook Angle 3: The Mother's Yearbook
"Melanie Perkins watched her mother spend hundreds of hours wrestling with Adobe InDesign to create a single school yearbook. She was a teacher. Not a designer. The software didn't care. At 19, Melanie dropped out of university, started a yearbook company in her mom's living room, and decided to fix design for the other 99%. That yearbook company became Canva. It's now worth $42 billion. And Melanie is giving most of it away."

**Why it works:** The origin story ties the personal (mother struggling) to the product (democratize design) to the values (give it away). Full arc in one paragraph.

## THE SINGLE MOST EMOTIONAL FACT
Cliff Obrecht sent Melanie an email after an early fundraising win that read: "You are the best businesswoman in the world, and I am so proud of you. You WILL SUCCEED. I HAVE NO DOUBT." -- This was when they had nothing. No money. No investors. Just a living room, a printer, and each other.

## THE SINGLE MOST SURPRISING FACT
Melanie taught herself kitesurfing -- a sport she had never tried and described as "peculiar" and "dangerous" -- specifically to attend an exclusive investor retreat in Hawaii. Bill Tai then made her pitch the Canva concept while kitesurfing. Through that event, she ended up getting investments from Hollywood actors Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson.

## THE "I DIDN'T KNOW THAT" DETAIL
The Canva Foundation committed $100 million to GiveDirectly in Malawi -- the largest single gift in GiveDirectly's history -- to give $550 in unconditional cash to every adult in an entire subdistrict. The Foundation costs just $641,677 to run over 18 months but gave away $31.6 million in that same period. That's 98% pass-through efficiency.

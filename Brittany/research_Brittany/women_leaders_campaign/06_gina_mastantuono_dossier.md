# BIOGRAPHICAL DOSSIER: Gina Mastantuono
**President & Chief Financial Officer, ServiceNow**

---

## 1. PERSONAL INFLECTION POINT

### Origin Story: Long Island, First-Generation, Age-12 Hustle

Gina Mastantuono grew up on Long Island, New York, with three brothers. College was not a given in her family. She started working at age 12 -- babysitting, then hostessing and waitressing at local restaurants -- and saved that money to put herself through college. She was **the first person in her family to graduate with a degree**, earning a B.S. in Accounting and Business Administration from the State University of New York at Albany (1992).

She chose accounting because a friend described it as "recession-proof." For a kid from a family where no one had a degree, stability was the only career metric that mattered. She was laser-focused on job security early on.

**Direct quote:** "When I graduated college, I never imagined, as a woman, that being a CFO was possible."

### The Heartbreak That Built Her Career

In the early 2000s, Mastantuono was working in New York and up for a promotion. She resigned from her job, gave up her apartment, and packed her suitcases to move west with her boyfriend. **He broke up with her at her empty apartment.**

Instead of calling her boss to get her job back, she bought a one-way ticket and traveled alone for six months. During that solo travel period, she met the man who would become her husband, Luke.

When she came back, she didn't return to the safe path. She took a role at InterActiveCorp (IAC) as an assistant controller -- where her boss was **Dara Khosrowshahi**, then CFO of IAC (now CEO of Uber). Khosrowshahi gave her the career advice she still follows: *"Hire the people who can do your job in two to three years, so you can continue to grow and learn and develop into more."*

**Direct quote:** "It's the hard road and those twists and turns are where the magic happens and where growth happens."

### The Revlon Risk

From IAC, she went to Revlon in 2007 -- when the stock was trading at **$1**. She walked in for an assistant controller interview and walked out with the job of **International CFO** -- a role she had zero experience for. She had never worked internationally. She had only done accounting up to that point. The new young CFO took a massive risk on her, and she delivered.

She spent six years at Revlon (2007-2013) as SVP, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, and International CFO.

### Ingram Micro: The $50B Crucible

From 2013 to January 2020, she served as EVP and CFO of Ingram Micro -- a global technology and supply chain services company with revenues north of **$50 billion** but operating on razor-thin margins. This role gave her the operational breadth and scale experience that would make her ready for ServiceNow.

When she moved her family from Revlon to Ingram Micro, her kids were two and five years old. **Her husband Luke gave up his job in the city to support the move.**

### ServiceNow CFO: January 1, 2020

Gina Mastantuono joined ServiceNow as CFO on January 1, 2020 -- weeks before the pandemic hit. She was new to the software industry. Her boss, Bill McDermott, was also new to the company. Neither had all the answers.

**Direct quote:** "We're not supposed to know everything. We're supposed to know when to ask for help."

### President & CFO: January 2025

In January 2025, Mastantuono was elevated to President AND CFO -- a dual role that is extremely rare in corporate America. She now oversees global strategy, strategic finance, accounting, corporate strategy, venture initiatives, risk and compliance, investor relations, tax & treasury, procurement, real estate, and M&A. This promotion positions her as a potential future CEO.

Fortune placed her on its inaugural **"Next to Lead"** list -- spotlighting executives most likely to ascend to the CEO chair.

## 2. THE UNSEXY WORK

### The Numbers: $50B to $200B Market Cap

Since Mastantuono arrived in January 2020:
- **Market cap**: ~$50 billion to **$200+ billion** (4x)
- **Revenue**: ~$3.5B to **$10.6 billion** (26% CAGR from 2020-2024)
- **Employees**: ~11,000 to ~26,000
- **Stock price**: Nearly tripled
- ServiceNow made its **debut on the Fortune 500** in 2023
- 2025 revenue guidance: **$12.7 billion** at 32% free cash flow margin
- ServiceNow is one of only a **handful of software companies ever to cross $10 billion in revenue**

**Direct quote:** "I've had a front-row seat for what I think is one of the most remarkable growth trajectories in enterprise tech."

### The Element AI Bet (2020)

One of the first acquisitions Mastantuono greenlit when she arrived at ServiceNow in 2020 was **Element AI**, which brought 100+ AI scientists into the company. This was years before the generative AI boom. That acquisition enabled ServiceNow to launch **Now Assist** (GenAI across its platform) on September 30, 2023 -- the **fastest-selling new product in the company's history**.

Now Assist surpassed $250 million in average contract value, with a projected **$1 billion contribution by 2026**.

**Direct quote:** "We 100% wouldn't be where we are today without that acquisition and those incredible engineers really helping build the foundation of AI into our platform."

### Customer Expansion Over Acquisition

70% of existing customers increased their investment. Net expansion rate: **120%**. Over four years, customers with contracts exceeding $5 million grew their contracts by an **average of 40%** through upsells.

### The Zero-Layoffs Decision (2023)

When tech companies were laying off tens of thousands of employees in 2022-2023, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott announced **"absolutely no layoffs in 2023."** The strategy behind this was Mastantuono's: she pulled back on hiring early when she saw macroeconomic warning signs, then partnered with Chief People Officer Jacqui Canney to fill **1,500 open positions through internal talent mobility** -- existing employees moving into new roles.

**Direct quote on early sensing:** "We pulled back on hiring pretty early last year, when we started seeing things in the market that I was concerned with."

### Earnings Call Style

Mastantuono is known for **precision with candor**. She translates complex financial moves into plain language. She is not afraid to say "we don't know" on earnings calls -- a rarity for CFOs. Her guidance philosophy: "reflects real-world complexity and bake[s] in a healthy degree of conservatism."

**Direct quote on risk:** "If CFOs don't take smart risks around investments that drive new innovation, we risk being left behind."

## 3. PHILANTHROPY / VALUES

### $100 Million Racial Equity Fund

In January 2021, ServiceNow launched a **$100 million Racial Equity Fund** -- a Mastantuono-driven initiative to fund homeownership, entrepreneurship, and neighborhood revitalization within Black communities across 10 U.S. regions. The fund is managed by RBC Global Asset Management and buys loans from local community banks, enabling them to extend more credit to minority communities.

**Direct quote:** "Diversity, inclusion, and belonging are essential to who ServiceNow is, how we'll grow, and how we'll innovate."

### Women@ServiceNow

Mastantuono serves as **co-executive sponsor** of the Women@ServiceNow belonging group. She specifically aims to be the role model she didn't have when she started in a predominantly male finance industry.

**Direct quote:** "I got there by pushing the envelope and getting outside my comfort zone."

### ESG as Revenue Strategy

Mastantuono doesn't position ESG as a cost center. She positions it as a revenue driver. On the CFO Thought Leader podcast, she used the phrase "punch quite a bit above our weight class" when discussing ESG opportunities.

**Direct quote:** "Our products can help our customers in their ESG journeys in a way that those of many other companies just can't."

### "Heroes That Inspire Me" (LinkedIn Article)

In a LinkedIn article, Mastantuono wrote about a heart-to-heart conversation with her son about what defines a hero -- "someone brave, courageous, thoughtful, and selfless." They discussed teachers, parents, soldiers, farmers, and service animals, concluding that **"not all heroes wear capes and have only two legs."** She connected this to being inspired by the teams behind the Racial Equity Fund.

### Mentorship Philosophy

She advises young professionals: *"Raise your hand for opportunities and take on stretch assignments. It doesn't mean you'll get every opportunity, but it shows hunger to stretch to your manager."* And: *"Get your head out of the books and learn every facet of your role."*

Favorite quote (attributed to Ginni Rometty, former IBM CEO): **"Growth and comfort do not coexist."**

## 5. CONNECTOR BRIDGE: ServiceNow x Stacksync

ServiceNow is a **Stacksync connector** (Business productivity and collaboration category). Stacksync offers a true two-way sync integration with ServiceNow, supporting both standard and custom objects across 700+ pre-built connectors.

The financial decisions Gina Mastantuono made shaped ServiceNow into the enterprise workflow platform it is today:
- The **Element AI acquisition** (2020) created the AI foundation that makes ServiceNow's platform sticky and expandable
- The **customer expansion strategy** (120% net expansion rate) means ServiceNow keeps growing within enterprises that already use it -- exactly the kind of customer that needs a sync tool like Stacksync
- The **no-layoffs talent mobility** approach (1,500 internal moves) was powered by ServiceNow's own platform -- proving the product's operational value
- ServiceNow's growth from IT-only to **cross-enterprise workflow platform** (HR, customer service, finance, legal) is what makes it a high-value connector for Stacksync's ICP

## POST ANGLES, EMOTIONAL FACTS, SURPRISES

### 3 Potential Hook Angles for a LinkedIn Post

**1. The Empty Apartment**
She quit her job, gave up her apartment, packed her bags to move west with her boyfriend. He broke up with her at her empty apartment. She didn't call her boss back. She bought a one-way ticket anyway. Five years later, she was an International CFO. Twenty years later, she's running a $200B company.
*Angle: The path to the C-suite doesn't start with a promotion. Sometimes it starts with a breakup and an empty apartment.*

**2. The Babysitter Who Built a $200B Company**
She started babysitting at 12 to save for college because nobody in her family had ever gone. She chose accounting because a friend told her it was recession-proof. She never imagined becoming a CFO because she'd never seen one who looked like her. Now she's President and CFO of the 5th-largest software company by revenue.
*Angle: The kid saving babysitting money to pay for college is now the woman who greenlit the AI acquisition that made ServiceNow a $200B powerhouse.*

**3. The CFO Who Said "We Don't Know"**
In 2020, she arrived at ServiceNow weeks before the pandemic. She was new to software. Her boss was new to the company. She could have faked certainty. Instead she said the quiet part out loud: "We're not supposed to know everything. We're supposed to know when to ask for help." Five years later: $50B to $200B.
*Angle: The most powerful words a CFO can say are "we don't know."*

### The Single Most Emotional Fact

**Her boyfriend broke up with her at her empty apartment** -- after she had already quit her job (where she was up for promotion), given up her apartment, and packed her life into suitcases to move west with him. Instead of crawling back to safety, she traveled alone for six months, met her future husband during that trip, and the career path she built from that rubble led to running a $200 billion company. The heartbreak was the inflection point.

### The Single Most Surprising Fact

**One of the first things she did as ServiceNow's CFO in 2020 was greenlight the acquisition of Element AI** -- bringing 100+ AI scientists into the company years before the GenAI boom. That single financial decision created ServiceNow's first-mover advantage in enterprise AI. Now Assist became the fastest-selling product in company history. Without that early bet, ServiceNow's $200B valuation looks very different. The CFO -- not the CTO -- made the AI call.

### The "I Didn't Know That" Detail

**She went to interview for an assistant controller job at Revlon (stock at $1) and walked out with the International CFO role** -- a job she had zero experience for. She had never worked internationally. She had only done accounting. The young CFO at Revlon took a massive risk on her, and she delivered. Then, years later, she adopted Dara Khosrowshahi's advice to do the same thing: hire people who can outgrow their role, because that's how you outgrow yours.

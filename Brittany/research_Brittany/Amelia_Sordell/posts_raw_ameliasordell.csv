I've never met someone in a beautiful, secure relationship, gossiping about mine. 

Women, and men at the top do not compete against each other - they collaborate. 

Because surprise, surprise - there is enough business and success to go around for all of us! 

So;

- Share your spotlight.
- Shout your friends.
- Praise your colleagues in public. 

And give your internet besties all the hype they deserve and connect people  together without expecting anything in return. 

Please cheer others on when they win. 

Successful women don’t put others down - they lift people up. 

Because when YOU lift other people, you also lift yourself.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-11-26T07:30:39.783Z,1386,424,14,image,"Five years ago, I was tricked into a “coffee meeting.”
Turned out it was actually a pitch to the entire board.

I walked in with nothing but a notebook.
My competitor walked in with a deck, a demo, and the contract.

I lost the deal - a £50,000 contract - right at the beginning of my business - when I really, really needed the money.

I was humiliated.

Not because I didn’t win, but because I didn’t even know I was playing a game. 

Turns out, my competitor had been briefed properly.
He knew it was a pitch.
He was told who’d be in the room.

I know because he told me himself.

I felt set up.

I was a young, naive woman in brand new industry with a brand new business. 

I spent the next 3 days spiralling.
Rereading every email.
Beating myself up for not asking better questions.
Blaming everyone - including myself for the deal that I felt was ""taken"" from me. 

Then I called a friend, another founder, to trauma-dump, and to be honest to get someone else to feel sorry for me. And I still remember that call today. He said;

""Feel sorry for yourself, or figure out how to win next time. You don’t have time for both.""

That moment changed everything.

Because he was right.

Winners don’t waste time regretting what they didn’t do, they just make damn sure they do it next time.

And I did.

Now I never walk into a room without knowing exactly who’s in it, what they want, and how I’m going to win.

Even if it's ""just a coffee"". 

Hard lesson.
Expensive mistake.
But now I know this game isn't about win or lose. 
It's only win or LEARN.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ameliasordell_five-years-ago-i-was-tricked-into-a-coffee-activity-7399348852891480064-_Vj9?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFExDSABRCfDps2vz8BwL3pcxWzy6fiDV8g

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-02T07:30:09.148Z,1135,187,4,image,"I went back to work just 3 months after having my second baby. 
Truthfully, I wore that quick return like a badge of honour.
I thought it made me look like I had my sh*t together. 

That I was mature.
Smart.
Valuable enough to be able to have a baby, whilst managing a 18 month old and get right back to work. 

And crushed it. 

But actually, I was crumbling. 

I was tired. 
Unsure of myself. 
My confidence was shot and to be honest, like a lot of mothers can relate to... totally lost my identity. 

But I was terrified of being left behind in my career.
So, I went back to work. 

As a result, I completely overwhelmed. 

I missed out on moments at home.
Missed targets I'd set myself at work.
And felt totally depleted.

I had nothing to give anymore.
But most importantly I had nothing to give myself, anymore. 

There is no RIGHT time to go back to work after a major life event, if you can afford to make that decision. 

But there definitely is a wrong time. 
 
Be kind to yourself. 
Listen to your body. 

Outsiders might think you look like Superwoman.
But there aren’t any real life medals for wearing that cape.

If we haven't met before, hi - my name's Amelia. I built a $4million revenue business off the back of my personal brand, now I post content about how you can do it, too.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-11-21T07:30:10.904Z,1036,252,14,image,"If I was a man, starting a business in 2026 - here is what is exactly what I'd do ↓

1. I’d pitch before I was ready.
I wouldn’t wait for the perfect deck or airtight strategy. I’d start talking about the idea, asking for feedback, getting in the room - because clarity comes through action, not perfection.

2. I’d launch a waitlist before I built the product.
I wouldn’t waste months building something no one asked for. I’d write the landing page, collect emails, test messaging - and build based on what people actually want.

3. I’d say my prices with my chest.
Not a nervous shrug. Not “let me know if that works.”
I’d say it, shut up, and let them say yes. Then I’d raise them every year - because I believe in what I deliver.

4. I’d post about my wins.
Big ones, small ones, messy ones. I wouldn’t wait until I had the “perfect result.”
I’d bring people with me on the journey - that’s how trust is built.

5. I’d show up as me.
Not just as “the founder of X.” Not hiding behind a logo or brand voice.
But as a real person people connect with - because that’s what makes you unforgettable.

6. I’d build in public.
I’d share what’s working, what’s failing, what I’m figuring out.
Because transparency builds trust. 

7. I’d network with people doing better than me. 
Because if you only stay in rooms where you feel safe, you’ll never grow beyond your current level. I’d ask the bold questions. I’d follow up. I’d play bigger.

8. I’d ask for help.
Without shame. Without feeling like I need to “prove” myself first.
Because asking for help isn’t weakness - it’s strategy.

9. I’d take up space.
On Zoom calls. In pitches. On panels. Online. I wouldn’t shrink myself to be digestible. I’d speak clearly, confidently - and trust my voice was worth hearing.

10. And I’d do it all without apologising.
No over-explaining. No softening the message. Just full belief that I belong in this space. Even before anyone else believes it.

BTW this isn't actually about men or women, it's about unlearning the conditioning that told us ALL to wait, shrink, or play nice.

So, have the AUDACITY of a confident guy building a business in 2026. 

Because 2026 is the year you stop asking for permission.
And start backing yourself like an average f*cking CEO... 😉",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ameliasordell_if-i-was-a-man-starting-a-business-in-2026-activity-7397536792436035584-U00N?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFExDSABRCfDps2vz8BwL3pcxWzy6fiDV8g
Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-03T07:30:13.076Z,970,288,8,image,"When my first business went bust, I remember calling my mum telling her I and my dog, Peanut were moving back home. 

I also remember selling my car because I had no money to live or pay to run it. 

My entire identity had been tied to running this business and when it didn’t work out it felt like a death. I spent the next 3 months wallowing in self pity.

It felt like this event had happened to ME. I was the victim. 

It wasn’t until I realise no one was coming to save me from the mess of my own life did I actually begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

That didn’t come easily. 

That came as a very real slap across the face of; I was broke, living with my parents and if I didn’t get my sh*t together no one else was going to do it for me. 

Life has a funny way of teaching you lessons.

Why am I telling you this? 

Well, I’ve been through some of the toughest things someone can experience over the last 10 years. 

- Failed businesses.
- Divorce.
- Lawsuits - at the same time as the above….

Each thing takes a piece of you. 

But there is NOTHING that can’t be figured out. 

- Dead end job. 
- Unhappy relationships. 
- Toxic environments. 
- Unhealed hearts. 
- Debt. 
- Bad credit scores.  
- Voids you think cannot be filled.

... And holes you think you cannot climb out of. 

No matter what dark cloud you’re moving through right now, don’t forget that EVERYTHING is figureoutable. 

Everything. 

And even on the toughest, most overwhelming days, just remember there is nothing you’re going through right now that someone else hasn’t already gone through and made it out the other side.

And I promise, no matter how tough it feels right now - those people are often a better, happier person for it.

If you've just started a business, I know you have best friends in your Instagram stories watching you promoting your business - and do nothing. 

And those same people will happily will like and comment on Kim Kardashians latest selfie. WTF's up with that?!

You’re pouring everything into building your business, your brand, your future - and somehow it’s the strangers on the internet who show up for you the most.

So let’s change that.

I have 250k followers. 
My data tells me 67%+ of them are women. 

Female founders of the internet - let’s actually support each other.
Here’s what to do:

1. Drop a comment below with your name, your story, and what your business does.

2. Don’t post and ghost - scroll the comments, find someone you can help, or someone who can help you, and follow them too.

3. Tag a friend who’s building their business, so they can join us.

Because your friends aren’t your audience - and that’s okay.
They love you, but they’re not the ones buying what you’re selling.

Other women might be.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-21T07:30:15.441Z,907,331,13,image,"My first proper 'job' was recruitment.

You got a phone.
A list.
And a target.

No training. No pep talk. No confidence.

Just: “Dial.”

I sat there making 100 calls a day.
Pitching people who didn’t want to hear from me.
Not warm leads. Not “people who’d shown interest.”
Strangers who were busy, annoyed, or in the middle of their day - and I was the inconvenience.

I got hung up on. 
Laughed at. 
Told to f*ck off. Regularly.

And then I had to call the next number like it didn’t rattle me.

That job didn’t just teach me how to sell.
It taught me how to handle selling.

Everything in life is sales. Not just business.

Going on a date? Sales.
Getting a client? Sales.
Negotiating with your toddler? Sales. 
Asking for a payrise? Sales.
Setting boundaries with friends/family? Sales.
Even confidence is sales - convincing yourself you can survive the outcome.

When I hear someone say “I’m not a sales person,” they usually mean:
“I’m scared of rejection and I’d rather be liked than get what I want.”

That's cool. 
But it’ll cost you.

Cost you whatever it is you actually want. 
Cutting my teeth in sales - in the most brutal of sales jobs - set me up for life. 

Rules I still live by:

1. Do the uncomfortable outreach before you “fix the website”
2. Say the price early so you stop entertaining time-wasters
3. Follow up twice more than feels polite
4. Aim for 10 rejections a week (no rejections = you’re not asking for enough)
5. Treat confidence like a skill, not a personality trait

Every founder should do a stint in sales. 
Because if you’ve never had to earn a ‘yes’ from a stranger, you’re not ready to start a business, yet.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-05T08:00:34.050Z,996,207,4,image,"My friends used to be embarrassed by the stuff I posted on LinkedIn.
They’d laugh at;

- My opinions.
- My videos.
- My advice in posts they didn’t think I had any business in posting.

It would have been really easy for me to stop building my brand on LinkedIn - heck, I’ve been sent screenshots of conversations in WhatsApp chats where people I thought were my friends are ripping my content - and me to shreds...

But I didn’t.

Because I’m not embarrassed by my content. 
I’m not embarrassed by anything I’ve done. 
And I’m certainly not embarrassed by the;

- The $4 million + in revenue generated.
- The 100s + clients I’ve won.
- The amazing brands I've worked with. 
- The most incredible life and the business I’ve built as a result of, guess what? Posting content OTHER people found embarrassing.

You’ve had someone in your ear telling you what you’re about to do is a bad idea - now or perhaps some time ago. 

And they have a right to give you that opinion - everyone has a right to an opinion of YOU.

But don’t let the opinions of other people activate insecurities you have about yourself, and stop you from reaching your goals.

In fact, LET people be embarrassed of you.

Because usually, when people say “you shouldn't” they normally mean “I couldn't”.

My am I telling you this?

The most common message I get from people is about fear of of trying. 

- Fear of trying that business idea and it failing. 
- Fear of trying that relationship and being rejected.
- Fear of asking for that thing and being told no. 

Every knock, failure, win, challenge, obstacle - good or bad - is is merely a plot point for your larger LIFE narrative. You are the writer, producer, director and star of your life. 

Stop making decisions based on whether or not you think you’ll win or lose and just make the damn decision. 

If you fail, you’ll get a great story. If you win, you’ll get a great outcome. 

Either way, you win.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-22T08:00:41.003Z,847,186,11,image,"A few years ago, my business was weeks away from completely imploding. 
I scaled too fast.
Had 17 employees I couldn’t manage.
Clients I was terrified to disappoint. 
And I was mid-way through a messy divorce while trying to keep everything together as a newly single mother for my 2 kids.

I was mentally broken. 
Everyone needed me - I'd promised everyone everything, and now I couldn't deliver. 

I remember sitting on my sofa one night - in the dark, laptop open, staring at my diary, my numbers - and realising there was nothing left to move around.
No clever fix.
No magic solution that was going to save me.

And in that moment, I thought I’d failed.

And I called my friend - who is also a founder.

She said;

“This is the point every ambitious person hits - the one where you think you’ve f*cked it it all up. But it’s also the point that proves you’re actually playing the game. You don’t to compete at the top unless you're willing to risk losing.”

I’ve thought about that conversation ever since.

The thing that you think is going to break you - the revenue, the clients, the employees, the lawsuits - the stress, the burnout, the fear of having to shut it all down - are actually the moments that build you.

Without that season, I wouldn’t have the business I have now.
I wouldn’t have the confidence - or the life and business I love now.
That moment forced me to grow up. 

So if you’re sitting in your own “I've f*cked it all up"""" moment right now -
wondering if you can come back from it - you can.

You just have to keep going long enough to see what it’s teaching you.
Because anyone who’s built something worth having
has also had a moment where they thought they couldn’t.

And the moment that nearly breaks you is usually the one that propells you into the next level of the game.

I run a weekly live - The Branded Show - where we go through brand and marketing tools, tactics and strategies small businesses can use to stand out, get more leads and make more money.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-23T07:30:17.111Z,757,214,11,image,"My girlfriend rang me this weekend, furious.
A client owed her business money.

Not “a bit late.” Weeks late.

At first it was polite excuses:
“Finance is catching up.”
“Just waiting on approval.”
“Paid on Friday.”

Friday came. Nothing.

So she chased.
And the tone changed overnight.

Suddenly the work “wasn’t quite right.”
Then they found “a few issues.”
Then a long WhatsApp arrived at 11:47pm listing problems they’d never mentioned - and ending with:

“We’re not paying until this is resolved.”

Two days later, a legal-ish email.
Words like “breach” and “unsatisfactory.”
A not-so-subtle threat that if she “kept pushing,” they’d “take it further.”

This is the bit that fries your brain. 

They hadn’t raised a single issue during delivery.
They’d approved the milestones.
They’d used the work.
There are even Slack messages to her employees saying how happy they are with the work that was delivered only 13 days before.
They just… didn’t want to pay.

This woman employs 24 full-time staff and has another 40+ part-time.
And still - it felt personal.

So, she did what most good women do when they feel cornered.

She started typing a novel 😂

Explaining. Justifying. Defending.
Trying to be fair. Trying to be nice.
Offering extras to “make it right.”

That’s exactly what the client wanted.

Because some people don’t argue to fix the problem.
They argue to avoid the invoice.

In business, people will try to f*ck you over.
For cash. For ego. For control.

And they’ll bait you into an emotional mess so they can say:
“See? Unprofessional. We can’t pay.”

So, go clinical.

The advice I gave her - and you was;

- Stop debating. Start documenting (dates, approvals, deliverables)
- Move everything to email. One thread. One record
- Respond with facts + next step, only
- Offer two options only: pay + continue, or pay + terminate under contract
- And if they threaten legal, you don’t spar - you say: “Noted. Please send formal correspondence to [email]""

I've had 4 lawsuits since starting my business. 

Some filed by me, some filed by others. 
We've laughed at 1, settled 1, won 1, walked away from the 1 we couldn't win.  Even if we were in the right. 

Unfortunately, this always happens in business. Because in business - like in life, some people are just d*ckheads. 

So make sure you have good contracts, a level head. 

And remember, if someone’s trying to f*ck you over, your feelings are the first thing they’re aiming for.

Don't give it to them.

If you’re going to spend your money on anything in Black Friday, spend it on these 3 tools ↓

1. Planable. 

Scheduling tool. I schedule all of my content from here - you can set specific times, create custom templates, and drag a drop using their calendar feature to fill gaps. I love this app so much - I have it on my phone and do the big scheduling on their desktop version. 

The templates are actually so helpful. I go back 1x per month over the last 3 months of content and review what has done the best and find patterns. I then create templates from those posts like this, while enables me to double down on hooks and formats that work. 

2. SE Ranking

This shows you what keywords are working for your website (and what aren’t), runs competitor website analysis and helps find keywords that actually drive traffic form search engines and AI search. 

It’s not the “sexy” part of building a brand, if you’re relying on your website to generate leads and you aren’t optimising for getting them via search… 2026 will not be your year babe. 

3. SE Visible 

My current OBSESSION. Monitor your name and your businesses’ name in ChatGPT to tell you whether or not you’re being recommended in searches related to your expertise or services/products. 

Possibly the most slept on branding tool of 2025. 

There are a lot of brand sentiment tools out there - almost all are astronomically expensive (and a total waste of money if you’re a small business owner or someone building your personal brand). 

All three are on sale for Black Friday. 

Which I normally think is a bunch of marketing BS - but these are actually things I have personally spent my money on.

And do you know how much I care?

Zero.

Because none of these people are my customers.

None of them are paying my mortgage.
None of them are building my business.
So if someone wants to troll my content?

Honestly, thank you. 🤗 

Every time they comment, they boost the post.
Every time they argue, it gets pushed further.
Every time they try to tear it down, it reaches more people who will buy from me.

Trolls don’t take money away from me.
They make me more. 😂 

Confidence comes from knowing exactly who you’re building for, and refusing to shrink for the people who were never your audience in the first place.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-03T07:30:16.373Z,658,229,11,image,"My first business failed. 
The first of many great, professional f*ck ups. 

It was absolutely devastating. 

I'd tied my identity so closely to being a 20-something Managing Director. 
When I was forced to dissolve it, so did my entire purpose in life. 

I was left to liquidate my stock on platforms like eBay (It was a fashion brand..). Which was more painful than the insolvency. 
Because I'd built up a loyal customer base - selling stuff at a loss was a stab in the heart for me and for them. 

With no income, my dog and I moved back in with my parents with about 26p in my account. 

I remember asking to borrow money to fill up my car with petrol so I could even get back home.

I numbed the pain of my entire identity being ripped away from me with;
alcohol, 
cigarettes and late nights. 

It really felt like a death. And I was grieving. 

My friends did their best to cheer me up.
But was a victim. 
I felt like I’d been really hard done by.

I wallowed in self pity for the next 3 months before I slapped myself around the face and said: ‘You need to go back out and get a job because no one’s going to come and save you.’

I rejoined the workforce in the only career path that didn't judge me for having no experience - recruitment. 

Then spent the next decade trying to rebuild my confidence before launching my agency, Klowt. 

It took me 10 years to grow a pair of balls big enough to go again.
To recover from that wound. 

The failure of that business just killed my confidence… to the point where I was worried about asking for promotions and pay rises, even though I 100% deserved them.

But without that failure, I wouldn't be here.

I wouldn't have;
- Started building my personal brand
- I'd have never founded Klowt 
- I'd not have had the absolutely bloody honour to get to speak to you every day. 

That business failure taught me one of the most valuable lessons I think anyone can learn:

resilience. 

The best lessons that you learn won't be wrapped in victories - they'll be nestled in the losses. 
In the drive it takes to dust yourself off and carry on. 

Success, isn't a constant state of winning. 
It's how you stand back up when life knocks you down, how you choose to move forward when every bone in your body feels like it's set in lead.

So don't do what I did - don't waste 10 years of your life moping around because something didn't work out. 

F*ck ups aren't just part of life.
They're they most valuable part of it. 

So, here's to navigating the f*ck ups. 

Because to be successful you have to make good decisions, but good decision making comes from experience. 
And experience comes from f*cking up.

Introduce yourself to them and start building your own network - right NOW 🚀

Here’s how:

1. Drop a comment below with:

2. Don’t just post and ghost. Scroll the comments, find someone you can help, or someone who can help you, and connect.

3. Repost this post. When you repost this post, people will see your comment. More exposure = more opportunities.

One of the most underrated ways to network on LinkedIn is by commenting on other people's content. When you engage in someone's post, your network sees it. When they respond, their network sees - introducing you to the most amazing opportunity to be seen by exactly who you're trying to attract. 

I’ve:

- Launched a business
- Generated $4M in revenue
- Found two of my best friends in the entire world

… all from intentionally networking on LinkedIn.

So get to work.

When I told my parents I was quitting my “safe” marketing job to start my own business in the middle of a global pandemic, they stared at me like I’d just declared I was moving to Mars.

- I had a small social following. 
- No agency experience. 
- And absolutely NO idea what I was doing. 

Today, we have;

- A community of over 350k people. 
- Generated $4mill in business revenue. 
- Built of the leading personal branding businesses in the UK.
- Work with some of the most influential and recognised thought leaders globally. 
- A business and a culture that is truly a joy to be a part of. 

Betting on yourself is terrifying. 
But staying where you don’t belong? 

That’s even scarier.

So, to the freelancers, founders, consultants, and dreamers out there:
If you’re doubting yourself today, this is your sign. 
Keep going. 
You’re not crazy - you’re doing something most people don't have the courage to do.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-09T08:07:22.224Z,649,202,6,image,"I’ve been thrown from a horse 2x times. 

The first time I was about 10 years old. My grandfathers horse, Annie, bolted at the top of a hill and I was too small to hold on. 

That hurt. 

The second time I was about 13, learning how to show jump. My horse stopped dead on the second jump.

My body did not. 

That hurt even more. 

But the thing that hurt most was the knock to my confidence. The little voice in my head both times that told me that because I hadn’t managed to hold myself on this beast of an animal, I was inferior and therefore should never do what I love to do (ride) again. 

The last time I fell, which would have been around 17 years ago, was actually quite bad. Like, body-bruised-terrified-to-get-back-on-the-horse-the-following-day, bad. 

Did the trainer call my mum and dad? No. 

Did they listen to me wimped and crying about not wanting to jump again? 

No.

They made me get back on the horse. 

Not a peep to my mum and dad. 

Not a single get out of jail free card.

Today, I ride almost weekly and it’s one of the things that brings me so much joy in my life. Joy I have passed onto my daughter. 

I’m telling you this because, we’ve all experienced our own version of being bucked off a horse.

We’ve all tried and failed a;
Job interviews
Dating
Businesses
Careers
Friendships
Marriages… 

In short, life is hard. Failure is inevitable. Pain is guaranteed. And you will suck at 90% of the things you try and accomplish first time. 

Get used to it. It’s all part of your story. And what a bloody great story you’ll have to tell your grand-babies one day when you can tell them all the times life kicked your ass, and all the times you kicked it right back.

Life isn’t about how many times you get thrown off, it’s about how many times you saddle back up. 

Oh, and wear a helmet.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-17T07:30:06.299Z,598,207,8,image,"Years ago, my greatest fear was public speaking. I remember when I did my first speaking gig - it was actually at LinkedIn HQ here in London. 

I remember doing that panel with two other far more confident, far more experienced people.

Heart pounding.
Sweaty palms. 
I thought I was going to throw up. 

I didn't say a SINGLE thing that I'd prepared. 
I stumbled over questions with the finesse of a newborn giraffe.
And if I am really honest, other than photos of the event, I don't actually remember a single thing that happened. 

Now, I do keynotes regularly and am paid to speak on:
Panels.
Webinars.
And do weekly in person workshops - globally.  

Just last month, I had the absolute honour of speaking to a few hundred people at the Sales4Future conference in Croatia. 

I'd like to say that I don't get nervous anymore - I do. 
I thought I was going to throw up, just last week 😂.

The difference is, though, I've reframed that fear into excitement. 

When I get mic'd up to go on stage and began to feel that tummy-turning feeling...  I literally say to myself,
you're excited, you're not scared. 

YOU are excited, not scared.

That is what you need to tell yourself, right now. 

Because one day, perhaps years ago, you dreamed about where you are standing right now. 
You overcame an unbelievable amount of fear to be here. 

You took action to overcome whatever was holding you back because, 
you know, maybe deep down, 
you knew that fear wasn't actually real. 

It exists only in your head, not in reality.

You had those things because you made a scary choice. 

An EXCITING choice. 

I made the exciting choice to walk onto that 1st stage I ever spoke on.
And now my entire business is built on my ability to speak to people both online and off. 

So, stop making BS excuses. 
And START doing more things that scare you. 

Your future will be 10x better if you do.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-15T07:30:07.459Z,580,210,5,image,"4 years ago I pitched an industry figurehead my idea for a personal branding agency. 
He told me -  and I quote - that my business would ""crash and burn"". 

He was worth over £100 million, built and exited multiple businesses. 
He was well - respected.  

He said I'd be better off starting a ""proper agency in marketing... or something.""""

It was absolutely devastating. 

I went into the conversation naively, thinking I was on to something and in the space of about 5 minutes, this multi-millionaire told me I wouldn't amount to anything. 

But it taught me:

When people say YOU can’t, what they usually mean is I can’t.

- ""You can't post on LinkedIn, that's cringe.""
- ""You can't start a side hustle, it won't make any money.""
- ""You can't quit your job in pursuit of your dreams; that will never work.""

Those people fear you.
Because you are doing something *they* never could.

I’ve scaled that business to $4 million over the last few years -  off the back of mine and my teams’ own personal brands.

And that guy went on to appear on Celeb Big Brother 2 years ago... trying to build a brand of his own. 

Taking the first step toward the life you actually want is actually pretty terrifying.

But waking up in the same miserable job 10 years from now, wondering what could have been? That’s f*cking unbearable.

So the next time someone tells you NO - just remember, when they say “you can’t” they normally mean, “I can’t”.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ameliasordell_4-years-ago-i-pitched-an-industry-figurehead-activity-7406234086761181185-FrsQ?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADKktkEBxQzA0yaYzKj2Uk3Srts1R7Mt1nA

But I look back at some of the content that I posted during that time, and if I’m honest, it was so inauthentic. My voice was so far removed from who I really am because I was SO desperate to be liked. 

I’ve come a long way since then. And so has my personal brand. 

Because I’ve realised, there is real power in being disliked. 

- There is confidence. 
- There is self-esteem. 
- There is self worth. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that the success of YOUR personal brand and probably your life, depends on your willingness to be disliked. 

Because a successful personal brand must come from an authentic place. 

And if you’re doing what’s best for other people, you’re never going to do and say what’s best for YOU. 

And I personally didn’t create the kind of opportunities I’ve had - my business, the inbound revenue, the speaking engagements … life-changing stuff, until I realised I had to create a divide somewhere. 

Because everything is subjective. 

Including your opinions and personality. 

Heck, I could say factually that the sky is blue, and for someone else, it’s raining. 

So please, I implore you - STOP watering yourself down to fit in online and off. 

Be 100% ok with the consequences of being yourself. 

Because if you’re not willing to be hated by the people who don’t matter, you’ll never be loved by the ones that do. 

Don't you think?

If you’ve been waiting to “grow your audience” before you start selling - stop.

You don’t need millions of followers to make serious money. I've got a friend who has less than 5k followers and makes over a million pounds a year!

What you need to make content that’s actually valuable to the people who buy what you sell.

If you’re a brow artist in a small town and your videos get 1,000 views - that’s amazing.

Because there might only be 1,000 people in your whole area who even book brow appointments - and you just reached every single one of them.

We get obsessed with views and likes, we all compare ourselves to these huge creators with enormous accounts but YOU don't need an enormous account to make an enormous amount of money, you just need to create content that is specifically designed for who you're trying to reach. 

So the next time you think, “Only 300 people watched that,” imagine standing in a room with 300 potential customers looking straight at you.

A small, focused audience will always outperform a massive, distracted one.

So stop waiting until you “have more followers.”
Start creating content for the people who actually pay you.

Because trust me when I tell you, 100 people watching your content who will actually buy are worth more than 100,000 who just scroll past.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-05T07:30:10.932Z,583,182,10,image,"A 28 year old woman asked me last week, how she should launch her new business. I told her... ""don't"". 

All the advice online tells you to “Just quit your job and start your business.
Go all in. 

I am also one of those """"just f*cking do it"" people! 
But for people like me - ambitious people with bills, kids, mortgages - that’s not advice. That’s an enormous gamble gamble.

So before you go all Thelma and Louise, go work in the industry first.

Pick the main player in the space - the best in the business and go and work for them. 

I spent 6 months selling and delivering personal branding workshops - that made my older employer £2500 a pop, without getting paid a single dime for it because I knew I could trial and test my business idea before I launched it for real. 

That 6 months meant that when I did launch, I closed my first 2 clients in the first week of business. 

I'd never have been able to do that if I had gone all in when i first had the idea to start my own personal branding agency. 

If you want to start your own spa;
Go and work on reception for 6 months. 

You want to start your own social media agency;
Go work for a startup in the space. 

Do this for maybe 6, 12, 24 months. 

- Make mistakes. 
- Build connections.
- Understand how the machine actually runs.
- Watch what works - and more importantly, what doesn’t.

While someone else is paying for it.

Then quit - and do it better.

Why rush to build something from scratch, when the fastest way to build your dream business is to learn how someone else built theirs - first.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-11-20T07:45:53.892Z,558,200,9,linkedinVideo,"How I used to define success:

- A big house. 
- A fancy car. 
- An expensive handbag. 
- Designer clothes. 

How I define success now: 

- Pick my kids up from school. 
- Have time to pursue my hobbies. 
- Take time off to travel. 
- Enjoy my work - and life, every day. 

Most people misunderstand 'success' because our entire lives we've been told that the route to achieving it is through grinding out 80 hour weeks in a job we don't love working for people who don't care. 

As a reformed grinder, trust me it's a fast track ticket to burn-out and depression. 

The happiest and most fulfilled people I know are the people who are people who've build, grown and monetised a business that:

Gives them a consistent income
Allows them to work from anywhere
Gives them the freedom to live a life they love 

THAT is the new definition of success. It's the new 'Rich'. 

I've managed to build a business that generates leads on autopilot, can be delivered from anywhere and allows me to pick my kids up at 3.30pm on a Friday.

I care about feeling it.

Here is how to build a personal brand WITHOUT posting a single thing on social media ↓

1. Go to networking events.

Yes, even those awkward “warm Prosecco in a basement” kind of events 😂. Walk up to people, introduce yourself, connect on LinkedIn. Some of the best business relationships I’ve built started this way - and they still do business with me today.

2. Join founder communities.

WhatsApp groups, Slack channels, any founder networks. Give advice, reply to questions, share your knowledge. You don’t need to post publicly - just be a source of valuable insight, and people will start noticing you.

3. DM strangers strategically.

I DM 10 strangers a month and ask them for a coffee. Reach out to people online who share your values or are doing what you aspire to. Ask for a coffee, a chat, or advice. These conversations not only broaden your network but also position you as someone who’s proactive and genuinely interested in connecting.

4. Be a good human.

Nothing travels faster than kindness. Giving time, energy, advice, and making introductions will get you noticed more than any post ever could. People remember good people, and your personal brand grows naturally when you are one.

You don’t need to post every single day to be well-known and respected in your industry. 

Build real relationships, share your knowledge, and be a good human - and your personal brand will speak for itself.

Trinny Woodall is living proof.

She hosted What Not To Wear with Susannah back in the early 2000's and was a TV star, style icon, and confidence-giver. She made women feel amazing in their own skin.

Then the cameras stopped. And so did her career.

Most people would’ve taken that as a signal to slow down. But not Trinny.
At 52, she started again. 

She built Trinny London, a makeup brand for women the beauty industry ignores: women over 35, spending money, but never in an ad.

- She ignored trends. 
- Ignored rules. 
- Focused on her audience. 

And the results speak for themselves.  

Millions of loyal customers. £70M+ in annual revenue. An army of women calling themselves The Trinny Tribe.

And here’s the thing: it’s not glossy campaigns or perfect tutorials that made it work. 

It’s Trinny being real. 

Smudged mascara. 
Mismatched outfits. 
Tutorials filmed in taxis. 
Every single day, showing up as herself.

Her brand doesn’t sell makeup. It sells confidence. Just like she always did.

So if you’re sitting there thinking: “I’m too old. Too late. Too behind…” STOP.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-30T07:30:12.474Z,528,156,9,image,"State your price, then - shut up.

Every business owner or freelancer has been there.

- You’re on a call with a prospect, you nervously state your price.
- You justify why you charge it.
- You ramble about why it’s fair.
- The prospect states their budget (which is predictably below your price). 
- You give a discount because you need new business and this is the only current option you have. 

Stop. Doing. That.

Here's what you do instead: 

State your price, then - shut up. 

Don't justify it or try to fill the silence. State your price and shut up. 

People feel a need to fill empty space, so the awkwardness will fill the room, and your prospect will need to say something like;

“So… what do I get for that?”

... then you state your deliverables, and again, shut up. 

When you state your price and stop talking, two magical things happen:

a) It shows you're confident about your price and delivery. Which makes you more valuable. 

b) It completely changes the power dynamic with your prospect from customer > supplier to customer <> partner. 

And quite frankly, it stops you from reeking of desperation. Desperation = discount. 

I've closed $4 million in business revenue with this tactic. More when you include speaking gigs, workshops and influencer deals I've signed. 

This works because it’s not about convincing. It’s about setting expectations - You’re not someone they can haggle with, you’re someone they trust to deliver results.

So when you're ready to stop undercharging and start getting paid what you’re worth, state your price - then shut up. 

It works a treat.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-06T08:00:26.343Z,508,170,5,image,"Hey! I’m Amelia.

I was born in Australia.
Raised in West London. 

And aged 13 started an eBay business buying and selling designer clothes I'd found in thrift stores. 

I’ve had 6+ businesses. 3 have failed. 

I f*ck up quite a lot and don’t mind looking like an idiot online when I tell you about it 🤪.

I founded a personal branding company, Klowt. We used to have a team of 17 but I scaled too fast, had 0 idea what I was doing and the whole thing almost imploded in my face. 🥹

I’m a mum to 2 beautiful children. 

I met the love of my life almost exactly a year ago after going through a divorce. 10 months after meeting we got engaged. 

Some days, the pressure to look after the business, my family, making time for my friends and myself - somehow manage to stay hydrated is a lot. 

I love life, and I go through it with 0 expectations, which means I am almost always pleasantly surprised. 

I’m a textbook Virgo. 

I have Labrador energy. When I’m not mumming or working, I’m in the gym, walking, Horse Riding - anything that gets me out of the house. 

I've had a lot of therapy. I think it's like a spa day for your brain. 

I love the ocean. My dream is to have a little cottage by the sea one day. 

I collect historical artefacts. For Christmas, my fiance got me tickets to join a Roman Archeological dig - which we actually did last weekend. 

I actually have loads of really cool hold things (including a Megladon tooth fossil), Roman coins - the most recent addition is a framed letter that Reggie Kray wrote to a journalist from prison.

I love food. 
I hate shopping. 
I'm not a natural blonde... 

I like getting things cheaper than they’re advertised, AND if you gave me $59 million, I’d still be doing what I do because I LOVE doing it. 

I would, however, buy;

- A big fat Georgian Farmhouse in the Cotswolds. 
- An G Wag - Because, why not? 
- And stop paying myself out of my business so I could hire more people to help grow it 😂.

All of these things make up who I am as a PERSON - and, therefore, who I am as a professional. 

And that’s what a social media platform like LinkedIn is about - connecting with people.

So now I’ve introduced who I AM, now it’s your turn.

- Introduce yourself. 
- Tell me something that your LinkedIn profile CAN'T.
- Reply to someone else's introduction so we can all grow together.

3 days later, I posted another video - filmed the exact same way - and it got… 40,000 views. 

Same setup.
Same camera.
Same car.
Same length of video.

Now - most people would obsess over the 40k post and try to figure out what went ‘wrong’.

I didn’t.

Because what you don’t know is almost all of my videos prior to the 200k-er were averaging 5k views.

So, instead of crying over the ones that didn’t do well. I obsessed over the 200k one that did. 

And I asked myself:

Why did THAT one work?
And how do I replicate it?

So we broke it down into the variables:

– the hook I used
– the way I clapped at the start
– whether my hair was up or down
– the exact delivery
– the script pacing
– the edit
– even the length 

And then, for the next batch of content, we kept everything the same except one variable.

Then another.
Then another.

That’s how we worked out that my in-car filmed content, where I clap at the start and is under 30 seconds… goes viral on Instagram. 

It became a formula.

My “Instagram” video system.

A way to replicate success on demand.

Since that first video we’ve had 7 more videos hit over 10k I’m using the same format. 

And THAT is how you grow - not by fixing what flops, but by scaling what worked already. 

Which is literally the whole point of Planable’s new Social Media Experimentation Playbook.

It teaches you exactly how to:

– break down your winning posts
– isolate one variable at a time
– test your hooks, formats, delivery
– track retention + metrics that actually matter
– and build a repeatable content engine

It’s free. And it’s genuinely useful.

And if you want your content success to stop being “random” and start being predictable, you need it.

I suppose that is what happens when you hire smart and ambitious people. 

She’s gone out on her own to start an agency.
And she's already taken on a handful of clients. 

She messaged me last week - “I think I’ve got a client problem.”

She was onboarding all these clients and ended up doing 2x the amount of work she'd contracted to do to service them. 

We had a 30 min session and went through her process, her fee structure and her sales process. 

She didn't have a client problem. 
Her clients loved her. 

She had an expectations problem.

She'd sell a retainer with a clear scope.
Then the client started drip-feeding “tiny” extras.

“Can we add a few more posts?”
“Can you rewrite this one?”
“Can you jump on a quick call?”
“Also… can you do the founder’s page too?”

And she kept saying yes.

Because she’s new. 
And she wants her clients to be happy.
And she’s scared that if she pushes back, they’ll leave.

I know because I was here in 2020 when I set up my own agency. 

But here's the problem with that way of working - you end up doing 2x the work, for the same fee. 
You then resent the client. 
And the client can feel it. 

If you don’t define how you work, the client will define it for you.
And they will always define it in a way that benefits THEM.

So I told her to build what I call the ""velvet rope"" - the guardrails that protect your margin:
- Scope is a fence. Outside the fence = paid. Every time.
- “Yes, and…” is your best friend: “Yes, we can add that - I’ll send a separate quote.”
- Put comms in one place. If it’s in WhatsApp at 11pm, it doesn’t exist.
- Increase your prices like a grown-up: early notice, clear value, no apology.

Planable and I have been working together for 12 months now and they just published a 30 day onboarding guide breaks it down  the A.C.E method - Align, Connect, Execute - plus red flags, scripts, and systems that stop agency scope creep before it starts.

Get it free here: https://lnkd.in/eXVbhwZc 

Most see client onboarding as admin.

But really it’s the moment you set your rules - or you get bullied into playing by your client’s.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-11T08:00:15.997Z,497,123,4,image,"I started building a personal brand for one reason:
I’m lazy.

When I was a recruiter, I would DM the CEOs of companies I wanted to work with.

I’d send them useful stuff:
- what their competitors were doing
- what was changing in their market
- what they were missing

And pretty quickly they’d reply with:

“Wait… how do you know more about my company than I do?”

(Shoutout Google Alerts.)

That opened doors.
Those doors became opportunities.
Opportunities became leads.
Leads became commission.

… but it was stupidly inefficient.

I was nurturing relationships one-by-one.

So I took the exact same insight I was sending privately…
and started posting it publicly.

I posted content about these companies on LinkedIn. 

My reach exploded.
My connections doubled. 
My commissions 3x.
And I accidentally learned the real point of personal branding:

It’s not “content”.
It’s relationships at scale.

If you can connect with the people who matter to your business and create real value for them 1:1, you can do it 1:many.

Work smarter not harder.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-10T08:16:47.003Z,460,140,6,image,"Most people don't fail because they lack talent or intelligence. 
They fail because their ego can't handle the optics of trying before they get good. 

Because “trying” looks messy.
Because learning out loud risks embarrassment.
Because posting the first video, making the first sale, shipping the first draft…
means someone might watch you be average.

So you don’t start.

You don't quit the job. 
You don't start the business. 
You don't post the content. 
You don't ask for the raise - or the promotion - or the sh*t that you know you deserve.

Instead;

You rehearse in private.
You “research”.
You wait until you're “ready”.

And then you call it ""bad luck"" when someone else launches first, or the competition laps you.

The #1 question I get asked in my DM's is ""who did you get the confidence to start?"".

But confidence isn’t the prerequisite.
It’s the byproduct.

The people you admire didn’t avoid looking stupid.
They just decided looking stupid was the price of entry.

So you can be embarrassed. 
Or you can be successful. 

You can't have both. 

So, pick one.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-11-17T08:35:46.464Z,435,160,8,image,"An ex-employer once asked me, ""why do you want to work?""

I was 24 years old.
Just re-entered the workforce after liquidating my business. 
I had a high profile partner - who he wrongly presumed paid for my lifestyle.

I asked him why he'd asked me that question. 
Listened.
Nodded.
Sipped my drink.

Then I said: “Ok, fair enough.”
And walked away.

Not because he was right to ask such a ridiculous question.
Not because I didn’t have a thousand facts, examples and data to fire back with.

But because he wasn’t worth the energy.

When you feel like you're personally being attacked, the default defensive position we tend to talk is attack back. 

Like staying quiet means losing. 
Especially online. 

I see so many people screen grabbing inappropriate messages, calling people out in the comments. 

I've been in a tonne of these situations in boardrooms, on social media - with groups of friends, but let me tell you something; 

Defending how you personally feel about something, doesn't make the other person feel the same way.

Me replying to this ridiculous question wasn't going to make this guy not a sexist. Or any less stupid. 

And spending your precious energy trying to prove your point, or change theirs - is a waste of your time. 

You don’t owe anyone an explanation.
Not for your opinions.
Not for your ambition.
Not for your right to take up space.

People like saying things for effect. Especially online. 
They want the argument.
They want the reaction.
Because that gives them power.

So don't give it to them.

Sometimes the most powerful move you can make is to look someone dead in the eye and say:

“Okay. Fair enough.”
Then get on with your day. 

You're a smart. 

And smart people don’t waste time trying to win stupid arguments.

And if your customers can't find you - you don't have a business. 

And social media platforms, like LinkedIn are training the bots that are shaping how people find you online.	
SE Ranking did a study recently and found that social media sites show up in over 33% of Google’s AI search results.

Which basically means, if you as an individual - or your business are not visible on social media, you're invisible in search results, too. 

So how do you fix that?
You AI who HELL you are.

And you do that by surprise surprise, owning your niche. 
Post about your expertise - consistently - until your name is synonymous with the topic.

I know, shocking advice. 

But what you might not know is that there are little hacks you can use like;
- Your captions. 
- Your keywords.
- Titling your files (like this video) with ""YOUR NAME - YOUR EXPERTISE"" help Google AI and ChatGPT associate you with your topic.

Because that is what Google is indexing.

So when you Google or search for personal branding, my name comes up. 

I've been using Planable and SE Visible - the new tool from SE Ranking for the last few weeks to optimise my content for AI search.

It helps me;
- Track my brand's presence across AI tools like ChatGPT.
- Work out the topics, trends, and questions AIs associate with my brand (and my competitors... 👀)

And also if you're currently staring and your computer screen for the 18th time this month, thinking ""what the fck am I going to post?"" Planable and the SE Visible dashboard helps you plan content that’s timely, relevant, and discoverable.

Stunning.

I could not be prouder of her.
You know what I was even prouder of?

The fact that she sent me an email asking me to promote it for her. 

Stefanie Sword-Williams - the author of F*ck Being Humble has just released a book called The Career Come Down.

And yesterday she sent me an email saying ""hey Amelia, this book is coming out
and I could really do with your support. Here are some ways that you can support me.""

She then gave me:
- some ideas 
- some questions
- and some copy that I could share on my social media to direct people to her new book.

Women run 18% to 20% of all businesses in the UK, but one of the reasons
we're unable to scale them to the heights that a lot of men can is because we don't f*cking promote them!

We don't ask people to promote our business.
We don't ask people to support us.
We think that we cannot do that because if we do, we will be being ""braggy"".

Take a leaf out of Stef's book and f*ck being humble.

And ask your friends for support. 
If you've got a book coming out.
A business launching.
A new product.
Maybe you've just moved careers.
Or you want build your personal brand. 

Ask your friends to support you.
And even better tell them how you want them to.

Life is too short not to have supportive friends. 
And if people are really your friends. they're not going feel weird about supporting their friend's new venture.

That woman is... me 😂

I run personal brand strategy days all the time.
That part isn’t new.
What was new was how this client found me.

They didn’t go on Google, or ask around colleagues for advice. 
They typed into ChatGPT: “Best personal branding strategist.”

My name came up.

And that didn’t happen by accident.
For the last few years, I’ve prioritised being findable by AI, not just searchable on Google.

And look, Google isn’t dying overnight.
But don’t confuse slow death with no death.

This feels exactly like when web crawlers showed up in the 90s.
Back then, it was obvious the Yellow Pages were in trouble (remember those?!).

It just took ten years for them to feel it.

The difference now is tech is smarter. 
Adoption is faster.
Behaviour changes quicker.
And Gen Alpha won't even know what a “search engine” is.

Nearly 60% of searches now end without a single click.
People aren’t scrolling links - they’re asking AI for answers.

And you need to know where and how AI is showing your brand to those people. 

That’s why tools like SE Visible - the new AI tool from SE Ranking matter - it shows whether your brand appears in AI answers and what’s influencing that visibility.

And then you need to actually do something with that insight.

I've been using Planable and SE Visible - for the last few weeks to optimise my website and my content for AI search.

It helps me;
- Track my brand's presence across AI tools like ChatGPT.
- Work out the topics, trends, and questions AIs associate with my brand (and my competitors... 👀)
- Win business from ChatGPT

Your business isn’t successful because you have a big team - it’s successful if it makes... drum roll... profit.

Profit is the real measure of success. 

And maybe you're reinvesting right now, maybe you'd like to reduce that corp tax bill - so you're posting a bit fat £0. 

That's cool.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-19T07:36:51.796Z,392,152,5,image,"When I first started my personal branding agency, we were a generic marketing agency.

We managed company brands.
Personal brands. 
Social media.
Website builds.
Copywriting.
Blogs.
Training and LinkedIn workshops.

And be we... I mean me.

I did everything. 

The business didn’t specialise in personal branding until about 3/4 months after I began trading. 

And that decision to niche initially LOST me business. 

I’d been working with two recruitment businesses since the month I founded the agency.
Combined they were paying me about £6500 a month in retainers to manage their company brands
Money I couldn't afford to lose.

But I lost them anyway.

Once we'd been going for a few months, I raelised that the #1 enquiry the business got was for personal branding. 

That is what people saw the business - and me as. 

So I made the scary decision to niche. 

I got on calls with our clients and told them I could no longer help as it just wasn’t the right decision for my business. 

One of them took it well.
We had an off boarding period which gave me some grace to fill the revenue hole - and their business some time to find a replacement agency. 

The other, didn’t. 

I still remember the email the CEO sent me. 

The reason I’m telling you this, is I didn’t decide that Klowt was going to be a leading *personal branding agency - that decision was made for me… but only ONCE I’d started the business.

Because the data and my heart couldn’t lie - the best results my agency was getting for clients was through personal brands. 

So, Klowt became a personal branding ONLY agency. 

We lost money in the beginning, sure. 

But what I lost in initial revenue, I’ve won in brand equity, notoriety and humbly… infamy as THE personal branding company. 

You can make plans, you can try and forecast, check milestones off your list before you take the plunge - or you can just go for it, and let the right decisions present themselves as you move forward. 

Just go for it. 

Because even a sailing boat can only open its sails up AFTER it’s left the harbour.

And honestly, no one talks about the real-f*cking-life reality of building a business.

I’m not talking about the polished highlight reel.

I mean the messy, exhausting parts: the school runs, and negotiating your next funding round as the only woman in the room.

I’ve been questioning why there are so few spaces where women who are actually building and scaling can talk about this stuff properly, without pretending or performing.

So I’m hosting Girl Dinner: a small, curated supper club for ambitious women.

A table where you can share unfiltered stories, feel genuinely seen, and back each other wholeheartedly.

This isn’t just another networking event.
(And it’s definitely not warm prosecco in a basement in London 😂)

It’s for women who want real conversations, and a laugh, with people who actually get it.
The late nights. The self-doubt.
The wins that barely cover the bills… and the ones that feel impossible.

There are only 4 seats left!

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-24T07:31:15.478Z,393,121,7,linkedinVideo,"I used to overthink everything. 
Even recording this video. It would be;

The timing. 
The branding. 
The lighting. 
The mic that is hanging off my top because the lapel broke... would have sent me into a panic. 

And then I realised… nobody actually cares. 

The world doesn’t care how you get from A to B. 
It only cares that you got the result.

If you’re building a business right now, I know it’s hard. 
Juggling kids.
Partners.
Friends.
And somehow squeezing in a workout between it all. 

But the longer you wait for “perfect timing,” the longer you’re putting off actually getting results.

Confidence doesn’t come before you start, it comes from doing it. 
And waiting to “feel ready” is the slowest way to fail.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-11-28T07:45:07.825Z,369,141,5,image,"If you're wondering why your LinkedIn reach is down..
... it's because LinkedIn now want you to PAY to boost your posts. 

It's a pretty textbook algorithm cash-grab. 

Build free user base. 
Get users to create content. 
Give content lots of reach. 
More users then create content. 
Then reduce reach. 
Everyone cries. 
Charge them to increase it. 

Meta did it. 
TikTok did it. 
Now LinkedIn is doing it. 

Pretty smart actually. 

But this is why you need to stop listening to people telling you to ""hack the algorithms"" -  and just say stuff you believe in. 

Focus on your customer. 
Give your knowledge away for free. 

And for the love of God, please have dreams bigger than 100k followers. 

If you're a business owner, you should be posting content to find customers. 
Not to find popularity. 

Focus on that, and you'll be 10x more successful than 99% of the ""creators"" you follow on this platform.

If you want to dip your toe into LinkedIn (and make money from it) I recorded a 52 short videos detailing how you can turn your LinkedIn profile into your biggest marketing tool.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-20T08:02:02.119Z,391,116,7,linkedinVideo,"Are you running a business… or a charity?
Because 97% of the content you post gets 0 ROI.

Here’s how you connect your organic social media to your sales funnel really quickly.

One of the best lead gen campaigns we ran for a client was painfully simple:

1: we made a list of all the dream clients they wanted to work with

2: we built a social media plan designed around the company’s expertise — and we got the team to post it

3: we created a content series filmed by senior leadership deep diving how awesome  the brands they wanted to work with where… and tagged those brands and the senior leadership… 

Then we let ego do the rest.

The people tagged commented: “thank you so much for featuring us.”

- This content strategy led to warm introductions.
- Those intros led to inbound opportunities.
- And finally… conversions.

Content ideas isn’t actually the hard part.
Linking them up to your sales funnel is.

If you need more leads for your agency, Planable just dropped the “10 Lead Gen Agency Tactics” playbook that breaks down how to:

- tightening up your positioning
-  use content for leads (not just engagement)
- build a lead magnet (my fave)
- use case studies as social proof
- run smart ads
- build referrals
- start repurposing content to get more business

Honestly, marketing yourself as an agency is one of the biggest problems that ironically most agencies have.

I built a 100% inbound business model for my agency purely off connecting organic content we were posting with our sales workflow.

97% of businesses posting content make zero money from it.

Don’t be one of those businesses!

Hattie has been a part of my closed group coaching program for over a year. 

And since then;
- She's quit her job. 
- Launched her business. 
- Sold out her coaching program. 
- Hosts monthly in person events with her ideal customers meet in real life and get so bought in to her - and her community, they refer more people to join.

And Hattie only appeals to a market size of about 80,000 people, globally. 

That is a TINY market. 
And she owns it all of it. 

Most founders think: “Bigger audience = more money.”

Wrong.

Bigger audience = weaker message.
Weaker message = lower trust.
Lower trust = fewer sales.

You don’t get paid for being “capable.”
You get paid for being the obvious choice.

And the fastest way to become the obvious choice is to pick a niche so specific people say:

“Oh… this was built for me.”

So no - going niche doesn’t shrink your opportunity.

It concentrates it.

If you’re broad, you’re competing on price.
If you’re specific, you’re competing on value.

Because the money isn’t in the size of your audience - It’s in how valuable you are perceived to them.

meet Sharmadean Reid MBE.

Sharmadean started small. When she was at university she and her friends created a magazine that focused on creativity, confidence and womanhood.

That tiny idea evolved into an incredible first business: a nail salon in London.

But the nail salon was so much bigger than just a place to get your nails done.
It very quickly became THE place to go. 

Women coming together to talk about work, relationships, confidence, money. 
It was about everything that made women who they are.

Now she runs:

- The Stack World, a global community for ambitious women
- 39 BC, an ancient-inspired fragrance and oil line
- The New Method, a retreat and mastermind for women looking to redefine wealth and work

On paper, those businesses have absolutely nothing in common.

And yet, if you look at Sharmadean's Instagram feed, she posts about every single thing that she is working on and all the passion she has in between.

The golden thread that locks all of these things together is her. 
And that is why it works.

In a world where everyone is trying to create perfectly curated feeds, Sharmadean has made the strategy HER.

It's chaotic. 
It's lively. 
It's bold. 
It's vibrant.

Go take a look at her feed. She is the brand. 

She doesn't separate her business from her personal life. She blends them. And that is why her strategy is so good.

Your company brand or personal brand doesn't need to be perfect.

What it does need to be is honest and authentic.

Sharmadean's strategy isn't a strategy, and that's exactly why it's so effective.

She shows up. She talks about business, beauty, burnout, wellness, spirituality - and somehow it all works.

So if you're someone trying to build a company brand or post content on your own social media - show up as the chaotic, beautiful, vibrant version of yourself, because that is what people connect with, and that is what will make customers buy from you.

If I wanted my first paid speaking gig in 2026, this is exactly what I’d do ↓

1. I’d host my own event.
Before I’m “ready” and before anyone gives me permission, I’d book a local space, grab a couple of cameras, and deliver a keynote. Make NO money. But make proof. Footage, photos, testimonials, and a talk I can reuse everywhere. If you want to be paid to speak, you need to look like a speaker, first.

2. I’d position myself as a speaker everywhere.
I’d put “Speaker” in every bio and build a dead-simple landing page. No fancy design. Just:

- who I am
- 2–3 talk topics
- who it’s for
- how to book me

It’ll feel cringe. Do it anyway. This is how people find speakers now: search, referrals, skim, book.

3. I’d get ruthless about my topics.
I’d pick three things I’ve lived, built, or learned the hard way. Not “my thoughts on leadership.” Real experiences. Real outcomes. Real lessons.
Because experience beats expertise every time. And paid stages want the intersection of story + strategy.

4. I’d go where the money is.
Corporates - big companies with real budgets. I’d outreach and position myself as practical, relevant, and action-led. Not aspirational or vague. Lead with outcomes - because that is where the big $$$ is. 

You do not need a big conference stage to become a speaker.

but if you don’t look bookable, you won’t get booked.
That’s not unfair. That’s business.

If you're getting started with speaking in 2026, give this a go - and let me know how you get on!

*Save this for later*
This works for personal AND company brands. 

1) Attention content
Job: get seen
Best for: views
Feels like: “oh this is GOOD”

This is your:
- founder stories
- lists + systems
- simple, practical education anyone can understand

Attention content is how strangers find you.
But strangers don’t buy. Yet.

2) Affinity content
Job: get remembered
Best for: followers
Feels like: “she gets it”

This is your:
- deeper stories (wins + losses)
- behind-the-scenes  
- super-niche education for your ideal audience/customer 

Affinity content is what turns “random viewer” into “I like her.”
But, that is still not enough to sell.
Because liking you isn’t the same as trusting you.

3) Action content
Job: get paid
Best for: leads
Feels like: “I want that result”

This is your:
- before/afters
- transformations
- case studies
- clear offers

And if you don’t have results to share yet, borrow proof.

Break down known people, celebrities + brands and say:
“Here’s exactly what I’d do and why.”

Because action content is what turns attention = leads.

Most people post Attention.
A few have the courage to post Affinity.
Almost nobody posts Action.

And that’s why most content gets 0% ROI.

If your content doesn’t move people from Attention → Affinity → Action, you might get some likes. 

But you'll never generate leads. 

If you want this turned into a weekly plan you can actually follow, there are 9 videos as part of my 52-video masterclass that teach you;

how to create content people actually like (levers + post types + rotation)
how to turn that content into leads (inbound funnel + follow-up + outreach)

We admire them.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-14T08:50:31.425Z,325,89,5,linkedinVideo,"I ran a $4 million dollar personal branding agency and there was only ever one reason why clients fired us.

The last five years I've been building and growing the UK's leading personal branding agency, Klowt.

And during that time we have worked with hundreds and hundreds of CEOs
and founders. 

We've helped these people get millions and millions of organic views.

And there was only ever one reason why our clients fired us and it wasn't because our work was bad.
It's because our communication was terrible.

We'd split feedback across:
- Email
- WhatsApp 
- Slack 
- and ""quick calls""

We'd agree things on phone calls verbally and then never follow up in writing. 
And sometimes work would go out that the client had given feedback to amendments hadn't been made and we'd have to delete and apologize.

And of course I then spent all of my time...
- onboarding
- offboarding 
- on feedback calls
- and then replacing the clients we'd lost.

It was exhausting.

So, about 18 months into this merry go round we created a content bible each client's content bible. 

It contained: 
- content plans
- their strategy
- the tone of voice 
- everything that you need to know to create and approve
content at scale.

But then we had a separate scheduling tool.

Which meant that content being copied across from the planner
to the scheduler sometimes got missed.
Mistakes got made.
Last minute edits never got actioned.
Repeat of sh*t show #1. 

So, 2 years ago we switched to Planable. 

Planable is amazing because you can create plan, get feedback
and internally and externally approve content all in one place.

And schedule it, too. 

The best part about it is there's two different views. 
There's an internal view - you can talk to your internal team about the content that's been created in the plan. 
And then there's an external view - where you can share links with your clients
for them to approve add comments or post themselves. 

And they don't even have to log in to do this. 

Planable's put together a free social media communication kit. It has;

- kick off call frameworks
- email templates you can steal 
- an etiquette playbook (I think a lot of people on the internet need one of those)

And a ton of other stuff that stops service based projects turning into bin fires. 

You can grab it free, here: https://lnkd.in/enhyqwzx

Trust me when I tell you service based businesses - especially marketing agencies need to provide an experience to thrive in 2026.

It's not enough to just be amazing at graphic design or social media, you have to provide your client with an experience that makes them want to stay.

And if your communication is rubbish then i t doesn't matter how good the rest of your work is.

Self-doubt will always show up.

It’ll tell you that you’re not ready, not capable, not good enough.
And that’s totally human.

But confidence isn’t waiting for the fear to disappear.

Confidence comes from deciding to just f*cking doing it anyway. 

From moving forward, even when you don't feel ready.
From making decisions based on what actually happens, not what *might* happen.

So whatever fear or self-doubt is holding you back today - feel it, and do it anyway.

You’ll thank yourself later. 💜

Having loads of followers doesn't mean they're successful. 

Profit is sexier than funding. 

Most people with the title ""CEO"" work from their parents spare room.

Everyone on the internet is “successful” until you ask how many invoices got paid.

Motivation is a $8 billion industry. If you tried, you're already more successful that most of the people investing in it. 

Elon launched - and crashed his SpaceX rocket and is still the richest man in the world. 

90% of businesses fail in the first 2 years - even the ones with funding. 

Nobody remembers your “cringe” post that got 2 likes - but they do remember the person who helped them.

You can start again. As many times as it takes. That’s literally the job.

Goal for 2026: 
Just f*cking try. 

If you can manage that, you're already halfway there.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-04T08:00:13.140Z,303,98,4,image,"I built a $4mil revenue agency off the back of posting on Linkedin.
Here are 5 tools that kept our agency pipeline full (without me chasing dead leads 50 million times) ↓

1. Pipedrive 
CRM meets email nurturing system. Capture every inbound lead. Automate personalised follow-ups. Qualify quietly in the background. No manual chasing until they’re ready for a pitch call.

2. Dripify 
Sales automation that plugs into your Linkedin. Views profiles. Likes posts. Connects. Messages. Follows up. You can use Sales Navigator OR just the simple search function. I’d start with 1,000 people. Paste the list URL into Dripify. Build a short sequence. Hit GO. It runs on autopilot and grows your network with targeted people. 10/10, highly recommend.

3. Harmonic 
Uses AI to map the private company landscape for investors + sales teams. Funding alerts are the cheat code. The second a company raised, I’d be the first to DM the CEO: “Well done” (+ do you need help with your branding). Timing beats perfect copy.

4. Gong
Records + transcribes calls. Flags objections, risks, competitor mentions, and what your best sales people do differently. If you want consistent sales quality beyond you as the founder, this is how.

5. Mutiny 
Personalises your website experience for target accounts so warm prospects land on pages that speak to them. Helps massively if you’re trying to convert “interested” leads into booked calls.

Give them a go - let me know how you get on!

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-18T08:00:26.318Z,309,86,8,image,"My agency charged £5,000/month for a service that cost £2,690 to deliver.

That’s £2,310 profit per client.
A 46.2% margin.

At our peak we had 34 retained clients at once.
You do the maths.

Most agencies hover around 12–20% EBIT.

And we used to, too. 

Not because we're all bad at delivery.
Because we were all bleeding time on work that shouldn’t exist.

Reporting.
Screenshotting.
Formatting.
Time spent putting together decks.
“Can you just pull the numbers?” messages on Slack.

My team used to build monthly analytics reports in Canva.

Looked nice.
Cost ~£500 in headcount (inc. tax) per report.

On a £5k retainer, that’s 10% of revenue gone…
in a few hours… on stuff that doesn’t need a human being.

So we changed three things:
1. One tool (one cost) for scheduling + analytics
2. Dashboards we could open live on the call (no prep)
3. Reporting across everything - including our client's personal pages for the full picture. 

We shopped around.

Most tools were either:
scheduling with trash reporting
or
reporting that didn’t work on personal pages
or
another login, another tab, another “process”

Then we spoke to Vlad Căluș, co-founder of a Romanian startup called Planable.

(They got acquired last year - Love to see amazing founders win!)

And it solved the exact problem we actually had:

- One place to schedule.
- One place to report.
- Across all socials - including personal pages (most tools fail here)

The reports are also fully customisable to each client with added context so the report speaks for itself. 

So all the manually-heaving Canva reports died.
We gain + £500 margin per client, per month. 

And now, we pull up the dashboard in the client meeting and focus on what we're actually paid to talk about - strategy.

That one switch saved us so much time. 
And in an agency time = money. 

If you want higher margins in 2026;

Automate the boring bits.
Keep humans for strategy and sales.

That’s how agencies can still win.

In my opinion ;)

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-11-30T07:45:29.803Z,284,103,7,image,"Very few people are actually honest about the reality of building a business.

They’ll tell you about the freedom.
The moments that make it look easy.
The dopamine hit of being ‘a founder.’

But they rarely mention:

The crippling self-doubt.
The nights you couldn’t sleep because payroll’s due.
The Sundays spent firefighting instead of being with your family.
The mental gymnastics it takes just to stay optimistic enough not to quit and get a regular 9‑5.

Building a business will humble the sh*t out of you. And most people don’t want to talk about that part.

I’ve been there.

When I started my first business, the dream was simple: get paid to do something I love.

I hit that goal in days. Then I wanted more - a million-pound company, to prove to myself that I could do it. 

And I did it in under two years.
But chasing growth came at a cost. 

The goalposts kept moving. Faster. Harder. Longer. More. 

And in 2023, I burned out - emotionally, physically, mentally. I had nothing left to give.

Sitting poolside with my kids, I realised I had lost touch with who I am. 

My identity had become just “founder,” and without that mask, I felt empty. I’d spent years achieving without ever appreciating what I’d done.

But here’s the thing: surviving those moments, facing that chaos, and continuing despite the burnout - that’s what turns you into someone who can handle anything.

Every sleepless night, every impossible problem, every self-doubt-fueled Sunday made me stronger, wiser, and capable of handling challenges I never thought I could.

So yes, building a business will humble you. 

But if you survive it, it will teach you resilience, grit, and the ability to handle anything life throws at you.

Agree?

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-16T08:00:49.854Z,292,88,5,image,"20% of UK businesses are founded by women - > 2% get funding. 
If I were a female founder raising investment in 2026, this is exactly what I would do.

1. Register for SEIS and EIS immediately.

These schemes let angel investors reclaim a chunk of their investment through tax relief, and for many angels, it’s the difference between a yes and a no.

2. Use LinkedIn properly.

Most angel investors literally list their investments on their profiles.
Search “investor”. Filter by industry, location, relevance.
Start building relationships before you need the money.
This is not networking.
This is research.

3. Build your pitch deck around outcomes, not your passion.

This is where most founders lose investors.
They talk about how much they love the idea and forget to explain:
– What problem it solves
– Who pays for it
– What the return looks like

Lead with the outcome. Always.

4. DM people who’ve already done it.

Raising investment isn’t some secret club.
If someone’s raised before, you can find it on platforms like Crunchbase.
Message them. Ask for advice. Build rapport.
Then ask for introductions to their angels.
That’s how doors open.

Raising investment isn’t the only way to build a business.
But if you’re a woman building something that does need capital, the system isn’t exactly designed to make it easy.

So make it easier for yourself.

Practical beats perfect.
Relationships beat cold pitches.
And visibility will ALWAYS beat waiting to be “ready”.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-08T07:45:20.176Z,251,121,3,image,"I sat on an investor panel with HelpBnk in September and watched five founders pitch back-to-back.

Different products. 
Different industries. 
Some ideas seemed polished, some didn’t.

But there was one pattern I noticed - the founders who walked away with investment did NOT have the best ideas. Some of the most genuinely smart, high-potential concepts left empty-handed.

The people who got funding knew how to talk to investors.

They didn’t lead with passion.
They didn’t lead with their “why.”
They didn’t lead with how much they cared about solving the problem.

They led with outcomes.

“We made £250k last quarter.”
“The market size is £X billion.”
“Our CAC is £Y and dropping.”
“We converted 40% of users in beta.”

Straight commercial clarity.
Straight to the point. No emotional storytelling. Nothing fancy - just the facts.

Meanwhile, the founders who led with:

“I’m just so passionate about helping people…”
“I really believe in this idea…”
“I love what I do…”

…were sincere.

But they walked away with zero funding.

And this is why sh*tty business ideas get funded all the time. 
And your genuinely good business idea, probably won’t.

Because investment has very little to do with how investable your idea is.
It has EVERYTHING to do with how you position it.

The businesses that get funded…
The candidates who get hired…
The founders investors buy into…

They lead with proof, not passion.
Data, not ideas.
Evidence, not just energy for what they're working on

Investors - and your customers, don’t buy your good vibes.
They buy the evidence you can make them money.

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-01-24T07:45:09.853Z,291,78,5,image,"No one is as unhappy as the people who have never faced adversity. 
Just look at the kids who come from money. 

When I first started my business, I had nothing. 
£1400 in my bank account. 
Mortgage payment due the following weak. 
No mummy and daddy money. 
No plan B. 

I quit my job anyway and went all in - and it was hard. 

When I post about it, I make it sound effortless. ""Quit my job Friday, had 2 clients by the following Thursday"" - true, but not without deep, deep sacrifice, hard work and networking (and posting) my ass off. 

I suffered. 

I suffered through no steady pay check. 
I suffered through winning and losing clients. 
I suffered through learning on the job how to be a manager and a leader (and sucking at both). 

It was rough. 
But I had nothing really to lose - so I went hard. 

And then things go easy. Inbound leads flowed. 
We turned down work we didn't want. 
I bought in new team members. 
Finally got to own my own home, myself.
Bought a new car. 

I stopped doing the things I did before - because I could get the results by doing, nothing.

And then I almost lost it all. 

Clients left.
Team members quit.
I checked out, completely. 
Burned out completely. 

Because we need the struggle to thrive. 

If you’ve done nothing to have everything, it means nothing.  

The older I’ve got, the more sure I am that the meaning of life is failure. 
It’s facing challenges over and over again without a lack of enthusiasm. 

I think we all chase the pot at the end of the rainbow, but it’s the pursuit of the pot that feeds our soul. 

Besides, no one is going to a film to find out the ending - blockbusters are sold on the journey and the BS people have to overcome to win. 

So, if you’re feeling lost, chances are you’re not failing hard enough.

Give it a go - you'll either get a great outcome, or a great story you can share on LinkedIn ;)

It was a clothing brand.

I actually started it at the same time as Conna Walker started House of CB (it was celeb boutique back then, my millennial club rat girlies will remember).

The first 12 months we were flying. 
I had funding, was stocked in 15 different retailers - ASOS wanted to stock us. 

I was even interviewed by FashionTV at London Fashion Week in Sept 2014 - pictured.

Year 2 I lost everything. 

I made some stupid decisions, and within 6 months of feeling on the top of my game, had to liquidate my business and go back and get a job.

It wasn't until 2020 - at the age of 30, I was ready to go again. 
I started Klowt - within 5 years of founding it hit $4mil in revenue, and have worked with some of the most well known entrepreneurs in the Uk on their personal brands. 

To most people that was an overnight success - but the reality is, it took 10 years and a dramatically failed business to get there.

Everyone wants the big moment.
The viral post. 
The sold-out launch. 
The inbox full of opportunities.
But what they don’t see are the years before that moment - the late nights, the failed ideas, the posts no one liked, the months where you thought, “maybe this just isn’t working.”

It’s not that it doesn’t happen for you - it’s that it’s still happening.

Every time you show up, every piece of feedback, every person who finds you -
it’s all compounding, even when you can’t see it yet.

So stop measuring your success in days.
And start looking at how far you've come, since you started. 

Because it doesn’t happen overnight - but it does happen.

And it nearly cost me everything that actually mattered.

I worked 80-hour weeks.
Sacrificed my social life.
Vacations.
Birthdays. Sports days. Weddings.
Time with my kids.

I burned out.

For what?

A multi-million pound valuation…
and a life I hated living.

I still remember the moment I realised that I didn't actually want this. 

I was on holiday with my family. 
My dad playing with my kids in the pool. 
I was on my laptop, fresh off a Zoom call. 

It was my birthday. 

I snapped.

Not because of the hard work. 
Everything is hard work. 
Because I was running on fumes and pretending it was “ambition”.

Success is really easy to chase when you don’t stop to define it.
So you borrow someone else’s definition.

- Bigger revenue
- Bigger team
- Bigger title
- Bigger valuation

But “bigger” isn’t actually strategy.
It’s a trap.

Because the unexpected bill always shows up:

Your health.
Your relationships.
Your peace.
Your enjoyment of the life you're supposedly trying to build.

And one day you wake up with the thing you thought you wanted
…then realise you built a cage.

It took for me to nearly have a nervous breakdown to realise that. 

So I changed how I think about ambition.

I have a team of 4. 
I pick my kids up at ""normal time"" every day. 
I hang out with them on the weekends. 
I say no to sh*t.
I have an awesome business that has given me an awesome life. 

Not the other way around. 

If you're reading this and relate, ask yourself - honestly;

1 Does your business make your life better - or worse? 
2 Is this what you wanted success to feel like?
3 Given the chose, would you choose this again for the next 5 years?

Because you do have a choice. 
It's your life. 

And if your business requires you to disappear from yours to succeed… it’s not really success.

You're going to be dead in a few years. 
And within 30 years of that, no one will even remember your name. 

So, I guess what I'm aksing is - what are you optimising for:
impressing people… or enjoying your life while you've still got one?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ameliasordell_i-spent-5-years-building-a-25m-business-activity-7431601241597784064-evER?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACV_bv4Bk5ERfS1sLjiBOKctm-e1auj5DDg

That’s why I loved filming I Have Never: Business Edition with NatWest Business.  Real founders being honest, supportive and collaborative.

Personal branding isn’t an ego driven activity, it’s a strategic marketing imperative. And if you’re a business in 2026 who’s not leveraging the personal brands within the organisation to accelerate the company’s mission, you’re missing out on attention. 

And in 2026, attention IS the mission.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ameliasordell_personal-brands-receive-561-more-reach-and-activity-7418562837867847680-6tC_?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADtNJIwB7YeBWk5OSR57XvTciKjhzeBfg7M

I sat down with an incredible group of founders to 
play I Have Never: Business Edition with NatWest Business.

Favourite moment:

“I have never thought about quitting.”
Tim: “Every morning while I’m brushing my teeth.”

Hard relate 🤣

Shoutout to;

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2025-12-27T08:00:10.360Z,209,60,4,image,"When I first started my agency, I charged £25 an hour. 
By 2024, we charged £2500 a day.  
And let me tell you, the difference between a £100 client and a £100,000 client is how much aggravation they give you. 

I joke, I joke. 
Kind of 😂

A 100 client doesn’t think you’re valuable.
They think you’re replaceable.

You’re one option on a long list of people who “do the same thing” for the same price. They see you as just another option.

So often, they don't respect your time, your energy - your work. 

But a £100,000 client has a completely different psychology.

They know there’s a very small number of people who can do what they need done, at the level they need it.
And they’ll pay whatever it costs to get the right person.

So, if you’re stuck serving the masses when you want to be serving the premium end of the market, your positioning is wrong.

And that’s exactly why you need to build your personal brand.

When your content clearly communicates that you’re:

- Highly valuable
- Highly strategic
- Highly paid

You stop getting “Can you do it cheaper?”
And you start getting, “When can you start?”

High-ticket clients don’t care about price.
They care about trust, credibility, and perceived value.

If you want to stop losing premium clients to people who simply position themselves better, this is the moment to fix it.

I just launched 52 video lessons on how to do this. Get it now. It will never be this price again: https://lnkd.in/ek7REgzU",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ameliasordell_when-i-first-started-my-agency-i-charged-activity-7410590303063162880-Qjo5?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE5-yf0BZJ5P96bn1SJEYllpQTn7r8Tqvhc

Amelia Sordell 🔥,ameliasordell,2026-02-21T09:30:24.396Z,185,74,5,image,"When you’re ambitious, you dream big.

You’ve got these massive goals and milestones you want to hit, and the leaders of the dreamers inspire everyone to come along for the ride.

But the issue with having big dreams is it can be so hard to see what that map is to get there. 

And that lack of direction is often what makes us feel lost.

I can really relate to that. 
I have HUGE dreams – and sometimes they’re so big that you’ve got no idea where to start.
And so don’t. 

You sit in that lack of direction, and then lose all sense of it.

But if you’re a dreamer you don’t have to achieve your dreams today. 

You just have to do one thing that moves the needle towards it.

You want to start a business? 
Go and research your competition.
You want to start building a personal brand? 
Go and optimise your social profile.
You want to find the love of your life? 
Register for a dating app.

No great things were achieved by dreamers who just dreamed. 
You have to take action. 

But if you’re unsure what that action should be, just do one tiny thing that moves towards it.

Because tiny things compound into climbing huge mountains x

As I look at the trajectory of ServiceNow’s growth, and how far we’ve come, this is both a natural and truly exciting next step. We have always been grounded in simply making it easier to get work done. This is a great example of how we’ll continue to do this in the AI era.

It was the wake-up call I needed: ignoring my health wasn’t an option. It forced me to learn that high performance starts with protecting your own capacity.

As the President and CFO of a Fortune 500 company—as well as a wife, mom, and board member on two boards—underperforming isn’t an option. This means that fitness is non-negotiable, even when it’s challenging to make it happen.

I recently shared more about this in an article for Entrepreneur Media (linked below), but here are a few of the biggest ways fitness has shaped my leadership:

🏃‍♀️  Greater stamina, lower stress

Between constant travel and long days, stamina is everything. When I’m consistent with exercise, I stay sharper through 12–14 hour days and fall asleep more easily at night. 

💪  A stronger body builds a stronger presence

Confidence matters. Strength training has helped me take up both physical and professional space. The discipline I build in the gym shows up in the boardroom and on the stage.

👥  Your habits shape the culture

When employees see leaders prioritizing their health and wellness, it gives them permission to do the same. That’s something we’re very intentional about at ServiceNow.

One example is our annual WellFest: a full week dedicated to movement, recovery, and holistic wellbeing for all 28,000+ of our employees. It’s a reminder that high performance isn’t just about output—it’s about taking care of the people who make the work possible.

For leaders, the real edge isn’t stamina for one quarter. It’s the capacity to sustain high performance year after year.

What’s one habit that helps you perform at your best, personally or professionally?

Back then, success ","If you asked me 20 years ago what success looked like, I probably would have given you a very different answer than I would today. Back then, success felt like more—more responsibility, more career growth, more time at work. Today, as a leader, a wife, and a mom to two incredible boys, I’ve realized success isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters most.

Balancing a high-intensity career with family life isn’t always graceful (any working parent knows that!), but I’ve learned that real success isn’t just about professional milestones—it’s about being present. It’s about making time for the people who matter, prioritizing my own well-being so I can show up as my best self, and recognizing that leadership—whether at home or in the workplace—is about leading with intention.

This means setting boundaries, giving myself permission to pause, and embracing the reality that work-life balance isn’t a perfect equation—it’s an ongoing recalibration. Some days, my role as a leader takes center stage. Other days, it’s being fully there for my family. Both matter. Both are success.

To all the working parents out there navigating this journey, I see you. Let’s redefine success—not as a never-ending race, but as a life filled with purpose, connection, and impact.

How do you define success in this chapter of your life?

Years ago, I was preparing to make a major life move. I had resigned from my job (even turning down a promotion), packed up my apartment, and was ready to relocate across the country for a relationship. 

A week before I was supposed to move, my then-boyfriend showed up at my empty apartment and ended things.

In that moment, I had two choices:
1) Call my boss and ask for my job back.
2) Step back, reevaluate everything, and choose a different path forward. 

I'd worked since I was 12 years old, and I was about to turn 30. So, I decided to take a little time off. I bought a one-way ticket, traveled for six months, and finally gave myself the space to figure out what I actually wanted—from my career and from my life.

When I came back, I was more focused and determined than ever. I took a big role at IAC, which ultimately put me on the path to becoming Revlon’s international CFO five years later.

That moment changed everything for me. In addition to making me rethink what I wanted from my career, it also forced me to reflect on what I needed in a partner—someone who would support my ambitions. 

That's exactly what I found. My husband is my biggest cheerleader, the best decision I've ever made, and I wouldn't be here without his unwavering support.

Pivotal moments rarely feel inspirational while you're living them. More often, they feel like everything is falling apart but sometimes they’re clearing the path for what comes next.

I liv,"One of the questions I'm most often asked is how I find time to work out with my busy schedule. The truth is—I don't find the time. I make it. 

I live by one simple rule: ""Put your own oxygen mask on first."" To perform at your best—for your team, your family, and yourself—you have to take care of YOU first. I'm 100% convinced I couldn't operate at the level I do without investing in my health.

Here’s what my fitness routine looks like:

💪 Strength training: 3x per week, full-body sessions with weights. Strength training keeps me grounded. It builds not just muscle, but resilience and confidence.

🏃‍♀️ Cardio: About 60–90 minutes per week. One high-intensity interval session for heart health and VO₂ max. Two “zone 2” steady-state sessions to build endurance and stamina.

🧘 Mobility & flexibility: 1 dedicated hour a week. It looks easy but it's the hardest thing I do. I find that the small, controlled movements have the biggest impact. 

☀️ Morning movement: At least 3 mornings a week, that's 15 minutes of yoga or stretching to get my body moving and my mind focused.

🛏️ Sleep: 8 hours a night. It's the foundation for everything—energy, focus, and performance.

Health and fitness aren't just part of my routine; they're part of my leadership philosophy. I love when people on my team text or email me about hitting their fitness goals—it's proof that discipline inspires discipline.

What's one non-negotiable in your health and fitness routine that keeps you performing at your best?

People often ask me: ""Did you always know you wanted to be a CFO?"" My answer is always the same: never!

Growing up, I didn't see CFOs who looked like me. The idea that this could be my path didn’t even cross my mind. I chose accounting because I wanted job security—not because I imagined myself becoming a CFO.

As my career evolved and I realized that opportunity could arise, I pushed hard to broaden my skill set, take risks, and get comfortable being uncomfortable.

That’s why a recognition like this is so meaningful. It's a reminder of how far you can go even without a blueprint—and how important it is to be visible for the next generation. You can’t be what you can’t see.

A special shoutout to my ServiceNow team as well: Inc. also recognized ServiceNow as Best in AI Implementation, reinforcing what we live every day—disciplined execution, the strength of our platform, and the incredible traction we’re seeing in AI.

Throughout my career, I’ve learned exercise is essential for my wellbeing. It keeps me grounded both physically and mentally. It allows me to show up every day as my best self – a mom, wife, friend, colleague, and CFO.  
 
Today, World Mental Health Day, is a powerful reminder that our mental health deserves just as much attention as our physical health. Taking time to recharge, checking in with yourself, or having an honest conversation with someone you trust can go a long way in maintaining that work-life harmony (balance is overrated!).  

So today, no matter where you are, I encourage you to take a moment for YOU. Get outside, go for a walk, meditate, do something that clears your head.  

I’m grateful ServiceNow prioritizes its wellbeing, offering incredible emotional, physical, financial, and social resources and benefits. When everyone feels safe and supported, we can all do our best work, live our best lives, and fulfill our purpose to make the world work better together.

The energy, passion, and camaraderie were unmatched—I’m still riding the wave of inspiration.

This year’s theme, Right Here, Right Now, perfectly captured our collective mission: to focus, execute, and seize the opportunities in front of us. I had the privilege of partnering on stage with Jacqui Canney, Chris Bedi, Paul Fipps, Michael Park, Josh Kahn, and Steve Lucas, where we spoke about the exponential possibilities of embracing agentic AI. But this week was really about celebrating our people, our purpose, and the relationships that fuel our success.

One of my favorite moments was sharing Now on Now stories and participating in the fun (and highly competitive!) Who Wants to Be an AI Innovator? game show. It was a blast showcasing how we’re embedding AI into everything we do to drive meaningful, real-world outcomes for our customers. 

And speaking of meaningful outcomes, it was truly special to join my ServiceNow colleagues in giving back through a charitable activity for the Make-A-Wish America Foundation. Together, we stuffed hundreds of teddy bears for kids in need—an experience that warmed my heart and reminded me of the incredible impact we can make beyond the workplace.

I’m leaving this kickoff more inspired and motivated than ever, knowing we’re poised to help our customers crush their business objectives. Let’s make Right Here, Right Now our best moment yet!

Elite-level sales execution doesn’t happen by accident. It takes grit. Real grit. The kind that shows up when things get hard, when the deal gets complicated, and when the quarter gets tight. It takes discipline—turning process into muscle memory, and consistency into a competitive edge. Above all, it takes belief. Belief in our vision, in our customers, and in each other.

To our hard-working global field team—THANK YOU! You've set the standard, shattered expectations, and shown the world what first-rate execution looks like.

Celebrate this moment—you’ve earned it.

But don’t stop here.

If this is what we can do now, just imagine what’s next. The runway ahead is full of opportunity—and we've got the team to seize it. Let’s keep the pressure on, keep raising the bar, and keep winning TOGETHER.

This quarter wasn’t just strong. It was proof that we’re built for this moment. In one of the most competitive eras in tech, we’re leading with conviction and delivering the AI platform that redefines how businesses transform in the AI era.

Our Q3 results speak for themselves:

✅ 20.5%* year-over-year constant currency cRPO growth, beating the top end of our guidance by 250 bps. 👏
✅ 20.5%* year-over-year constant currency subscription revenues growth, beating the top end of our guidance by 100 bps.
✅ 103 deals over $1 million in net new ACV, including 3 over $20 million.
✅ Now Assist momentum keeps accelerating and exceeding expectations. Our AI products are on pace to exceed half a billion in ACV this year.

These results give us the confidence to raise guidance, once again, across our key financial metrics.

Every win reflects the pace, precision, and relentless spirit of a team that refuses to settle. We’re doing something different. Something no one else is really doing. We’re delivering AI that drives outcomes for our customers TODAY, not someday.

We also celebrated—there’s so much to be proud of from Q2:

🙌 We beat guidance on subscription revenue and cRPO growth, showing investors and analysts, once again, that we are a relentless competitor.
🙌 We have more customers than ever, and they’re signing bigger and bigger deals. Our platform is powerful and sticky, and we have a 98% renewal rate.
🙌  Customers are loving our AI—Now Assist closed its biggest deal to date at over $20M, and we continue to see real AI-enabled efficiencies contributing to our own profitability.

The buzz and pace of New York City was the perfect backdrop for this moment, in the AI era. I shared with the team a quote from the great actress Helen Hayes: “If you rest, you rust.” We will not rust. We’re moving fast. Staying focused. UNITED in our will to WIN. 💪

This investment reflects our disciplined approach to long-term value creation. We set high standards for where we invest, and this deal is expected to triple ServiceNow’s market opportunity for security and risk solutions while accelerating our roadmap to autonomous cybersecurity. 

As AI adoption accelerates, organizations are expanding the number of connected assets and automated actions across the enterprise. Security leaders need a clearer, real-time view of what’s connected, what’s exposed, and what to prioritize first—and they need to act fast to proactively mitigate risk 24/7, not just after an incident.

Armis' deep expertise in cyber exposure management and cyber-physical security combined with ServiceNow’s AI-powered security workflows will help organizations go from visibility to action—with intelligent prioritization and automated remediation that improves risk posture. Together, we’ll build a unified, end-to-end security exposure and operations stack that can see, decide, and act across the entire technology footprint. 

This is another step forward to deliver an AI-native platform that helps customers protect what matters most—their people, operations, and reputations—and enables them to move faster with confidence.

Anyone who works with me at ServiceNow knows I'm big on health and fitness—you can't sustain high performance while running on fumes. 

Beyond the physical benefits, it’s had a profound mental impact on how I show up, especially as a woman in leadership.

Women have long been taught to shrink themselves. That often shows up as subtle pressure to be agreeable before being bold, to soften their point of view, or to avoid “coming on too strong.”

I felt that pressure earlier in my career. Strength training has been a powerful counterbalance to that for me.

What started as something I incorporated into my fitness routine for the health benefits—research on strength training for women, especially women in their 40s and 50s, is hard to ignore—has become something much more.

I love lifting weights. It’s done a lot for my confidence and my presence, especially as I spend more time on stage and in rooms where presence really matters.

There’s something deeply grounding about building physical strength and carrying that same energy into the boardroom. 

The confidence I bring into work starts in the gym—and that confidence shapes how I lead.

This is a strategic investment in one of the country’s fastest-growing business communities.

Alongside universities, public agencies, and private enterprises, we’re working to close the talent gap, expand access to opportunity, and equip organizations to lead in the age of AI. The momentum is real! Our first RiseUp with ServiceNow cohort is underway, providing the workforce with in-demand digital skills and opening new career pathways.

This past weekend, I hit pause and spent time with a few of my gal pals. Laughter, wellness, gratitude, and zero work agendas—exactly what we needed. It’s not just feel-good fluff, the science backs it up—strong social connections improve mental health, reduce stress, and help us show up stronger everywhere.

My colleague and friend Jacqui Canney recently posted about how important it is that we show up for each other. The world isn’t slowing down and as Jacqui says, “we're experiencing massive transformation as AI reshapes how we live and work,” making it even more important to stay grounded, connected, and, on occasion, to unplug in order to recharge.

Consider this my PSA to you: your calendar doesn’t need to be full of meetings to be valuable. Sometimes the most important ROI comes from investing in yourself and the people closest to you—the ones who fill your cup, not just your inbox.

Let’s keep supporting each other, prioritizing wellness, and building the kind of community that lifts us all. Be kind to your mind—and don’t forget to laugh loudly, rest well, and check in with your people. 💓

I had an incredible experien","The modern CFO is no longer just a financial steward—we’re enterprise leaders shaping strategy, innovation, and growth. 

I had an incredible experience at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Conference, where I joined the ""Meet the Modern CFO"" panel hosted by Sheryl Estrada, and also got to hear from leaders like Jamie Dimon.

Here are a few key takeaways I shared:

1. The CFO's seat is at the strategy table. 

Finance is inseparable from strategy. The modern CFO doesn't just report results—we look around corners, anticipate what’s next, and create the conditions for growth.

My current role as both CFO and President reflects that, bringing Finance and Strategy together under one roof. 

2. AI is augmenting work and accelerating growth. 

AI is becoming a key partner at work—and I'm proud that at ServiceNow, we're walking the talk. AI is embedded in how we work. Our incredible Chief People and AI Enablement Officer, Jacqui Canney, spoke about this in her roundtable discussion on The New Leadership Playbook.

One example: our sellers have cut meeting prep by 50%, giving them more time to spend with customers. We've proven the ROI of AI internally—$355M in annualized value created through productivity gains, much of which we've reinvested back into the business leading to $100M in projected cost savings this year. That's durable impact, not hype. 

3. Curiosity is the ultimate leadership edge. 

As the first in my family to go to college, and often the only woman in the room, I learned early the power of curiosity and courage. Every time I’ve gotten too comfortable, I’ve taken a leap. That mindset has kept me learning, growing, and leading with curiosity. 

I strongly believe that the next generation of leaders will not be defined by the depth of their knowledge, but by the breadth of what they can learn and how they inspire others to grow with them.

Thank you, Fortune, Sheryl Estrada, and my fellow panelists, Yanela Frias and Ellie Mertz, for the opportunity to be part of this powerful conversation with such an extraordinary group of leaders! #FortuneMPW",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_fortunempw-activity-7384300692204785664-GylW?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2B0LQBaIdhq7aEqP3FkN299X9A2ZAcLmE

He told me: “Hire the people who can do your job in two to three years—so you can keep growing.”

I've carried that with me ever since. 

Too often, leaders hesitate to hire exceptional talent because they’re worried someone might take their job. The truth is: you SHOULD hire the talent who could take your job.

That's how you build powerhouse teams. It's also how you create the space to keep growing, learning and taking on more yourself. 

Every step in my career has been possible because I built teams strong enough to thrive without me. Teams that were ready to step up the moment I stepped into a new challenge.

At the end of the day, leadership is about elevating others, expanding what’s possible, and creating a culture where excellence attracts excellence. 

When your team rises, YOU rise.

As 2024 comes to a close, I am heading into the holidays both humbled and proud. This was another BIG year for ServiceNow – we achieved new stock and market cap highs; our first mover advantage in GenAI established Now Assist as the fastest-selling new product in our history; we were recognized as a Fortune 500 company for the second year running; and we celebrated our ServiceNow's 20-year anniversary all year long!   

All of this demonstrates the strong demand for THE AI platform for business transformation, the value we continue to drive for customers year after year, and the elite-level execution from our world-class team!  

While I can’t help but to reflect on some of these highlights... I am PUMPED for 2025.

Over the past few weeks, I've been traveling with my son on a college tour from Dallas to Miami and more. 

It's been equal parts exciting, emotional, and surreal to watch him begin this next chapter. Walking these campuses, I can't help but think back to my own college journey and how far our family has come.

I was the first in my family to go to college and I took that responsibility seriously. I started working at the age of 12, first as a babysitter, and then as a hostess and server to put myself through college.

Picking what to study was an entirely pragmatic decision. I wanted stability and to make sure I could take care of myself without ever having to rely on anyone else.

So, I studied accounting at the State University of New York at Albany. State University was my only option, and I chose Albany because it had an incredible business school. I knew people always needed accountants, even in a recession. That decision changed the course of my life.

Watching my son now explore his options touches me deeply. It reminds me that every generation stands on the shoulders of the one before. My parents worked tirelessly so that I could open new doors, and now, I get to watch my son walk through doors that didn't exist for me. 

As a mom, I see my son’s future. As a leader, I see the bigger picture: this generation will step into a world that’s evolving faster than ever. The choices they make—about curiosity, courage, and connection—will shape not just their lives but the way we all work and live.

For those of you who’ve gone through the college visit process—what tips or tricks made the experience more rewarding and meaningful for you? 

For the alumni out there, I’d love to hear your stories. What moments, professors, or traditions shaped your journey?

I’m grateful for any wisdom you’re willing to share. We’re soaking it all in. 💙",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_life-has-a-beautiful-way-of-coming-full-circle-activity-7387123456125046784-eQTZ?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2B0LQBaIdhq7aEqP3FkN299X9A2ZAcLmE

ServiceNow is on the Fortune 500 list for the third year in a row. 

This isn’t just a ranking—it’s a reflection of the incredible work our teams do every day, the trust our customers place in us, and the bold vision we’re making real.

AI is transforming the way we work across every industry. Customers aren’t experimenting—they’re executing. They’re looking for clarity, leadership, and tangible outcomes. They want speed, productivity, and effectiveness—and they need to operationalize AI at scale to capture value safely, securely, and responsibly.

We’re purpose-built to put AI to work for people.

Only ServiceNow unites AI agents, data, and workflows on a single enterprise-grade platform designed for scale, transparency, and efficiency. Others are stitching together pieces to try and unlock agentic AI value. We’re already playing in a different league.

More than 85% of the Fortune 500 are in our court—trusting us to deliver enterprise solutions with AI at the core. We’re not here to follow trends, we’re here to set them, and we’re keeping our customers’ and partners’ success as the ultimate measure of ours.

To every ServiceNow employee, customer, and partner on this journey with us—THANK YOU. The best is yet to come. 🔥

ServiceNow just announced our intent to acquire Veza, a leader in identity security. Together, we can help organizations better understand and control who and WHAT has access to their critical systems and data, and put end-to-end identity governance workflows in place to radically reduce enterprise risk.

I’m making this sound simple, but it’s incredibly complex. Veza’s AI-native approach to relationship mapping and analysis provides unprecedented visibility and control of the identities in an environment. I truly can’t wait to see the impact this will have for our customers when combined with the power of the ServiceNow AI Control Tower.

To Tarun Thakur and the team at Veza—incredible work! We’re thrilled for our future together.

As part of this, we're celebrating WellFest this week—an internal week of wellbeing focused on movement, mindfulness, and connection. It’s one of my favorite moments of the year because it’s a reminder that thriving at work starts with taking care of ourselves.

Over time, I’ve learned that wellbeing isn’t a single action, but a rhythm you build. It takes consistency, intention, and a willingness to prioritize yourself—even on the busiest days. Ultimately, you must put your own oxygen mask on before helping someone else with theirs. 

Here are a few wellness practices that have made a difference for me:

- Move every day. I aim for some form of daily exercise or movement. I also get my steps in (at least 10,000) even if it means walking between meetings or during calls, or getting on the treadmill at the end of a long day.  

- Keep it simple. The power of a routine lies in its repeatability—it eliminates unnecessary decision-making around simple tasks. For example, I eat the same lunch most days.

- Make time for recovery. I used to think performance came from pushing harder. I’ve learned it comes just as much from sleep, rest, and letting your body and mind recharge. 

- Stay connected. Community is a powerful anchor. For me, family, friends, and colleagues remind me what really matters. I carve out time for them and I stick to my commitments. 

- Lead by example. True wellbeing doesn't stop with the individual, it thrives when it becomes part of a company's culture. In my experience, when leaders prioritize it openly, others feel permission to do the same.

One of my most meaningful moments recently was when a colleague texted me to say my focus on wellness inspired them to start their own fitness journey. They felt healthier and more energized as a result. That impact goes far beyond the gym—it’s about building a culture at ServiceNow where we support each other to be at our best.

I know I say this every year, but this was a BIG year for ServiceNow. 

Year after year, I’m struck by how much can happen when talented, passionate people rally around a shared purpose. The numbers tell one story—but the people behind them tell an even better one.

This year, we exceeded every topline growth and profitability metric, with standout performance across the board. We were named to the Fortune 500 for the third year in a row and joined the S&P 100. We were also named a TIME World's Best Company for Sustainable Growth, a Fortune Best Workplace for Parents, and one of Fast Company's Brands That Matter.

We opened our new regional hub and AI Institute in West Palm Beach, deepened partnerships with leading AI innovators like NVIDIA, and saw Now Assist close its largest deal to date—over $20M.

Outside the day-to-day, I’m grateful for the moments that let me connect with my leadership community—from gatherings like the Finance 50 Summit and Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit to lunches with friends and colleagues. Those conversations always leave me energized and grateful.

On a personal note, this year gave me some #proudmom moments—like my younger son’s eighth-grade graduation and taking my older son on his first college tour. I also deeply cherished the time I spent with family, including our trip to London over Thanksgiving after losing my mother-in-law. It was a difficult season, but it also reinforced just how precious (and fleeting) this time really is.

Moments like these are powerful reminders of how quickly time moves—and why the work we do to shape the future matters more than ever.

For us, AI fluency is now table stakes. Every role in Finance & Strategy must confidently leverage agentic tools—from research platforms and summarization engines to forecasting copilots and modeling assistants—to accelerate insight and execution. 

But fluency alone is not sufficient.
 
The real shift is toward hybrid talent: professionals who combine deep financial and strategic judgment with the ability to work with, interrogate, and govern AI at scale. 

These are the architects of modern finance automation and decision-making. Within our teams, this includes emerging roles such as:
 
* The AI Finance Strategist, who understands the business strategies and identifies key opportunities in finance for execution through AI.

* The Finance Ops Specialist, who builds and implements AI workflows that power forecasting, scenario planning, and decision support.

* The AI Risk Specialist, who safeguards integrity by monitoring and mitigating risks tied to AI-driven decisions.
 
Roles like these—and many we haven’t yet imagined—will help us not only continue to adopt AI, but also shape the future of Finance & Strategy.

SKO is one of my favorite moments of the year because it really does bring strategy and execution TOGETHER to serve our incredible customers. 

From Bill McDermott’s fantastic closing keynote to great conversations with our teams, customers, and partners—and a Weezer concert to celebrate—the event was packed with energy.

I was especially excited to share the stage with Shakira Talbot during our EMEA Geo session to talk about ServiceNow CRM and the opportunity ahead.

What we discussed is something I'm hearing consistently from customers, investors, and analysts alike: the entire CRM category is shifting.

It used to be about tracking customer data. Today, it’s about taking action on that data in real time.

We are uniquely positioned to win by bringing sales, service, and fulfillment together on a single AI platform—giving our sellers a more powerful way to lead strategic, end-to-end customer conversations. 

CRM is now a boardroom topic, and we’re investing because we believe deeply in the opportunity ahead.

What gives me the most confidence is this TEAM. SKO was a powerful reminder of what’s possible when the right people are aligned around a shared purpose and a clear vision. The ambition, focus, and readiness to execute were on full display!

It's a subtle mindset shift, but it completely changes how you make decisions. 

So many career moves are driven by frustration—""I don't like my boss,"" ""I don't like the work."" The grass always looks greener somewhere else.

That mindset causes people to run AWAY from what's uncomfortable instead of being clear about what they're actually running toward. 

The better filter is internal, not external. Asking yourself questions like: What am I learning here? What skills am I building? Where am I stretching in ways that will matter five or ten years from now?

Early in my career, I watched a lot of peers leave roles because the next job paid a little more or sounded better on paper. In that moment, it felt like progress but over time, many of those moves capped growth instead of accelerating it. 

To be clear, I'm not talking about cases where there are serious issues—those are exceptions. Outside of that, the best career moves are intentional ones: running TOWARD opportunities that help you learn, grow, and build capabilities that matter long term.

What’s been the hardest but most valuable career move you’ve made?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_one-of-the-most-important-lessons-ive-learned-activity-7424462902960541697-bElz?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC-QBDUB6YMSYpP1cAeIUEedbDaoGqOYyWg

In this moment, I can’t help but to reflect on my career. When I went to college, I embodied a sense of pride – being the first in my family to pursue a higher education. When I landed my first job, I was hungry for the next promotion. Every milestone, every zig and zag, and even every setback fueled my desire to reach higher, learn from those around me, and surround myself with the best hype squad.  
 
I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with and learn from some incredible leaders over the course of my career. Bill McDermott is no exception!

Absolutely electric. 

We had a surprise visit from Gavin DeGraw, who was incredible. Despite a slight audio issue, he didn't miss a beat—he went a cappella, got the whole room clapping and singing along, and turned it into an unforgettable moment. 

ServiceNow’s founder, Fred Luddy, was also in the house. More than 20 years after founding this company, he’s still such an inspiring force of passion and purpose who reminds us every day what we're here to do.

It was an amazing feeling to connect with team members around the world who gathered to celebrate our progress and prepare for what's next. One thing is crystal clear: our growth trajectory has never been stronger.

You can FEEL the momentum in every conversation, every connection, every moment on that stage. Q3 was an exceptional quarter:

🚀 We exceeded EVERY topline growth and profitability metric—with standout performances across the board.

🚀 Our AI story continues to lead the market with our AI products on pace to exceed half a billion in ACV this year. Now Assist once again surpassed expectations—this isn't just revenue, it's validation.

🚀 Our purpose-driven and unified culture was recognized with placements on Forbes America's Best Employers for Company Culture and Fortune Best Workplaces in Technology. 

I said this on stage, borrowing a quote from Nick's favorite anchorman, Ron Burgundy: ""I don't know how to put this, but we're kind of a big deal."" Because that's exactly how I feel about our team. 

As we head into Q4 and set our sights on 2026, I've never felt more grateful for our people and for the work we get to do every day to shape the AI-powered enterprise of the future. 

Let's keep building for the future—together!

As we watch the unprecedented pace of change unfold with AI, I’ve been thinking a lot about what “change” means as a leader.  

In my early career, I thought I had to fit a mold to be taken seriously as a finance professional. I wore my hair pulled back tight and over-indexed on traits like drive, decisiveness, and control.  I turned the volume down on the qualities that felt too “soft.” I presented as the type of professional I thought was the only type that could make me successful. 

Over time, I stopped muting myself. I found that the more I brought my real self to the job—my empathy and passion—the more trusted and more successful I became as a leader.  

Given the current macro conditions and infusion of AI into the workplace, the pressure is on leaders to change and grow faster, to become even more transparent, and to have even more empathy. We must be adept at articulating the value of AI and the reality that—yes, some jobs will change and, in some industries, might even go away. As with every major historical tech breakthrough, innovation can disrupt but it also brings new opportunities. It's our responsibility as leaders to help our teams along by fostering curiosity and experimentation.  

“Change” creates leaders and invites courage. It’s a time to put curiosity over fear. To embrace transformation—including our own, as leaders, as workers, and as people.

Without that example, I didn’t know it was possible. That’s why I’m passionate about sharing my story—and was thrilled to join Ruth Umoh as the first guest in Fortune’s Next to Lead video series.

My own path hasn’t been a straight climb. As the first in my family to graduate from college, I chose accounting because, at the time, it was considered “recession-proof.” That practical choice gave me independence and set the foundation for a career built on learning, curiosity, and risk-taking. Each role and each industry I worked in—from media to beauty to tech—stretched me in new ways and prepared me for my dream role at ServiceNow.

When I first spoke with Bill McDermott about ServiceNow, I knew it was a different kind of company. The opportunity was enormous, the energy was contagious, and the culture matched it—humble, hungry, and customer-centric. It’s a place where leadership puts people first: spotting potential, building strong teams, and cultivating a space for learning and development.

Anyone who knows me knows how much I love Ginni Rometty’s quote, ""Growth and comfort do not coexist.” This idea has not only been the throughline of my career but also the mindset that drives me forward every day at ServiceNow. Growth comes when we stretch ourselves, take risks, and help those around us to succeed.

That’s the message from Juliet Starrett and Kelly Starrett. I’ve been following the duo for years, ever since I learned mobility is essential for my wellbeing. Recently, I had the opportunity to share my fandom with all of ServiceNow – welcoming Juliet and Dr. Kelly to our quarterly Brain Break.   
 
These moments are incredibly valuable. For 30 minutes, all employees had the opportunity to step away from work, tune in, and focus on self-care. It’s part of our People Pact, to live our best lives and do our best work. It starts with taking care of ourselves. 
 
Dr. Kelly and Juliet shared their philosophy on movement and mobility: it doesn't have to be additive to your already busy schedule; it’s about changing habits, making it easier to be consistent. It’s a similar philosophy to adopting new technologies 😊  
 
I leverage Juliet and Kelly’s teachings regularly, but every now and again, we could all do with a subtle reminder to take a 10–15-minute walk after a meal or sit on the ground for 20-30 minutes at night (your hips will thank you!). If you’re really fired up, I challenge you to the sit-and-rise test.

At this year’s ServiceNow US Open Executive Experience, I had the privilege of co-hosting alongside Jacqui Canney and welcoming a powerhouse group of leaders from every corner of the enterprise.

We kicked things off with Ergo geopolitical strategist R.P. Eddy, who underscored that AI acceleration, shifting macro forces, and global policy aren’t slowing down for anyone. His takeaway was blunt and brilliant: resilience isn’t optional—it’s the job description.

That message flowed perfectly into a conversation with Billie Jean King. A legend who didn’t just break barriers but redefined what’s possible, on and off the court. Her playbook—courage, equality, reinvention—still defines what it takes to win. She reminded us that in leadership, just like in tennis, momentum is everything.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned from coming back to the US Open, it’s this: you can’t slow the pace. You can only raise your game. 🎾

I'm all for risk-taking and going after your goals, but I think it's also important to be humble and honest. Sometimes, it's about asking yourself: Where are the gaps in my skillset? What do I need to do to close them? 

Sometimes the best career move is taking the time to grow into the role you want, so you’re truly ready when the opportunity comes.

When I joined Ingram Micro, for example, the role was positioned as a CFO succession plan where I started as their EVP of Finance. Three years later, I was promoted to CFO.

At the time, of course, I was eager to move faster. In hindsight, that time was a gift. The opportunity to learn before leading was a game-changer because the scale and risk profile at Ingram was unlike anything I had managed before.

It gave me the skills and perspective not only to succeed as CFO at Ingram, but also to be fully prepared when the opportunity at ServiceNow came along.

The lesson I share often: Fill your toolbox before you grab the title. The right skills at the right time are what make the ""top job"" sustainable (and successful).

He was so proud of his service to this country. As a Veteran, he made sure we appreciated the freedom we were born into in the United States. He knew life was precious and it was important for him to express his feelings to his loved ones. He pushed us to be better and his expectations for us kids were always high... There were no cutting corners in our house! My dad constantly reminded us that putting in the hard work would pay off. He was right. 

Those values resonate even more today as a mom of two boys. They’re values I live by and see in many of our ServiceNow employees who also served.

While I reflect on my dad and his legacy on Veterans Day, I am filled with immense gratitude to those that have served in the military.

To all Veterans everywhere: Thank you. Thank you for your sacrifice and service. We honor you and celebrate you. Always.

Not all leadership conferences are created equal. I've been to plenty over the years, and if I'm honest, many start to feel the same. Unless, of course, you're at a ServiceNow Global Leaders Summit. Am I biased? Maybe. But I don't think so, here's why.

Thanks to one of our guest speakers, Daniel Newman, we dug into what's really on the minds of business leaders today. A few takeaways that stuck with me:

✅ Companies are willing to disrupt themselves to stay ahead
✅ Disruption cycles are getting shorter
✅ Even the ""right"" strategy won't stay right for long
✅ Passion is contagious… it's the spark that ignites a team

These takeaways underscore what we're all about. At ServiceNow, reinvention isn't a reaction. It's an expectation. We constantly ask: How can we be better than yesterday? How can we help customers achieve their boldest goals? How can we serve each other while flying this rocket ship — one we're proud of, but humble enough to know we don't have all the answers (yet)?

Oh, and of course…we had some fun. We love our emojis. So naturally, one breakout session challenged us to pick three emojis that describe our leadership style. Here are mine:

🔥 Fire — for the passion that fuels me every day
🕵️‍♀️ Detective — for being a steward of strategy and financials
💪 Muscle — for the gym rat in me that keeps me grounded in my wellbeing

Let's have some fun. I'd love to see your three emojis that best represent you, and why?

My dad was a true force—my voice of reason, my fiercest supporter, and a steady presence who instilled in me an incredible work ethic. He left us far too soon, and the ache of missing him never goes away—for me, or for our family.

I carry my dad with me always—and today, especially. I’m deeply grateful to have a strong partner in this parenting journey with my husband Luke, whose love and strength is unwavering. I see so much of what I cherished with my dad reflected in the way he shows up every day for our two boys.

This day can stir up complicated emotions—grief, distance, longing, or memories that don’t match the greeting card version of fatherhood. Studies have shown that commemorative days can be especially heavy for those who’ve lost, who are healing, or who wish things had been different.

As President and CFO of ServiceNow, I’m accountable for both financial discipline and strategic growth. AI presents extraordinary opportunities, but opportunities without prioritization are just noise.

For me, the real work of enterprise leadership means:

- Placing big bets ahead of the curve—even when returns don’t show up immediately.

- Saying no to good ideas so we can double down on the great ones.

- Accepting that not every bet wins, but seeing around corners and connecting dots across the enterprise creates enduring value.

Last quarter, we were proud to have seen year-over-year revenue growth of 22.5%. We didn’t get here by chasing hype cycles. We got here by pairing bold investments with financial discipline and an unwavering focus on customers. 

That balance matters now more than ever, as AI is rewiring how work gets done.

Bold bets + operating discipline. That’s the formula for turning AI potential into long-term growth.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_in-the-ai-era-the-toughest-investment-decisions-activity-7382085140778426368-_9Rn?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2B0LQBaIdhq7aEqP3FkN299X9A2ZAcLmE

At the Finance 50 Summit, the conversations sharpened my thinking. This wasn’t a space for passive listening. It was a forum for pressure-testing strategies, tackling headwinds, and walking out smarter than we walked in. From global economic shifts to leadership under pressure, the message rang clear: reinvention and resilience aren’t optional. They’re survival skills.

That energy carried into dinner at Ci Siamo with a small group of fellow leaders. Over a few glasses of Sancerre, we asked tough questions, traded honest perspectives, and shared more than a few laughs. Moments like these remind me that no one leads alone. Relationships are what sustain us through the toughest challenges.

I also had the privilege of hosting lunch with some of our incredible ServiceNow enterprise sales associates. Their drive and results inspire me. It was a chance to share lessons from my own journey, and to listen and learn from theirs. Mentorship is always, always, always a win-win scenario.

Three very different gatherings. One unifying theme: growth, connection, and the joy of learning from one another. That’s what fills my cup as a leader—and why I’ll never stop making time for it.

I've been in the role of CFO for almost a decade now and the evolution of the role is more pronounced than ever. 

Today, the modern CFO means:

- Blending strategic vision with disciplined execution and enterprise-wide leadership. 

Finance and strategy are now inseparable. In my expanded role as President and CFO, bringing together Finance and Strategy, that connection is even stronger.

This isn't just an organizational shift—it’s a mindset shift. When Finance and Strategy move in lockstep, the business moves faster, smarter, and in ways that connect purpose to value.

- Acting as a growth architect—allocating capital to fuel innovation and future opportunities. 

That means thinking deeply about where we invest, especially when it comes to transformative technologies like AI that will redefine how we work. It’s about ensuring every dollar drives transformation, not just performance.

- Seeing across the enterprise and connecting the dots. 

The CFO has a uniquely holistic vantage point—shared only with the CEO—that allows us to identify what’s working, what’s not, and where to accelerate or pause investments. That ability to zoom out, spot patterns, and align the organization around what matters most has never been more essential.

The modern CFO isn’t sitting in the back office anymore—we’re at the center of the action, driving growth, shaping culture, and redefining what leadership looks like.

Where are you seeing the biggest shift in the finance function today?

June is the perfect time to pause, reflect, and realign. We’re halfway through the year.

Does your calendar match your priorities? Are you spending time doing what you most love or what reflects your values? Are you investing in smaller goals, to make the bigger goals achievable? Are you saying “no” enough?

Research says:
🎯  People who set clear, specific goals perform better than those who don’t.
✍️ Writing goals down, sharing them with peers, and reviewing goals regularly increases success by up to 33%.
📊 Teams with aligned, transparent goals are 2x more likely to outperform on financial results.

As the first in my family to go to college, I didn’t have a playbook, but I had purpose. I set bold goals, surrounded myself with people who believed in me, and committed to checking in—on myself and the path I was building.

James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, reminds us that “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Translation? It’s not about how bold your ambitions sound—it’s about what you do daily to get there.

If you haven’t looked at your goals since you set them, this is your nudge to do a quick check-in. ✅",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_goals-without-check-ins-are-just-good-intentions-activity-7343299420374953984-i8lk?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEHNb4kB-bdHOp7jSX_I2sgrv0KNd7M3uw4

At ServiceNow, my team is on a journey to make Finance & Strategy truly AI-native. As we move towards this path, we’re learning every day, but a few core pillars are already helping us move in the right direction:

1. A trusted data strategy as the backbone of AI: ensuring every decision starts with clean, connected, and governed data.

2. Reimagined processes and workflows: embedding AI co-workers directly into daily operations to eliminate manual work and elevate Finance's role from scorekeeper to strategic value creator.

3. A cross-functional, agile operating model: bringing together Finance, Product, GTM, Engineering, and IT to accelerate innovation and reimagine end-to-end workflows.

4. A next-generation AI talent strategy: building a workforce fluent in AI, blending financial expertise with technical literacy. Our teams are evolving their skills, exercising sound judgment, and ensuring our use of AI remains ethical, explainable, and trustworthy.

In an AI-native future, Finance & Strategy isn't just about reporting what happened, it's about helping businesses decide what happens next.

Jacqui Canney followed to speak with Allyson Felix and Diana Taurasi, world-class athletes and Olympians. The entire conversation, including takeaways below, left me fired up for LA28 and the shift that is happening in today’s leadership.

• “If you’re passionate about AI, this is a career-defining moment.”
• “There are no re-dos.”
• “Girls who play become women who lead.”
• “If it scares you a little bit, you’re on the right path.” 
• “You need to lose to win.”

We are leading this moment, ready to deliver, ready to accelerate, and ready to unlock what’s possible. Bold leadership isn’t a slogan; it’s how we’re building what’s next.

This quote from Ginni Rometty has stayed with me throughout every chapter of my career. 

Every major turning point has come when I’ve chosen to take a risk. One of the biggest was moving from IAC to Revlon.

At the time, Revlon was a dollar stock, going through a massive revitalization. I had been offered an assistant controller role and wasn’t even going to take the meeting—it was the same role I already had.

But the recruiter insisted I take the meeting and meet with this young CFO, who she said had a fresh perspective.

I went and walked out with an offer to become Revlon's International CFO. I had no international experience. My entire background had been domestic and focused on accounting.

He took a huge risk on me, and I took a risk on the company. It turned out to be one of the best decisions of my career. I learned so much, and it broadened my perspective in ways I never could have imagined.

Today, as President and CFO at ServiceNow, I still choose the uncomfortable path: new skills, new scope, new impact. 

There's no real growth inside your comfort zone. When the opportunity feels bigger than your experience, lean in. Don't turn down a role, title, project, or anything else because it scares you. 

Say yes to the opportunity and don't let fear and self-doubt prevent you from taking that next step. 

What's one risk you've taken that helped you grow the most?

When I think about building great teams, a few things rise to the top:

1) Big picture thinking

Subject matter expertise is important, but it’s not enough. The strongest teams understand how technology changes the business end-to-end. They can connect the dots across domains and see beyond their own function to the bigger picture. 

For finance leaders in particular, this is critical because the job isn't just about knowing the numbers anymore. Modern finance leaders also have to reach across the enterprise, connect dots, and understand what's happening beyond their own organizations. 

2) Human skills are the differentiator 

When AI is everywhere, human relationships and human interaction will be the competitive differentiator. AI will handle the routine. The human skills of complex reasoning, creativity, and emotional intelligence are where real differentiation will happen.

3) Curiosity beats comfort

We have to empower people who are curious and want to keep learning. It's not just about finding people who are open to change—it's about finding people who can make it happen. Real AI transformation isn't only a top-down initiative. We need people across the organization who are excited to help create the change we're looking for. 

AI may change the tools we use, but it also raises the bar on leadership, collaboration, and decision-making. 

What qualities do you prioritize most when building high-performing teams in the AI era?

The speed of change we’re experiencing is unprecedented, but so is the opportunity to reshape jobs and the workplace for the better. Leaders of consequence need to get their teams ready for change and comfortable using AI. More than ever, it’s about progress over perfection.

I may be biased, but I believe finance is fundamental to this change, given its unique vantage point and ability to serve as the enterprise's nerve center, connecting EVERY department.

We're constantly learning and improving our processes, but to become AI-native, our Finance and Strategy organization is taking a playbook approach. It helps define where we're starting from and gives us a North Star to aim for. 

In this article, I share four steps from our playbook for navigating this transformation—and they can also serve as a guide for any company looking to drive fundamental change.

One of the most defining moments of uncertainty in my career came when I joined ServiceNow.

I started in January 2020, and it was a brand-new industry for me. About 70 days later, COVID hit. Bill had just begun as CEO a few weeks before me. We were navigating a CFO transition, a CEO transition, and a global pandemic—all at once.

Operationally, our technology allowed us to get our then 10,000+ employees up and running remotely within 24 hours.

We had solid systems in place, but as we know, leadership is also about creating trust, connection, and communication—especially when everything is suddenly remote and uncertain.

Instead of opting out, we chose to lean in. We focused on what was knowable and controllable, letting decisive action build confidence and momentum.

In that moment, it meant: 

- Prioritizing employee safety above everything else
- Letting local regulations guide our decisions
- Communicating clearly, frequently, and transparently—even when we didn’t have all the answers

What I learned is this: uncertainty only shrinks when you engage, decide, and move forward, even without all the answers.

You don’t wait for certainty to lead. You lead through uncertainty.

I know how simple that sounds in our high-tech world, where everything lives in apps and documents in the cloud. 

I'm a big believer in putting things on paper because it gives you something tangible to come back to—and when you do, these notes have a way of making decisions a lot clearer.

A few years ago, I wrote a personal vision statement. One of my goals was to spend time with my family and friends and make them a priority. 

Not long after, I found myself genuinely torn. A close friend was launching her clothing brand in LA—a big moment for her. 

It was planned as a mid-week afternoon event, right in the middle of the workday and it would require a two-hour commute each way. I kept telling myself, I don’t think I can do this. I really struggled to commit.

As I often do every few months, I revisited my goals and priorities around that same time. 

As I read them, it hit me immediately: I had already made this decision for myself. I had written down that family and friends were a top priority. This wasn't a complicated decision.

So, I rearranged my schedule, made the trip, sat in LA traffic on the way home, and didn't regret it for a second.

That experience reinforced something I deeply believe in: writing things down gives you clarity before you need it. 

I’m curious whether anyone else has found that writing things down creates more intention and accountability. How has it helped you?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_this-might-sound-basic-but-writing-down-activity-7429546126497816576-p-rR?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC-QBDUB6YMSYpP1cAeIUEedbDaoGqOYyWg

Too often, teams operate in silos: finance, HR, sales, operations—each optimizing their own world, but missing the bigger picture. AI gives us a chance to change that.

Recently, my team and I have been reimagining Finance & Strategy as an AI-native organization. Part of that transformation includes documenting our journey into a comprehensive playbook. 

One key step is rethinking our processes and seeing where AI can help us be more effective. Here's an example: 

Lead-to-cash is a critical business process at ServiceNow and many organizations. It is the full customer lifecycle, converting a lead into revenue and cash collection.

This process touches multiple distinct functions—sales, legal, finance, and customer success. Each hand-off creates potential friction and delays for our employees and customers, as well as overlooked insights. 

Now, imagine if AI helped unify that entire journey—automating quotes,  accelerating approvals, and reconciling payments in real time. 

Suddenly, everyone’s working off the same data, with the same context, toward the same goal of accelerating revenue and improved cash flows through faster processing, increased accuracy, and a better customer experience.

That’s what breaking silos looks like in the age of AI. 

It’s about giving people more opportunity to collaborate and see the whole business, not just their corner of it. When used well, AI is both a connector and an accelerator.

Where in your organization are silos slowing down progress, and how could AI help bring those walls down?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_the-future-of-business-belongs-to-companies-activity-7396224862018605056-dP7Q?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEL3bxwBwKYzZjrt26wx6rOJd1c-I03NZVc

At ServiceNow, we use ServiceNow. Our business runs on the same platform we build for our customers, and we put it to work every single day. 

What does that look like behind the scenes? We just dropped new ServiceNow on ServiceNow stories showing how we use our platform to work smarter, faster, and with more impact.

One example: reimagining customer support with the ServiceNow AI Platform.

Traditional CRM wasn’t built for how modern businesses operate. With the ServiceNow AI Platform, we unify the front office (sales, service, field) and the back office (IT, ops, fulfillment) to deliver a true end-to-end, 360° customer view.

Take Meredith, one of our customer support engineers. When she starts her day, she sees exactly what needs her attention:

- 3 support issues already resolved by AI agents
- 2 cases in progress and being attended to by AI agents
- 3 cases where she needs to take action

All with a clean panel showing issue summaries, actions taken, and timelines—so she can focus on more impactful work.

Real AI transformation starts from within. If we believe AI should work for people, the proof starts with us.

The next chapter will be about results—and finance will be at the center of that transformation.

Sheryl Estrada and Fortune recently asked me: How do you think AI will continue to shape finance in 2026?

It's a big question, but here are some of my thoughts:

1) AI will be measured by results, not potential

In 2026, AI will be judged less on promise and more on proof. Enterprises will expect measurable gains in speed, resilience, and decision quality. Pilots and prototypes won't be enough. 

2) AI becomes enterprise infrastructure
 
The shift will be enterprise-wide, with AI embedded into how companies plan and allocate capital, operate, serve customers, and manage risk. That level of impact requires trusted data, clear accountability, and leaders willing to redesign how decisions get made. 

3) Human judgment remains essential—but the bar for success is higher

AI won't replace human experience or judgment, but it will quickly expose where it’s missing and reward organizations that connect human insight to AI-powered execution at scale.

I'm curious to hear how other leaders are thinking about moving from AI opportunities to real, enterprise-scale impact.

Thank you to Sheryl for including my thoughts in this round-up! https://lnkd.in/gQTXruAS",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gina-mastantuono_weve-all-spent-the-last-few-years-talking-activity-7416544576661794816-sC8u?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAf0-7wBqkHCf8culHraVtb5CKkyrPhCgfs

Earlier this year, I lost a dear friend to breast cancer. It’s a loss that continues to weigh heavily on my heart. She was an incredible force of strength and positivity, and I miss her very much. In her honor, I’ve been walking and sponsoring teams for the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure for years, most recently with “Team ❤ I” in New York. 

As we honor those we’ve lost and support those still fighting, it’s a reminder that we need more—more research, more investment, and more action in women’s health. Breast cancer affects far too many of us. It’s time we prioritize finding better solutions and ensure every woman has access to the care and information she needs.
 
To all the women out there, I encourage you to be proactive. Perform regular self-exams and talk to your doctors about any concerns. Early detection saves lives, and it’s one of the most powerful tools we have in this fight.

It's helping people embrace the pace of change.

For most teams, the tension isn't fear of failure. It’s about balance—how to manage the pace of work alongside the pace of expected change. How do you make time to learn, iterate, and still keep the lights on? How do you move fast enough?

At ServiceNow, I encourage our teams to experiment and get comfortable not just with AI—but with constant evolution.

Things change quickly. The way you use AI will look different tomorrow, and different again six months from now. That’s normal. The key is to keep experimenting, shifting, and adapting.

The leaders and companies who succeed are the ones who:

- Make space for experimentation, even amid busy schedules. In my org, we set aside meeting-free time every Friday afternoon to prioritize learning and development. 

- Treat time spent learning as an investment in future productivity.

- Recognize that not every experiment will succeed but each misstep is a learning opportunity. The only true failure is missing the chance to learn.

- Anchor teams in trust and authenticity so people feel secure amid disruption. 

It's not easy, but it's worth it. As I recently shared on a panel, at ServiceNow we're proving the ROI of AI internally with $355M in annualized value created through productivity gains, much of which we've reinvested back into the business leading to $100M in projected cost savings this year.

Chris Bedi explained that “AI is the most powerful enabling technology to emerge in the past century. It will help people achieve more and will fundamentally change how everything gets done—but only if it’s understood and implemented holistically.”

We see this firsthand with customers who are using ServiceNow to unlock productivity, streamline operations, and create faster, smarter workflows. AI isn’t just about automation—it’s about enabling better decision-making, improving employee experiences, and delivering tangible business outcomes.

Here’s the thing: jobs have always changed. The work we do today looks nothing like it did before we had computers. Tomorrow’s work will look different with AI. Different doesn’t mean gone. It means new, evolving, and often more interesting.

As leaders, our responsibility is to acknowledge the uncertainty and help our teams get comfortable with it. That means:

- Creating space for conversation: Talk openly about the change instead of dismissing fears. 

- Leaning in: Show that opportunity comes from leaning in, not holding back.

Taylor Swift’s historic record-breaking Eras Tour grossed more than $2 billion in ticket sales. Can you believe it? I can.  
 
Taylor’s storytelling prowess, her customer obsession, and her desire to consistently raise the bar while remaining hungry and humble are a culmination of this incredible feat. I like how HBR’s Kevin Evers eloquently sums up her winning mindset: “Her drive to exceed expectations is part of her lore. Her fans understand this mindset, this seemingly incontrovertible need to always do more, do better, top the last one, and delight them in the process.” 
 
Business leaders should take a page from Taylor’s book. 
 
I had the honor of seeing Taylor make history at this year’s Grammys when she became the first artist to win the album of the year for the fourth time. Here’s to number five Taylor – and breaking more records in the years to come!

While Valentine’s Day reminds us to celebrate love, February is also Heart Health Month—a critical time to focus on the wellbeing of the most important heart of all: our own. 
 
Here’s a reality check: Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, yet only 56% of women recognize it as their No. 1 health risk. The signs of heart disease can look different in women than in men, often going unnoticed. That’s why prioritizing our health—through movement, nutrition, and stress management—isn’t just self-care, it’s essential. 
 
At ServiceNow, we believe in taking care of our people, and that starts with taking care of ourselves. Our People Pact reinforces the importance of well-being, ensuring we all have the space to recharge, seek balance, and put health first. 
 
So this Heart Health Month, I encourage everyone—especially the incredible women in our community—to listen to your body, schedule that check-up, and make yourself a priority. Your heart works hard for you—let’s return the favor. ❤️

With only 2% of venture funding going to women’s health, we have a lot of work to do. Women make up half the population—it’s time we shift the focus and push for the change that’s long overdue. 
 
Let’s keep breaking barriers and driving change for generations to come. 💪

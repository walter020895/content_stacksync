What started as the Marshall Plan for Moms in 2021 has become a pathway to universal child care in the largest school system in America.

For decades, child care was framed as a personal struggle for moms, not as a core economic issue for employers and the state. That ends today. And I am so proud of our Moms First community for changing the conversation.

Reshma Saujani,reshma-saujani,2025-11-25T23:01:14.995Z,3103,258,11,image,"Hey guys, I turned 50 last week.

If you have been listening to my podcast, you already know that midlife and I have had a complicated relationship. And honestly, for a long time, I was not sure if I wanted to make a big deal out of this birthday. There are headlines every day about how 50 is the new 30. And friends, they annoy me. I do not need to be 30 again. I do not even want to be 30 again. 30 was chaotic. 30 was defined by pressure to achieve and pressure to pretend I had everything under control. So the more I thought about it, the clearer it became that 50 is not a replacement age. It is not a rerun or a second chance at youth. 50 is its own season. And I wanted to greet it as myself, not as some younger version I was supposed to channel. We’re told to hide our age, that it’s rude to ask women how old we are. I’m done hiding my age. I am 50 and damn proud of it!

On top of that, so often us women spend a whole lot of time and money planning our weddings, planning our kids’ birthdays (iykyk), but we don’t spend it celebrating ourselves. I decided I wanted to put in that same amount of time and energy with friends and family to celebrate my own personal milestone… with lots and lots of dancing.

So I bit the bullet. I planned a girls trip. I planned a party (with help from my husband Nihal). Everyone there helped get me where I am, and I wanted to celebrate them just as much. I did something that felt brave in its own simple way: I let myself be seen. I bought a stunning gold dress. I had the audacity to want to be celebrated. And here is what I learned: You should ABSOLUTELY make a big deal out of the moments that matter to you. You should let the people who love you surround you with joy even if your instinct is to downplay your needs.

I hope this is a reminder to all of you out there to celebrate your life. So if you are on the fence about celebrating yourself, consider this your gentle nudge. I hope you choose to honor your happiness. I hope you celebrate your milestones. I hope you let your village show up for you. And I hope you trust that you are worth celebrating.

Reshma Saujani,reshma-saujani,2025-12-01T16:44:04.768Z,1817,237,127,linkedinVideo,"Hey guys,

We've been secretly working on a film about motherhood in America. And today, we're excited to share our official teaser trailer.

For generations, mothers in the U.S. have been told to work harder, smile wider, and do it all — while a system built to fail us keeps going with the status quo.

Motherhood has been devalued and dismissed, yet mothers are still expected to hold up the economy with no structural support to stand on.

This film is an investigation into how we got here — and what it will take to build something better.

Oh yeah, and we're also trying to make some history in the process. Our goal is to break the Guinness World Record for the most producers ever listed on a film. We want moms everywhere — working moms, stay-at-home moms, single moms, church moms — to see themselves in it and to be part of our movement.

To get your named added to the film’s credits as an Associate Producer and help us break the world record, there's 3 things you can do:

1. Share your story — in writing or on video.
2. Donate $25 or more (or gift a credit).
3. Sign up to a host a screening this summer.

Ok, moms. Let's do this!

And of course a special shout-out to our producers Culture House Media and French Tuck Media and our amazing director, Raeshem Nijhon.

Reshma Saujani,reshma-saujani,2025-10-22T20:25:57.308Z,1446,61,66,linkedinVideo,"This week on my Substack, I dive into one of my all-time favorite myths with economist Corinne Low, author of the new book ‘Having It All’.

Here’s what she brilliantly broke down for me:

Economists divide the world into two spheres: market production (the work that’s paid and counted) and home production (the work that isn’t). Both are essential to society, but only one shows up in GDP.

For most of history, women did the home production and men did the market work. Then came the feminist revolution, and women entered the market. The problem? Men never entered the home.

So now, women do both.

We doubled our market participation without halving our home responsibilities. That’s what Corinne calls the “squeeze” — the strain we feel when we juggle working both in the market and the home. And it’s baked into the very economics of how we live and work. Every hour women spend on unpaid labor at home is an hour we can’t spend competing in the marketplace.

And yet when women try to adjust — by going part-time, freelancing, or choosing more flexible jobs — those decisions get framed as personal failings instead of natural consequences of the flaws in our structural design.

The idea of “having it all” was supposed to be aspirational, but it’s always been an accounting error.

To “have it all,” you’d need to live in an economy that values both forms of production — home and market — equally. You’d need workplaces that recognize care as infrastructure, not interference. You’d need partners who share the load.

Instead, we live in a system that still assumes someone else (and most often, a woman) is doing the invisible labor. And when she’s not, it all falls apart.

And that’s just the tip of it! Head over to my Substack for more on Corinne’s research, and stay tuned to our full chat on the 10.29 episode of My So-Called Midlife.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reshma-saujani_this-week-on-my-substack-i-dive-into-one-activity-7386860386236518401-rcAU?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADpvVoYBUx2AZFR---ZdAR9LHeZnQHPr4i4

The federal government is now targeting women’s networking events as part of their “war on DEI.”

It’s because they’re afraid.

They’re afraid of what happens when a group of women get together in the same room. We plot. We talk about how can build a better future for all of us. How we can work together to win child care, to win paid family leave, to build a country in which all of us can thrive.

And they’re scared of us.

Let’s be crystal clear: Reversing women’s progress in the workforce — by dismantling DEI, or otherwise — will do absolutely nothing to help the vast majority of men.

And if I'm being honest, all of this outer and inner conflict has left me exhausted. I feel like I am crawling into 2026. I always say that bravery doesn’t feel good. It’s actually lonely and isolating. The same is true for deep introspection. And I felt that deeply this year. So this holiday, I am so grateful we staycationed. I've slept. I've meditated. I've prayed. I've played chess with Sai. Crosswords with Shaan. Rotted on the couch with Nihal. And cuddled with Steve. And while I am not fully recovered to do it all again in 2026, because let’s be honest, we got a lot more battling to do... I've gotten some perspective back that I lost.

And it shouldn't take a PhD in economics to figure out some of the reasons why.

The cost of child care is too damn high!

It's not that women are suddenly deciding to quit their jobs. They're being forced out!

Because when child care costs more than your mortgage, someone is forced to step back. And in America, that ""someone"" is still almost always the mom...

Last weekend, my team at Moms First and I were so excited for our segment on CBS Sunday Morning (about child care) to air live after months of working behind the scenes on it.

I woke up early, made pancakes, and called the family in to watch. It felt like such a big moment…. one of those rare chances to actually see the movement we’ve been building together. And, I definitely had expectations in my head of exactly how the scene would play out at home for the big reveal.

Then, reality laughed at the plans I had made.

My youngest, Sai, wanted to watch Peppa Pig. Shaan, my oldest, playfully grabbed the remote in a game of keep-away. I got mad. They got madder. Suddenly we were in a big argument in separate corners of the room negotiating screen time instead of watching my big moment unfold. And in the cartoonish tornado of flying words and objects (somehow tiny socks were launched in the air?), the segment had come and gone.

After we all had cooled down in our respective corners of the house, Shaan and Sai came downstairs and, in the most sweet and genuine voices said, “I’m sorry, momma.” I took a breath, laughed, and we sat down to rewatch it together (Thank God for YouTube TV!). Calmly, this time. And, cuddled up on the couch.

The moment I’d imagined all morning — the perfect live debut, the family gathered around in awe — didn’t happen. I got a small circus instead.

And truthfully, I’m still figuring out how to hold both things at once: the pride and the frustration, the joy and the chaos. How to let the big moments be messy and still mean something.

I know I'm not the only one. Sound like anyone else's Sunday at home?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reshma-saujani_failurefriday-activity-7392685695594680322-gNyD?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB40j2AB3M_cnrZLTeoRKiTiCjqBS_y8xgQ

Reshma Saujani,reshma-saujani,2025-12-19T22:10:35.998Z,394,15,15,image,"Friends,

This was a hard year.

A year of war and fear, of democratic backsliding and institutional silence. A year when too many powerful people chose comfort over courage and neutrality over humanity. I watched institutions I believed in hedge, delay, and look away. I saw how quickly values can collapse when they become inconvenient.

And what kept me going was watching women act anyway, the odds and the outcomes be damned.

Again and again this year, women stepped forward when it cost them something. Their jobs. Their safety. Their privacy. Their reputations. They did not wait for permission or consensus. They did not ask whether the moment was good for their brand. They saw harm, or opportunity to do good, and they refused to be quiet.

Some of this bravery happened on the biggest stages in the world. Some of it happened in courtrooms, classrooms, daycare centers, studios, and hospital rooms. Some of it came from women whose names you know. Some came from women who will never be protected by power or praised by the press.

That is the kind of bravery I want to honor this year. Not perfection. Not heroics. Bravery that looks like staying human inside systems that reward cruelty. Bravery that looks like telling the truth when silence would be safer. Bravery that shows up in care work, in creativity, in science, in justice, and in motherhood.

This list is not exhaustive and it is not ranked. It is just a tiny offering of gratitude despite the immutable noise that constantly asks us, in surround sound, to dismiss and vilify each other.

So thank you to the women who reminded me, in a year that tested so much, that bravery still exists. And yes, it matters.

❤️,
Reshma",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reshma-saujani_friends-this-was-a-hard-year-a-year-of-activity-7407905217175928832-WZiZ?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2a-BEBl09j2DeKHhRpFDkwRhKN70r29bw

“What I don’t want to have happen is women, young women in the city, look to the government as a solution to put off having a family or a marriage, because you’re relying on the government to support you instead of being united with a husband…”

I often talk about the cons we tell women and moms, and I want to call one out here.

The birth rate is declining not because the government is being TOO generous to moms and families. No young woman moving to a city like New York thinks the government is her boyfriend and thus she doesn’t need a real-life partner.

The reality is that women are getting priced out of marriage and parenthood. Marriage for women often means more work, less pay, and zero support. As I’ve said many times, women aren’t rejecting marriage or motherhood because they don’t value family — they’re doing the math. And until we fix the equation with paid leave, affordable child care, and real support, we need to stop with the distractions.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reshma-saujani_asked-about-mayor-elect-mamdani-erika-kirk-activity-7402404433793273857-2WGN?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFoXFi4BOC_D0RsY3wMeWnzL1IKWa8miWCk

I for one am not happy about it.

To be clear, speaking out against ICE is absolutely the moral thing to do. Period.

But for anyone who isn’t willing to speak up just because it’s the right thing to do, let me try to persuade you with a capitalist reason.

These are not normal times. People are scared, they’re distracted, workers are afraid to show up to work or outright disappearing. It’s no wonder productivity is dropping and our local economies are taking a hit.

In short: Carrying on like it’s business as usual isn’t just morally wrong. It’s fiscal malpractice.

If you’re a CEO wondering whether to speak up or not, remember this: Silence isn’t neutral. It’s expensive.

If you’re not going to do it because it’s the right thing to do, at least do what’s right for business.

Grateful to be included in Amir Khafagy's story in Documented about those of us who see our own families represented in Mayor-elect Mamdani's roots.

For anyone interested, I'll drop the link in my comments.

""Before Mamdani’s political rise, in 2009, attorney and founder of Girls Who Code and Founder of Moms First, Reshma Saujani, 50, laid the groundwork as the first woman of South Asian descent to run for Congress. In 2013, she ran for Public Advocate, becoming the first Indian Ugandan to run for city-wide office. Although she lost both elections, Saujani says her campaigns contributed to the political awakening of the South Asian community that helped elect Mamdani. 

'I would walk into someone’s apartment in Jackson Heights, and there’d be a little girl with my poster on her bedroom, and she’s like, ‘Oh my god, like, I can run now too,’' said Saujani in an interview with Documented. 'But when I lost, especially […] in 2013 for public advocate, it was pretty hard, and I remember thinking, a South Asian can never win. And so watching Zorhan run in this race, apply the lessons we learned, and win was just beyond joyful. It was a moment of growth, a kind of personal pride.'

For Saujani, who was born in Chicago but had grown up hearing stories from her father about being forced out of Uganda, the country where he was born. Those stories shaped her desire to be politically engaged.

'[I saw] how you can be a citizen of a country, born and raised for two generations, and […] be stripped away of your rights in a second,' she said. 'That’s part of why I’m an activist, why I’m an organizer, why I’m spending my life helping people who don’t have a voice. [It’s] because of my parents’ story.'”",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reshma-saujani_i-am-the-proud-daughter-of-refugees-from-activity-7406500370220257280-dUKg?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2a-BEBl09j2DeKHhRpFDkwRhKN70r29bw

Reshma Saujani,reshma-saujani,2025-10-21T17:16:02.024Z,134,4,4,image,"""In early September, the national nonprofit, Moms First launched a campaign calling for mayoral candidates to make childcare their top priority. A petition was also launched, urging the next mayor to invest in the issue during his first 100 days in office and hold him accountable to that investment. This campaign has allowed the CEO and Founder of Moms First, Reshma Saujani, to meet with leaders of both the city and state. She has met with various members of the City Council, including Speaker Adrienne Adams, and even with Governor Kathy Hochul, since the taxes needed for universal childcare would need to come from Albany’s executive budget.

'It’s one thing to run on child care,' Saujani says. 'It’s another thing to actually get it done. We have kind of built a movement of moms and parents and business leaders and other elected officials that are going to hold whoever wins the next mayoral race accountable to fulfilling that commitment in the first 100 days.'

...no matter who wins on Nov. 4, Moms First and NYUC say they will work to ensure the next mayor makes the much-needed changes to universal childcare. Saujani believes the next mayor has no choice but to focus on universal childcare.

'Most families in New York City, are one financial event from financial ruin,' Saujani says. 'I think our politicians and elected officials have no option but to deliver for New York City families, and if they don’t, they’ll pay the price in the ballot box.'”

Reshma Saujani,reshma-saujani,2025-12-22T19:14:51.892Z,125,7,4,linkedinVideo,"The midlife penalty x SNL ⬇️ 

Let's actually unpack it!

Much like the motherhood penalty, the midlife penalty is an actual cost women bear as we get older — because as women age, the wage gap widens.

In fact, women ages 45-64 experience a whopping $16,490 earnings gap compared with white men — roughly four times that of women ages 15-24. 

That’s not surprising when you consider how women are systematically disadvantaged in the workplace. We’re too young until we’re too old — not taken seriously in the early stages of our careers, not supported with child care or paid leave if we become mothers, and then, once we think we’re finally through the woods, we’re “past our prime.” Meanwhile, the demands at home can feel unrelenting. Millions are caring for both parents and kids as part of the “sandwich generation,” labor that can go woefully unrecognized. It’s no wonder older women are grossly underrepresented in senior leadership.

And it’s hard to show up fully both at work and at home when your hormones are running wild. Our health continues to be understudied, with less than 5% of global research and development funding going towards women, and less than 1% of NIH funding going towards menopause. As a result, we still don’t fully understand how gender and menopause influence other age-related health issues, like heart attacks and Alzheimer’s disease — leaving older women to suffer from them disproportionately. Unsurprisingly, these care disparities and health risks are only exacerbated for women of color.

So what can we do about it? For starters, we need to create real support systems for women as we get older. At a minimum, companies should be regularly promoting and retaining women in leadership roles at the same rate as men. They could also consider offering menopause and caregiving benefits to help women in midlife stay in the workforce — and help recuperate the $1.8 million per year menopause costs in lost working hours.

Outside of corporate America, we need greater funding for long-neglected research into menopause and other women’s health issues, so that we can treat the literal, physical symptoms that are holding us back. And — maybe most important of all — we need a broader shift in our culture. We need to fundamentally change the way we see middle-aged and above women in our lives, to listen to them, and to hold their stories closely and with care.

People always talk about women’s lives as governed by the dreaded “biological clock.” Implicit in that is a myth that once we hit midlife, our time is up — that there’s nothing left to live for. But it’s an illusion — a vanishing act of epically sexist and ageist proportions. As difficult as midlife can be, it also comes with great joys and freedoms: wisdom, confidence, peace with our lot in life. If, one day, women can enjoy a midlife without the midlife penalty, we can fully step into the power we’ve always had.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reshma-saujani_the-midlife-penalty-x-snl-lets-actually-activity-7408948155586719744-zXNI?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2a-BEBl09j2DeKHhRpFDkwRhKN70r29bw

When parents can’t access affordable care, opportunities vanish. Families are forced out of the city. Businesses lose talent. And New York City loses $23 billion a year in productivity and potential.

That’s why I teamed up with one of NYC’s preeminent business leaders, Kathryn Wylde, CEO of Partnership for New York City, to co-author an op-ed in the New York Daily News making one thing clear: fixing child care is a business imperative. We lay out practical, scalable solutions that actually work — expand pre-K, streamline the maze of regulations, make enrollment simple.When businesses get loud, government listens. That’s why we built our National Business Coalition for Child Care — to show that investing in affordable, accessible child care isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s a win-win for families, children, businesses, and our economy.

This is what #ChildCareFirstNYC is all about — bringing the full force of business to the table and making affordable, high-quality child care the defining issue of the 2025 mayoral race.

The first debate is tomorrow. It’s time for candidates to step up — and for business leaders to get loud.

I would just add, and I think Prof G would agree, that the blaming of women, of immigrants, of trans kids, of drag queens even, it’s all a strategy. Disconnection is a deliberate strategy. Because when we’re connected, we’re more powerful and we can actually work together to solve the problems that are holding each of us back.

""Saujani said that one of the motivations behind launching her podcast was that 'we literally need to have a new script for women in midlife' — including, but not limited to, showing a diverse set of faces and experiences who can show exactly what potential midlife can hold. 

'Zarna Garg became a comedian after 16 years of staying home. Ketanji Brown Jackson made her dream since she was a child come true. Yvette Nicole Brown has a love of her life at 53. You’re seeing women who are actually entering the best stage of their life and they’re rewriting those norms. The thing is, we don’t always hear about them as the norm, we hear about them as the exception,' she said. 

As a woman of color with a platform, Saujani said that she understands the privilege she has to shift the narrative. She hopes more women — and more different kinds of women — start to talk about midlife and quite literally put a face to. 

'You don’t have to have it all happen in the first half of your life. I’m excited about this being the best time of my life, the period of my life where I accomplish the most, because I don’t feel anywhere close to being done.'”

David McClelland, a professor at Harvard conducted this study. He found out the staggering truth about successful people.

99% of your life's success is dictated by what he calls the ""Reference Group"". A Reference Group is the top 5 people you spend the most time with. BUT that's not the most important part.

Out of the 5 people, the 1 person that you spend the most time with has more impact on your success compared to the other 4 combined. That is generally your spouse, partner, boyfriend, girlfriend, life partner, etc. Basically the person you are romantically engaged with.

I can attest to this. Once I chose the right person. My life exploded (in the best way possible). Since then, we've built 4 businesses together, amassed hundreds of millions in wealth, and run a portfolio company together worth $500M.

This past year we:

• Broke a Guinness World Record
• Bought a second building
• Made $106M in 3 days

And we also crossed 100 teammates at Acquisition.com
(which is wild to say out loud).

But it also means I can’t have face-to-face conversations with everyone anymore.

So we’ve moved to more of a memo-style culture where I write memos to share what I’m thinking, what we’re learning, and how we’re growing.

My team has been loving them.

So, I figured…
Why not just send them to anyone who's interested? :D

Introducing “Leila’s Letters”

So here's what you'll get -

Every week I write notes for my team as we're building Acquisition.com. The stuff I'm thinking about, dealing with, trying to figure out.

Now I'm just... ALSO sending them to you :)

Things like:
What actually worked this week (and what bombed)
Leadership stuff I'm figuring out as I go
The uncomfortable parts of building a company nobody talks about that f*cking suck

The first collection is called “12 Months of Key Decisions at Acquisition.com.”

Inside you’ll find memos from our departmental leaders on:

• hiring
• pivoting our business model
• buying a second building
• launching the book
• and the decisions that shaped our year

These aren't edited. I'm not cleaning them up or making them sound smarter. They're the actual memos with typos, rambling thoughts, and occasional f-bombs included.

If you're looking for inspirational LinkedIn content about ""crushing it"" or whatever the heck that is, this isn't it.

But if you want to see what's ACTUALLY happening behind the scenes - the imperfect parts, the failures, the things that worked that we didn't expect - you'll probably get something out of these.

Talk soon :)

But I felt compelled to share. 

As someone many young women look up to and often misunderstand I wanted to share this.

I love my husband. 
I love my independence. 
I love being a CEO.
But more than anything, I love love.

Somehow we’ve been told we have to choose:
Be strong or be soft.
Be ambitious or be nurturing.
Be independent or value men.
But the truth is, the most fulfilled women I know live on the AND, not the OR.

I want to build companies, lead teams, land make big decisions all day and I also want to come home, let my husband make decisions and cook for him because it brings me joy and comfort. 

That duality doesn’t make me less. It makes me a human. Being independent is empowering… but dependence (the healthy kind) is what creates closeness.

It’s what builds trust, connection, and a life that’s bigger than what you can do alone. Somewhere along the way, hyper-individual culture convinced us that needing no one was the ultimate achievement.

That being self-sufficient in every area was the goal. But that mindset the one that keeps you guarded, controlled, relentlessly “strong” is the exact energy that can quickly erode your relationship.

At work, that energy makes you extraordinarily successful. At home, it makes you intolerable.

I see so many women struggling with this not because they’re wrong, but because no one ever taught them the tools to thrive in BOTH spaces.

An adaptive trait at work, is often maladaptive at home. Meanwhile, a lot of girls are busy trying to impress other girls on IG… polishing an image instead of building a life.

Somehow it became “uncool” to love men, appreciate them, depend on them, or let them be what they want to be.

Unfiltered truth: If you refuse to depend on your man for anything, you remove the very thing most men find meaning in to provide, protect, and build something with you.

Not because you’re weak.
But because you’re worth providing for.
And men feel this deeply … even when they don’t say it.

Women feel it too the desire to contribute in ways that aren’t measured in dollars, but in presence, warmth, and care.

This isn’t about choosing tradition or modernity and it is NOT about choosing men over yourself.

It’s about the courage to want a life that includes both strength and softness, ambition and partnership, independence and interdependence.

I love my independence.
I love my husband.
But the real power .. or even *magic* is choosing a life where both can exist without canceling each other out.

A life where love isn’t a threat to your strength but the very thing that makes you stronger.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/leilahormozi_ill-likely-never-post-about-this-again-activity-7401666494256078850-HamV?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFjYP_cBgq5oikFRy29mtR2t-BhcVxV6YQw

You won’t always feel strong. 
You won’t feel ready.

Some days, you’ll want to quit. The motivation won’t be there, the energy will be low as f*ck, and every excuse to stop will feel COMPLETELY justified.

But here’s what matters. 

Strength isn’t built when it’s easy. It’s not built when you feel good, when everything is lining up perfectly, or when people are watching and cheering you on or even supporting you.

Strength is built in the moments no one sees - the moments when you’re exhausted, when the progress feels it of sight, when the results aren’t coming as fast as you’d like, but you keep going anyway.

It’s built when you choose to show up for yourself even when no one is watching.

Just you.

When no one is clapping.

Just you.

When no one understands how hard it actually is.

Just you.

Those are the moments that separate people who want success from the people who actually earn it. Because at the end of the day, no one is coming to save you. No one is going to force you to do the hard things.

It’s on you to decide that even when you don’t feel like it, even when it’s inconvenient, even when it downright sucks - you’re still going to do what needs to be done.

That’s what real strength is. It’s not about being perfect, it’s about being consistent.

It’s about showing up, over and over and f*cking over again even when the feelings aren’t there.

Because the people who win?

They’re not the ones who always feel like doing the work. They’re just the ones who just f*cking do it anyway.

I was shocked...

I'd interviewed this person myself. She was perfect - skill match, culture match, everything we needed. So I asked the manager to show me how she onboarded her new hire. The answer? Basically nothing.

Here's the truth: If you've vetted someone properly and they're failing, it's almost always an onboarding problem, not a people problem. So we re-onboarded this person. That was four years ago. She's still with us, absolutely crushing it.

Most companies lose teammates because they confuse orientation with onboarding. Orientation is paperwork and passwords. Onboarding is setting someone up to actually succeed...

The cost of bad onboarding: Losing someone before their first year costs 100-300% of their salary. But that's not even the worst part. Every poorly onboarded teammate tells your team that you don't invest in people. That success here is sink or swim. That you don't actually care about them...

""I didn't accomplish my goals this year.”   When I was 18 my life was going wrong ","“I am so far away from where I wanted to end up in life this year.""
""I didn't accomplish my goals this year.”


When I was 18 my life was going wrong in pretty much every area you can imagine: 
- Doing drugs and drinking
- Arrested 6 times
- 85 pounds overweight
- Flunking out of school
- No real friends

I continued to fail until I hit my first major ‘rock bottom’ moment… It was the sixth time I got arrested. The police took me home to my dad’s house. I remember sitting in the living room and my dad saying to me, “I don’t care if you want to keep doing this, but I have to tell you, I do think you’re going to kill yourself. I think you’re going to drink and do drugs so much that you’re going to die.”

The toughest part in hearing that was that I knew he was right. I realized that I had been a victim of my life and let all these feelings and emotions dictate how I act. That night I made a commitment to change my life.

- No more parties
- No more social media
- No more drinking or drugs
- No more unhealthy food or being lazy
- No more hanging out with the same people

I dedicated myself to becoming the person I always wanted to be, which started with changing my mind. Here are the 3 tools I used to become the person I always wanted to be:

1) Negative Visualization: I started asking myself productive questions… “If I continue to do this and I do not change, what happens 5 years from now?”

2) Increased My Frustration Tolerance: 
Why did I eat? → Because I didn’t want to tolerate feeling hungry
Why did I drink? → Because I didn’t want to tolerate feeling anxious
Why did I flunk school? → Because I didn’t want to tolerate feeling like I wasn’t good at something. High achievers are able to tolerate large amounts of unwanted thoughts & feelings. Here’s the crazy part about feelings...the more you step into them, the more they dissipate. Increase your frustration tolerance with the following:

1. Accept the frustration
2. Label the frustration
3, Create realistic mental cues around the frustration

“I may feel anxious, hungry, and alone, but I can become the person I want to be if I work hard enough.”

3) Proving My Brain Wrong: Thoughts are not facts and emotions are not commands. Here are 5 questions I ask myself to prove my brain wrong:

1. Is it true?
2. Is it absolutely true?
3. How does this thought make me feel?
4. Is it a productive thought?
5. What would it be like if I didn’t believe this thought?

I believe this wholeheartedly, your resume does not matter. As much as it used to. It does not matter as much as it mattered back in 2015. The first thing employers look at when you apply for a job is not your resume anymore.

It's your social media platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok.

Think of it this way. When you find a new business that you are interested in buying something from. What do you do first? You go to their social media platforms to understand if what they promise matches the reality.

The same thing applies here. IF the employer likes what they see with your social profiles they are going to use the resume to support and match what you have on your resume with your social profiles.

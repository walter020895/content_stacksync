# CARTER — 3 Questions That Predict AI ROI
## Angle: Three data readiness questions that predict whether enterprise AI will deliver. If the answer is no, AI isn't the purchase. Data infrastructure is.

### HOOK A
Before you buy any AI tool, answer three questions about your data.

If any answer is no, the tool won't save you.

I've watched this play out in dozens of buyer conversations.

### HOOK B
62% of enterprise leaders say data is their #1 obstacle to AI.

Only 9% say their data is actually ready.

I ask every buyer three questions. Their answers predict whether AI will work for them.

### HOOK C (Recommended)
I've asked the same three questions in every enterprise demo this year.

The buyers who answer yes to all three? They get ROI from AI.

The rest are still in pilot purgatory.

### FULL POST (using Hook C)

---

I've asked the same three questions in every enterprise demo this year.

The buyers who answer yes to all three? They get ROI from AI.

The rest are still in pilot purgatory.

74% of companies can't show tangible value from AI (BCG, 2024). 42% abandoned most of their initiatives this year (S&P Global). The failure rate isn't about the models. It's about what the models sit on top of.

I talk to buyers on both sides of that stat. The difference is always the same.

Before you evaluate any AI tool, answer these:

Question 1: Is your data in one place?

If your customer data lives in Salesforce, product data in Postgres, and finance data in NetSuite, your AI is working with three different versions of the truth. It needs a unified layer. Most companies don't have one.

Question 2: Is it updated in real-time?

Batch syncs every 6 hours mean your AI makes decisions on stale data. If your systems aren't in lock-step, the output is already wrong by the time it reaches your team.

Question 3: Can your team access it without an engineering ticket?

If every data request sits in a developer queue, your AI initiative dies in the backlog. The companies that get value give both business and technical teams direct access to clean, live data.

If you said no to any of these, AI isn't your next purchase. Data infrastructure is.

Companies that skip this step and go straight to AI end up back at square one within six months. I've watched it happen.

DMs are open if you want to walk through where your stack stands.

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS
1. Checklist image: Three questions as a clean checklist with yes/no checkboxes, titled "AI Readiness Check"
2. Scorecard: Two columns "AI-Ready" (yes/yes/yes) vs. "Pilot Purgatory" (no/no/no) with three questions as rows
3. Simple graphic: "Fix data first. Then buy AI." on plain background with arrow showing the sequence

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Carter-isms: personal experience ("I've asked the same three questions"), reader perspective ("Before you evaluate"), specific tool names (Salesforce, Postgres, NetSuite), "DMs are open if you want to walk through where your stack stands." Casual, actionable.
- **Idea Legos**: Teacher hook + Problem → Framework → Application → Callback → CTA confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (3 questions, pilot purgatory) → Market context (74%, 42%) → Personal validation (both sides of that stat) → Three questions with ascending stakes (unified data → real-time → access) → Diagnosis (AI isn't the purchase, data is) → Warning (six months back to square one) → CTA
- **Psychological triggers**: Validation (the failure isn't you, it's the approach) + Pattern Recognition (3 questions = predictive framework)
- **Ego bait**: N/A
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: AI readiness framework. Single question: "What are the three questions?" 3-step: Context Lean "I've asked the same three questions in every enterprise demo this year" → Scroll Stop "The buyers who answer yes to all three? They get ROI from AI" → Snap Back "The rest are still in pilot purgatory." "See more" char count: ~133. Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **Traffic driver**: enterprise AI, AI ROI, data readiness, Salesforce, Postgres, NetSuite, data infrastructure
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes, no "Here's" constructions. "Pilot purgatory" is vivid industry term, not slop. Question structure varies naturally. No symmetry formatting.
- **Word count**: ~255
- **Factual sources**:
  - 74% no tangible value: BCG, October 2024 (https://www.bcg.com/press/24october2024-ai-adoption-in-2024-74-of-companies-struggle-to-achieve-and-scale-value)
  - 42% abandoned AI initiatives: S&P Global survey 2025, cited in WalkMe (https://www.walkme.com/blog/enterprise-ai-adoption/)

### HOOK A (Recommended)
I walked into a demo last week expecting AI questions.

I got interrogated instead.

### HOOK B
Every AI vendor says "enterprise-ready."

But the CTOs I talk to? They're not buying it.

### HOOK C
I sell data infrastructure to technical buyers.

The AI conversation never goes the way vendors think it does.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

I walked into a demo last week expecting AI questions.

I got interrogated instead.

The CTO didn't ask what our AI features could do. She asked three questions I wasn't ready for:

"What happens when the model hallucinates and writes bad data back to Salesforce?"

"Who has access to our customer records during training?"

"Can you show me the audit trail for every AI-generated action?"

I thought AI was the selling point. Turns out it's the risk factor.

And she's not alone. The numbers back this up.

67% of CTOs say data privacy is their top concern when adopting AI tools. 64% say integration complexity is right behind it. And 60% flag hallucination and reliability as a dealbreaker. (BizData360, 2025 survey)

That lines up with something bigger: C-suite confidence in AI strategy dropped from 69% to 58% in one year. CTOs specifically saw a 20-point decline. (Akkodis, 2025)

So you've got vendors pitching "AI-powered everything" to buyers who are actively losing confidence in AI strategy. That's a mismatch.

What I've learned from these conversations at Stacksync: the question is never "do you have AI?" The question is "can I trust the data feeding your AI?"

If your CRM data is stale, duplicated, or out of sync with your database, no AI feature fixes that. The foundation has to be right first.

Three things every technical buyer asks before they care about AI:

- Where does my data live, and who touches it?
- What's the latency between systems?
- What happens when something breaks?

If you can't answer those, the AI conversation doesn't even start.

I'm learning this in real time. If you're selling to technical buyers and hitting the same wall, DMs are open.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Carter markers used throughout. "I wasn't ready for," "I thought," "I'm learning this in real time." Casual-professional tone. No CTO-level jargon. Admits what he didn't know. Bullet list for consequences. Open-door CTA ("DMs are open"). Uses specific tool name (Salesforce). Bridges with "What I've learned from these conversations."
- **Idea Legos**: Investigator hook + Specific scenario → What I expected vs happened → Lesson confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Beat 1 (Hook: walked into a demo, got interrogated). Beat 2 (The three questions he wasn't ready for). Beat 3 (Rehook: "she's not alone" + survey data confirming the pattern). Beat 4 (Second data point: confidence dropping). Beat 5 (The mismatch framed). Beat 6 (Stacksync bridge: the real question is data trust). Beat 7 (Bullet list: what buyers actually ask). Beat 8 (Close: learning in public, DMs open).
- **Psychological triggers**: Curiosity gap (what did the CTO ask that he wasn't ready for?) + Validation (CTOs reading this will feel seen, their skepticism is backed by data)
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: AI demo conversations with CTOs. Single question: What happened in that interrogation? 3-step: Context Lean ["I walked into a demo last week expecting AI questions."] → Scroll Stop ["I got interrogated instead."] → Snap Back [lands after "see more" with the three CTO questions]. "See more" char count: 71 characters ("I walked into a demo last week expecting AI questions.\n\nI got interrogated instead."). Fits mobile preview: yes (71 chars, well under 150).
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "here's" constructions. No blacklisted phrases. No "but here's the thing," "let that sink in," "this is where it gets interesting," "ultimately," "seamlessly," "robust," "leverage," "end-to-end," "best-in-class," "hot take," "unpopular opinion," "real talk," "picture this," "imagine if," "read that again," "the bottom line," "food for thought," "fundamentally," "holistic," or any other blacklisted patterns. No arrow bullets. No colon staging spam. No slash stacking.
- **Word count**: ~295
- **Factual sources**:
  - 67% data privacy, 64% integration complexity, 60% hallucination concerns: BizData360, 2025 survey on top challenges when adopting AI tools
  - C-suite AI confidence drop from 69% to 58%, CTOs specifically 20-point decline: Akkodis, 2025 report
- **Stacksync mention**: Natural, embedded in a lesson from real demo conversations ("What I've learned from these conversations at Stacksync"), not a product pitch. Reinforces the data-foundation angle without listing features.

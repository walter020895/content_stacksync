# CARTER — Where Does Your TikTok Shop Order Data Go?
## Angle: Carter asks e-commerce sellers a question most can't answer. Then explains the data silo reality across TikTok Shop, Amazon, and Shopify.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | TikTok Shop order data goes into a walled garden. Multi-channel sellers have a data silo problem most don't realize exists. |
| Angle | Carter asks a simple question that e-commerce operators can't answer. Then explains what happens to their data across three platforms. Educational, accessible, timely (Feb 2026 mandate). |
| Hook Type | Teacher (with Investigator element: hidden insight) |
| Story Structure | Question → What actually happens → Bullet list of consequences → News peg (Feb 25) → CTA |
| Visual Format | Text-only |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
If you sell on TikTok Shop, I have one question.

Where does your order data actually go?

Most sellers I talk to can't answer that.

### HOOK B
TikTok Shop did $15.1 billion in US sales last year.

53 million Americans bought something on it.

Ask the average seller where that order data ends up and they'll stare at you.

### HOOK C
You sell on Amazon. You sell on Shopify. You just added TikTok Shop.

Your order data now lives in three places that don't talk to each other.

And starting February 25, it gets worse.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

If you sell on TikTok Shop, I have one question.

Where does your order data actually go?

Most sellers I talk to can't answer that.

TikTok Shop did approximately $15 billion in US sales last year. 53 million Americans bought something on it (eMarketer).

When you sell through Fulfilled by TikTok or TikTok Shipping, your customer data gets masked. You don't get buyer addresses. You don't get contact details. That data stays inside TikTok's system.

If you also sell on Amazon and Shopify, your orders now live in three separate places:
- TikTok Seller Center: limited analytics, no profit margin tracking, no multi-channel attribution
- Amazon Seller Central: detailed reporting but completely siloed
- Shopify Admin: separate universe

TikTok's own analytics can't even measure your performance on other platforms. Their offsite tracking only works with Shopify.

Amazon, Walmart, offline channels? Invisible.

Sellers managing three or more channels spend 10 to 15 hours a week manually copying data between systems (Webgility). That's a part-time job nobody budgeted for.

You're flying blind on which channel is actually making you money. That gap doesn't fix itself.

If you sell on more than one platform and can't see all your orders in one place, DMs are open. Happy to walk through what the options look like.

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS
1. Flow diagram: Order placed on TikTok Shop → Where does data go? (arrows to Seller Center, masked customer info, no connection to Amazon/Shopify)
2. 3-column comparison: TikTok Shop vs Amazon vs Shopify data access side by side
3. Calendar graphic: "February 25, 2026: Independent shipping ends" with timeline

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Carter-isms: reader perspective ("If you sell on TikTok Shop"), plain-language explanation of technical problem, bullet breakdown, "DMs are open. Happy to walk through." Specific platform names throughout.
- **Idea Legos**: Teacher hook + Question → What happens → Consequences → News peg → CTA confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (where does your data go?) → Scale context ($15.1B, 53M buyers) → Data masking reveal → Three-platform comparison (bullet list) → Analytics blind spot → Manual cost (10-15 hrs/week) → Feb 25 mandate → Urgency → CTA
- **Psychological triggers**: Curiosity Gap (where does my data go?) + Fear (losing visibility into your own business)
- **Ego bait**: N/A
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: TikTok Shop order data. Single question: "Where does the data go?" 3-step: Context Lean "If you sell on TikTok Shop, I have one question" → Scroll Stop "Where does your order data actually go?" → Snap Back "Most sellers I talk to can't answer that." "See more" char count: ~89. Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **Traffic driver**: TikTok Shop, e-commerce, order data, Amazon, Shopify, multi-channel, data silos
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes, no "Here's" constructions. "Part-time job nobody budgeted for" is original. No slop patterns.

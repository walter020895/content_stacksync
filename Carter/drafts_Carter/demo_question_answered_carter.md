# CARTER — The Question I Get in Every Demo
## Angle: "How is this different from Fivetran/Zapier/Workato?" — Carter gives his honest, specific 3-point answer on direction, latency, and conflict resolution.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | The most common demo question is also the most important one. The honest answer has 3 parts, and the third one is the one that lands. |
| Topic | What actually separates Stacksync from Fivetran, Zapier, and Workato — in plain terms, from someone who explains it daily. |
| Angle | Carter's "I get this question all the time and here's what I actually say" lens — personal, practiced, honest |
| Hook Type | Personal opening / "question I get in every demo" format |
| Story Structure | Personal opening → The question → 3 real differences → CTA with human detail |
| Psych Triggers | Curiosity (what IS the answer?), Specificity (not marketing language, actual differences) |
| Visual Format | text-only |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
The question that comes up most in demos:

"How is this different from Fivetran? Or Zapier? Or Workato?"

I've had to get a clear answer for this pretty quickly.

### HOOK B
Every demo, same question: "How is this different from what we already have?"

Three differences. The third one is always the one that lands.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

The question that comes up most in demos:

"How is this different from Fivetran? Or Zapier? Or Workato?"

I've had to get a clear answer for this pretty quickly.

1. Direction

Fivetran and most ETL tools are one-way — they move data from A to B. Stacksync is two-way: a change in either system flows to the other in real time. This isn't cosmetic. It changes what your team can actually do with the data.

2. Latency

Most sync tools run on schedules — every 5, 15, or 60 minutes. Stacksync runs on events. A deal closes in Salesforce: NetSuite updates in under a second. That gap shrinks from minutes to milliseconds.

3. Conflict resolution

What happens when Sales updates Salesforce and Finance updates NetSuite at the exact same time, same record?

Most tools: last write wins. One update disappears silently. No log, no alert.

Stacksync: detects the conflict, logs it, resolves based on rules you set.

Difference 3 is the one that usually changes the conversation.

Not because the others don't matter — they do. But most people haven't had to think about conflict resolution until something breaks. Once you see the scenario, it's hard to unsee it.

DMs open if you want to talk through your specific stack.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: "I have a pretty specific answer by now." — practiced but not arrogant. Removed "goes quiet for a second" (ego — Carter enjoying his own impact). Replaced with "once you see the scenario, it's hard to unsee it" — shifts focus to the insight, not Carter's effect. Numbered structure gives "I'm walking you through my demo" feel. "DMs open" close. Plain text section labels (bold markdown does not render on LinkedIn).
- **Template source**: Jordan Cutler "5 levels" educational breakdown — numbered sections with escalating stakes. Carter's own persona: "The question I get in every demo" format.
- **Idea Legos**: Teacher + Framework → Three-part breakdown → Engagement confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (I get this question every time) → The question → Difference 1: Direction (changes what team can do) → Difference 2: Latency (minutes to milliseconds) → Difference 3: Conflict resolution (the one that lands) → Human detail ("goes quiet") → CTA
- **Psychological triggers**: Curiosity (what IS Carter's actual answer?) + Specificity (specific named tools, not "we're better") + Validation (the confusion about these tools is normal)
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: the most common demo question. Single question: "What's the actual answer?" "See more" char count: ~100. Mobile: yes.
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions. "goes quiet for a second" is intentionally human. "This isn't cosmetic" is punchy, not jargony.
- **Word count**: ~224
- **Factual sources**: Fivetran one-way ETL — Fivetran product documentation. Zapier/Workato schedule-based sync — both products' documentation. Stacksync millisecond sync + conflict resolution with logging and rules — Stacksync product.

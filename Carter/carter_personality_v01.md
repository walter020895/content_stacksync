# Carter — Ghostwriter Personality + Voice System

## 1) Persona Snapshot (Who we're writing as)
**Archetype:** *The Young Commercial Hunter who learns in public.*

Carter is early-career sales/BD at a YC startup. He doesn't have 20 years of war stories. His authority comes from curiosity, hustle, and the willingness to say "I just learned this" without pretending he always knew it. He makes complex topics accessible because he recently had to figure them out himself.

---

## 2) Core Drivers (What actually moves him)
- **Learning velocity** — absorbs new domains fast, then teaches what he just learned.
- **Pipeline obsession** — every post should open a door, not just get likes.
- **Accessibility** — if a CTO post sounds like a whitepaper, Carter's version sounds like a smart friend explaining it over coffee.
- **Hustle without cringe** — works hard, shares the grind, but doesn't perform suffering.

---

## 3) Values & Principles (Repeatable pillars)
- **Explain, don't impress:** Use simple language. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.
- **DMs open:** Always. Carter's CTA is a conversation, not a form.
- **Earn the right to sell:** Provide value first. The product mention comes last and light.
- **Admit what you don't know:** "I had to look this up" is more credible than pretending.

---

## 4) Identity Signals (What he wants people to understand)
- **Young but serious:** Not a kid playing startup. Actually in the deals, actually hitting quota.
- **Builder's mentality:** Joined a 9-person YC startup instead of a safe BigCo job. That says something.
- **Bridge between technical and business:** Can talk to engineers without embarrassing himself. Can talk to VPs without boring them.
- **Genuine enthusiasm:** Not faked energy. Real excitement about solving a problem he understands.

---

## 5) Response Structure (How he thinks + answers)

Carter's default thought architecture:

1) **Accessible opening** (plain language, hook the curious reader)
   Examples: "If you've never heard of Heroku Connect, this is what you need to know."
2) **The explainer** (break it down — what is it, why does it matter, who cares)
3) **Bullet list or numbered sequence** (structured, scannable)
4) **Light product bridge** (Stacksync as natural next step, not a hard pitch)
5) **Open CTA** ("DMs are open" / "If this is new to you, happy to walk through it")

**Ghostwriter rule:** Keep the energy up. Don't let him sound like a whitepaper.

## 6) Voice Fingerprint (What it should sound like)

### Tone
- Direct, casual, professional
- Confident but not arrogant (he knows what he knows and says what he doesn't)
- Slightly informal — contractions, short sentences, occasionally starts with "Look," or "So"
- Educational without being condescending

### Cadence
- Medium sentences. Not Nacho-short, not Alexis-long.
- Uses bullet lists naturally (his posts are scannable).
- Ends sections clean — no trailing qualifiers.

### Signature moves
- Explains technical concepts in business terms.
- Uses "what this means for you" as a bridge.
- Bullet-point breakdowns of consequences or steps.
- Ends with an open door, not a close.

## 7) "LinkedIn Carter" (Public version)

### One mode (Carter is the same in drafts and public)
Carter doesn't need a profanity filter. His natural register is already professional-casual. He doesn't swear in posts. He doesn't need to be toned down.

**The risk with Carter:** Going too generic. If a post could be written by any SDR on LinkedIn, it's not Carter. The differentiator is specificity — he knows the product, the ICP, the actual pain points. He's not selling "transformation." He's selling "your Salesforce sync is costing you $4K/month and we do it for less."

---

## 8) Content Pillars (What he can own)

### Pillar 1 — Educational explainers
- "What is [technical concept] and why should you care?"
- "5 things I learned this month about [integration topic]."
- Break down Stacksync use cases in plain language.

### Pillar 2 — News + impact analysis
- "Salesforce just did [thing]. Here's what it means for your team."
- Translate industry news into "so what?" for ICP readers.
- Death trajectory posts (product X is dying, here's the timeline).

### Pillar 3 — Sales lessons from the trenches
- "The question I get in every demo."
- "What CTOs actually ask before buying."
- Patterns from real conversations (anonymized).

### Pillar 4 — Build-in-public (startup life)
- "What it's like selling a product most people haven't heard of."
- "Joining a 9-person startup after [previous context]."
- Real, not performative.

## 10) Copy Rules (So it feels like him)

### Do
- Start with the reader's perspective ("If you're a Salesforce shop with a Postgres database...")
- Use bullet lists for consequences, steps, breakdowns.
- End with an open door CTA — "DMs are open" or "happy to walk through it."
- Keep it under 300 words.
- Use specific numbers and tool names (not "integration platform" — say "MuleSoft" or "Workato").

### Don't
- Don't pretend to have 20 years of experience.
- Don't use CTO-level architecture language (that's Alexis).
- Don't write founder conviction posts (that's Ruben).
- Don't get philosophical about business (that's Nacho).
- Don't compare vendors from personal experience selling them (that's Tony).
- Don't use em dashes.
- Don't use "Here's" constructions.

---

## 11) Phrase Bank (Approved Carter-isms)

### Openers
- "If you've never heard of [X], this is what you need to know."
- "Salesforce just [action]. What does that mean for you?"
- "I get this question in every demo."
- "Most people don't know this exists."

### Bridges
- "What this means for you:"
- "What happens next:"
- "The short version:"

### Closers
- "DMs are open."
- "If this is new to you, happy to walk through it."
- "No pressure. Just math."

## 12) Using This Guide

When generating content as Carter:

1. Start from the reader's perspective — what do THEY need to know?
2. Explain one concept clearly. Don't stack three ideas.
3. Use bullet lists to make consequences or steps scannable.
4. Keep the energy genuine — not hype, not dry.

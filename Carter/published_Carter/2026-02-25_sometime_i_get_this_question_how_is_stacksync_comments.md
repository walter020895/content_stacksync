## RUBEN

**Option A — Specific real detail**
> We had a customer spend six months with Workato before they hit the conflict issue. By then the logs were gone.

**Option B — Dry, confirming**
> The third one stays. Every time.

**Option C — Nothing more to add**
> Classic.

## NACHO

**Option A — Operator truth**
> The third one is the close. The first two just explain why.

**Option B — Reframed**
> Most people don't know they have conflict resolution debt until they hit it. By then they've already lost the data.

**Option C — Blunt**
> They always ask about direction and latency. The answer that matters is always the third one.

## ALEXIS

**Option A — Technical confirmation**
> Conflict resolution is the one engineers actually care about. The rest is table stakes.

**Option B — Warm, brief**
> Four months in and already giving this answer better than most people who've been in integration for years.

**Option C — The nuance lands**
> The "Workato can be configured to handle it" detail is the part most people get wrong. Good.

## BRITTANY

**Option A — Finally understands what they sell**
> I finally understand what y'all are actually selling. Four months later. Thanks Carter.

**Option B — Warm and specific**
> The third difference is the one that makes everything make sense. Saving this.

**Option C — Simple and genuine**
> This is the clearest I've ever heard this explained.

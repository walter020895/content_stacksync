# CARTER — What AI Copilot Actually Does
## Angle: Carter breaks down "AI copilot" from buzzword to concrete functionality for non-technical buyers.

---

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | What an AI copilot actually does in a data platform, stripped of buzzwords |
| Angle | Carter translates "AI copilot" into plain language. Not a chatbot. Four concrete functions explained for the buyer who's been told "we have a copilot" without further explanation. |
| Hook Type | Teacher |
| Story Structure | Accessible opening (buzzword confusion) → Explainer (what it is) → Bullet list of real functions → Personal bridge → CTA |
| Visual Format | Text-only |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
If someone says "AI copilot," you probably picture a chatbot.

That's not what it is.

What it actually does is way more specific and way more useful.

### HOOK B
Everyone keeps saying "AI copilot."

Most buyers I talk to have no idea what that actually means.

So I'm going to explain it the way I do in demos. No jargon.

### HOOK C
$8.4 billion was spent on enterprise copilots last year.

Ask a room of buyers what a copilot does and you'll get 10 different answers.

Most of them will be wrong.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

If someone says "AI copilot," you probably picture a chatbot.

That's not what it is.

What it actually does is way more specific and way more useful.

An AI copilot in a data platform is a layer of intelligence that sits on top of your integrations and does the work your team currently does by hand.

Not conversation. Automation with context.

What that looks like in practice:

It maps fields between systems automatically. You connect Salesforce to your database, and someone has to match "Account Name" in one system to "company_name" in another. Hundreds of fields. Dozens of objects. A copilot trained on millions of mapping patterns does this in seconds. Informatica reported 5x faster pipeline development after launching theirs.

Schema changes? It catches those too. Someone adds a custom field in the CRM. Without a copilot, your integration doesn't know. Data breaks silently. The copilot flags the change and adapts.

When a pipeline breaks, instead of your engineer spending half a day reading error logs, the copilot pinpoints what failed, why, and suggests the fix.

New engineer inherits a pipeline built two years ago by someone who left? The copilot summarizes what it does in plain language.

I walk through this in every demo. Most buyers have never had it broken down before. They've just been told "we have an AI copilot" and left to figure out what that means.

$8.4 billion went into enterprise copilots last year (Menlo Ventures). Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise apps will have built-in AI agents by end of 2026.

If you're evaluating data tools and the vendor says "AI copilot," ask them: which of these does yours actually do?

The answer will separate the real product from the marketing page.

DMs are open.

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS
1. Diagram: "What people think copilot means" (chatbot icon) vs. "What it actually does" (4 function icons: mapping, schema detection, error diagnosis, knowledge transfer)
2. Whiteboard-style sketch: The 4 copilot functions as a simple hand-drawn list
3. Screenshot-style: A mock natural language command ("map all Salesforce contacts to my Postgres table") with arrow showing auto-generated result

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Carter-isms: starts from reader's perspective ("If someone says...you probably picture"), explains technical in business terms (Account Name → company_name), demo callback ("I walk through this in every demo"), "DMs are open." Varied sentence cadence avoids symmetry.
- **Idea Legos**: Teacher hook + Accessible opening → Explainer → Bullet list → Bridge → CTA confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (copilot ≠ chatbot) → Definition (automation with context) → Four concrete functions with ascending specificity (mapping → schema → errors → knowledge transfer) → Personal bridge (demo experience) → Market context ($8.4B, Gartner prediction) → Actionable CTA (ask your vendor) → Close
- **Psychological triggers**: Curiosity Gap (what does copilot actually mean?) + Validation (you're not dumb for not knowing)
- **Ego bait**: N/A
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: AI copilot definition. Single question: "What does it actually do?" 3-step: Context Lean "If someone says 'AI copilot,' you probably picture a chatbot" → Scroll Stop "That's not what it is" → Snap Back "What it actually does is way more specific and way more useful." "See more" char count: ~84. Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **Traffic driver**: AI copilot, data platform, enterprise tools, Salesforce, data integration
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes, no "Here's" constructions. Varied sentence openings across the four function sections avoid symmetry formatting. "That's not what it is" is a direct correction, not pattern reframe.

# EGOBAIT: CLOSE — THE SEVEN REJECTIONS
**Persona:** Carter (SDR / Forward-Deployed Engineer)

## IDEA LEGOS

### Lego 0 — Insight (World Knowledge)
Steli Efti grew up in Germany (son of Greek immigrants), sold everything, bought a one-way ticket to Silicon Valley. Applied to Y Combinator seven times — rejected six times. Got in on the seventh try with SwipeGood. It didn't last. He pivoted to Elastic Sales (outsourced SDR teams for startups) and his engineers built an internal CRM because every tool on the market was designed for managers who want dashboards, not reps who need to make calls. Other salespeople saw it, asked to buy it. Close.io launched January 2013. Bootstrapped. $50M+ revenue.

### Lego 1 — Topic
Close's accidental origin. The CRM built by salespeople because every existing CRM was built for managers.

### Lego 2 — Angle (Carter's Lens)
The young SDR who admires the persistence story. Efti didn't have a tech background, connections, or a safety net. He had hustle and the insight that comes from doing the actual selling — not managing the sellers. The tool he built is the one Carter's audience wishes they had (or already uses). This is the story of someone who lived the SDR life and fixed the tools from inside.

### Lego 3 — Hook Architecture
See HOOK OPTIONS below.

### Lego 4 — Story Structure
1. **Setup:** Seven YC rejections over five years. Persistence.
2. **Acceptance + Failure:** Eighth try works (SwipeGood). It dies in 8 months.
3. **The Backstory:** Greek immigrant, one-way ticket, no connections, no safety net
4. **The Pivot:** Elastic Sales — outsourced SDR team. Business works. Tools don't.
5. **The Insight:** CRMs built for managers (dashboards, forecasts), not reps (calls, emails, follow-ups)
6. **The Accident:** Engineers build internal tool. Other salespeople ask to buy it.
7. **Payoff:** Close.io. 100% bootstrapped. $50M+. Zero VC.
8. **Closer:** The guy rejected seven times built the CRM salespeople actually want.

### Lego 5 — Psychological Triggers
1. **Underdog** — Greek immigrant, one-way ticket, 7 rejections, no safety net. The anti-pedigree founder.
2. **Vindication** — Built the tool that proves salespeople know what salespeople need better than product managers do.
3. **Conspiracy/Hidden Truth** — CRMs are designed for the wrong user. Everyone in sales knows this but nobody fixes it.

## HOOK OPTIONS

### HOOK A (Recommended) — Reader-First (SDR Perspective)

```
If you sell for a living, you already know this.

Your CRM was built for your manager.

Steli Efti knew that too. So he built one for the rest of us.
```

**Why this works:** Opens from the READER's perspective — Carter's voice starts with "you," not with a founder's name. "Your CRM was built for your manager" is a claim every SDR has felt but never articulated. "The rest of us" positions Carter and the reader on the same side. See-more test: "If you sell for a living, you already know this." shows before fold — it self-selects SDRs/AEs instantly and creates curiosity (know WHAT?). This is Carter's "explain, don't impress" voice — he's sharing a discovery, not narrating a biography.

### HOOK B — Magician (Outcome-Led)

```
A $50 million CRM started as an internal tool nobody was supposed to see.

An outsourced SDR team built it because every CRM on the market was garbage for the people making calls.
```

**Why this works:** "$50M internal tool" is an arresting claim. "Garbage for the people making calls" speaks directly to SDRs. But lacks the emotional pull of the rejection arc.

### HOOK C — Contrarian

```
Every CRM on the market was built for sales managers.

Dashboards. Forecasts. Reports. Everything except making calls.

One SDR team decided to build their own.
```

**Why this works:** Directly calls out the CRM industry. SDRs who read this feel seen — they ARE the people stuck with manager-facing tools. "Decided to build their own" is the curiosity trigger. Risk: "One SDR team" is less specific than naming Efti directly.

## VISUAL FORMAT

### Option A (Recommended) — Number Hero
- **Card type:** Number Hero (Typographic)
- **Format:** SQUARE 1:1 (1080×1080)
- **Asset tags:** [TYPE][LOGO][DATA]
- **Dominant element:** "7" in massive type (~250px+), IBM Plex Sans 600, white on dark
- **Subtext:** "YC rejections before building a $50M CRM" in 44px body text, #F4F4F4
- **Background:** Dark (#161616)
- **Logo:** Close logo, bottom-right, 96px, monochrome white
- **Image-hook loop:** The number 7 stops the thumb — it's too specific to ignore, too large to scroll past → hook reveals Steli's full arc (Greece → rejections → outsourced SDR team → accidental product) → second look at 7: it's not failure, it's the cost of persistence that built a category-defining CRM

### Option B — Quote Portrait
- **Card type:** Quote Portrait (Person/Founder)
- **Format:** PORTRAIT 4:5 (1080×1350)
- **Asset tags:** [PHOTO][LOGO][TYPE]
- **Dominant element:** Steli Efti photo (if available, otherwise Close logo large with quote)
- **Quote overlay:** "Every CRM on the market is garbage." in IBM Plex Sans 600, 52px
- **Key metrics below quote:** "$50M+ revenue · Zero VC · 100% bootstrapped" in 40px
- **Background:** Dark (#161616), quote in white, metrics in #0043CE
- **Logo:** Close, bottom-right, 96px, monochrome
- **Image-hook loop:** Steli's face + the provocative quote creates instant reaction (agree or argue) → hook reveals this isn't arrogance — it's a salesperson who tried every CRM while doing the actual selling → second look at "garbage": you realize he's right, and he built the fix

### Option C — Before/After
- **Card type:** Before/After (Infographic)
- **Format:** PORTRAIT 4:5 (1080×1350)
- **Asset tags:** [TYPE][LOGO][SVG]
- **Left panel (#161616 bg, white text):** "CRMs for Managers" (header, 52px) / "Dashboards" / "Forecasts" / "Pipeline reports" / "Manual data entry" (list, 40px each, faded gray)
- **Right panel (#0043CE bg, white text):** "Close" (header, 52px, Close logo beside it) / "Built-in calling" / "Auto email tracking" / "Automatic logging" / "$50M+ bootstrapped" (list, 40px each, bright white)
- **Image-hook loop:** The split shows two CRM philosophies side by side → hook reveals Close was the accidental product of an SDR team that lived on the wrong side → second look: you check which side YOUR CRM is on

## FULL POST (as published)

If you sell for a living, you already know this.

Your CRM was built for your manager:

Dashboards
Forecasts
Pipeline reports

Everything it does well is designed for the person reviewing your numbers, not the person making 80 calls a day.

The guy who fixed that didn't start in tech.

Steli Efti grew up in Germany, son of Greek immigrants.
His mother worked the factory floor. He sold everything he owned, bought a one-way ticket to Silicon Valley, and applied to Y Combinator.

Rejected.

He applied again.
Rejected again.

Six times over five years. On the seventh try, they finally let him in.
But that startup didn't make it either.

So he went back to what he knew. Selling.
He built Elastic Sales, an outsourced SDR team in San Francisco.
Cold calls, every single day.

And every single day, his team fought the CRM. Logging calls took longer than making them.

So his engineers built something for themselves. Calling, emailing, follow-ups, all logged automatically. Zero data entry.

They never planned to sell it.

Then other salespeople saw it during client calls and asked: "How do we buy this?"

Close.io launched January 2013. Bootstrapped and Still independent.

Over $50 million in revenue from a tool nobody was supposed to see.

The best CRM for salespeople came from a guy who got rejected six times, watched his startup die, and kept selling anyway.

Like the rest of us.

## POST QUALITY REVIEW

### 1. Connectors
- "The guy who fixed that didn't start in tech." — earned bridge from CRM pain to Steli's origin. Micro-loop: who is he?
- "Rejected. He applied again. Rejected again." — SHOWS persistence through rhythm. The repetition IS the feeling of the grind. Not told ("he was persistent"); shown through the pattern of rejection and return.
- "That startup didn't make it either." — standalone gut punch. "either" is the key word — it connects to the rejection pattern. Even the thing he finally got INTO failed. Accumulation of loss.
- "And every single day, his team fought the CRM." — temporal bridge from selling to tool pain. "And every single day" mirrors "Cold calls, every single day" — same rhythm, different pain.
- "So he went back" / "So his engineers built" — two causal THEREFORE connectors.
- "They never planned to sell it." — tension builder. Setup for accidental product reveal.
- No generic connectors.

### 2. Repetition
- "sell/selling/salespeople" thread: reader (sells for a living) → Steli (went back to selling) → product (for salespeople) → closer (kept selling). The word IS the story.
- "every single day" appears twice — once for cold calls, once for CRM pain. Mirrors. Different pains, same grind.
- Closer ADVANCES — unifies rejection + failure + persistence into one sentence.

### 3. Logical Jumps
- Reader's CRM pain → "the guy who fixed that" bridge → Germany, Greek immigrants → sold everything, one-way ticket (MOMENTUM: sold → bought → applied) → Rejected. Again. Again. (SHOWN, not summarized) → finally let in → BUT "didn't make it either" (gut punch) → THEREFORE went back to selling → cold calls every day → AND every day the CRM fought back → THEREFORE engineers built their own → "never planned to sell it" → BUT others saw it → "How do we buy this?" (MICRO-DIALOGUE) → Close.io → "from a tool nobody was supposed to see" (JUXTAPOSITION: $50M from an accident) → closer unifies all threads → "Like the rest of us" (IDENTIFICATION)
- Key moves: "Rejected. Applied again. Rejected again." = showing not telling. "That startup didn't make it either." = "either" as emotional accumulation. "And every single day" = temporal mirror. "$50M from a tool nobody was supposed to see" = juxtaposition connecting revenue to accidental origin.

### 4. Structure
- "Rejected. He applied again. Rejected again." — staccato rhythm that SHOWS persistence. Short fragments after flowing biographical sentence.
- "That startup didn't make it either." — standalone, 7 words. Gut punch after the triumph of being accepted.
- "And every single day, his team fought the CRM." — temporal bridge.
- "Logging calls took longer than making them." — concrete SHOWING. SDR-specific.
- "Over $50 million in revenue from a tool nobody was supposed to see." — juxtaposition in one sentence.
- Closer split: long building sentence + "Like the rest of us." — the break forces a stop before the punchline.
- Reads clean on mobile. No paragraph exceeds 3 lines.

### 5. Slop Check
- Zero em dashes
- Zero "Not X. Y." patterns
- Zero colon staging
- Zero arrow/emoji bullets
- Zero "Here's the thing" / "Let that sink in" / "Here's why it matters"
- Zero LinkedIn templates
- "Like the rest of us." — Carter identifying with Steli AND the reader. Not a mirror close.

### Word Count: ~210
### Hook Type: Reader-First (SDR Pain → Outsider Origin → Persistence → Accidental Product → Identification)
### Tone: Fellow SDR sharing a discovery. "You already know this" validates the reader (peer-level, not lecturing). The rejection arc is SHOWN through rhythm ("Rejected. He applied again. Rejected again.") not summarized. "That startup didn't make it either" is the gut punch — "either" carries the weight of accumulated loss. "And every single day, his team fought the CRM" mirrors the cold-calls rhythm, connecting two pains. The outcome connects back to the accident: "$50M from a tool nobody was supposed to see." Closer ties rejection + failure + persistence into one sentence, then "Like the rest of us" makes Carter and the reader co-owners of the story.
### EgoBait Score: VERY HIGH
- Close employees see their origin celebrated — "Bootstrapped. Still independent." is a badge of honor
- "They never planned to sell it" makes the accidental origin feel AUTHENTIC
- Rejection arc is the emotional engine — the RHYTHM of "Rejected. Applied again." makes everyone who's been told "no" feel it
- "That startup didn't make it either" — the word "either" is the screenshot moment
- "How do we buy this?" — micro-dialogue proves organic demand
- "Logging calls took longer than making them" — every SDR feels SEEN
- "$50M from a tool nobody was supposed to see" — the juxtaposition is shareable
- Closer: "kept selling anyway. Like the rest of us." — THIS is the screenshot line

# CARTER — What Buyers Actually Care About (AI???)
## Angle: The young commercial shares what enterprise buyers actually ask in demos. None of it is about AI.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Enterprise AI buyers don't care about AI itself. They care about data, integration, and provable ROI. |
| Angle | Carter (young commercial) shares what he hears in every demo: nobody asks "is it AI?" They ask about data security, stack integration, and proof. |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
I'm in enterprise demos every week.

Nobody asks if we use AI.

They ask three questions. And two of them have nothing to do with technology.

### HOOK B
$37 billion went into enterprise AI last year.

74% of companies can't show any value from it.

I sit across from those buyers every week. I know exactly why.

### HOOK C
Every software company added "AI-powered" to their website in 2025.

62% of enterprise buyers still needed the vendor to explain what the AI actually does.

That gap is where deals die.

### FULL POST (as published)

In enterprise demos nobody asks if we use AI

They ask three questions:

And two of them have nothing to do with technology.

$37 billion went into enterprise AI last year
74% of companies can't show tangible value from it
The average failed GenAI initiative burned $1.9 million

I think I see why:

Vendors walk in with "AI-powered" slides. Buyers sit there waiting to ask something else entirely.

Question 1: "What happens to our data?"

Security and data privacy now rival accuracy as the #1 buying criterion. Menlo Ventures surveyed 495 enterprise decision-makers. If your RFP doesn't address data residency and zero-retention policies, you're not making the shortlist.

Question 2: "Does it work with what we already run?"

62% of enterprise leaders say data access and integration is their top obstacle to AI adoption. Only 9% say all their data is actually available for AI initiatives. The model doesn't matter if it can't reach the data.

Question 3: "Can you prove ROI in X days?"

30% of buyers ranked measurable value as their #1 selection criterion. Price was 1%. They don't want cheaper. They want proof it works before they sign.

Three questions. Zero about artificial intelligence.

If you're evaluating enterprise tools right now, ask your vendor those three questions.

The answers will tell you everything.

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS
1. Scorecard image: Two columns "What vendors pitch" vs. "What buyers ask" - clean, minimal
2. Notes-app screenshot style: The three questions on plain background, like a real demo note
3. Quote card: "Three questions. Zero about artificial intelligence." on dark background

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Carter-isms: "I'm in demos", reader perspective ("If you're evaluating"), Q&A breakdown. No jargon, no pretending to be a CTO. Specific numbers throughout.
- **Idea Legos**: Teacher hook + Problem → Wrong Approach → Lesson → Solution confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (demos, nobody asks about AI) → Market context ($37B, 74% gap) → Personal observation (I think I see why) → Three questions with ascending value (security → integration → ROI) → Callback (zero about AI) → CTA (ask your vendor)
- **Psychological triggers**: Validation (buyers are right to ignore AI hype) + Tribal Identity (for people evaluating enterprise tools)
- **Ego bait**: N/A
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: enterprise AI buying criteria. Single question: "What do buyers actually ask?" 3-step: Context Lean "In enterprise demos" → Scroll Stop "nobody asks if we use AI" → Snap Back "They ask three questions. And two of them have nothing to do with technology." "See more" char count: ~60. Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **Traffic driver**: enterprise AI, buyer behavior, demos, AI-powered, data integration
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes, no "Here's" constructions, no slop patterns detected. Natural punctuation throughout.
- **Word count**: ~230 (published version trimmed from ~265 draft)
- **Edits from draft to published**:
  - Hook condensed to single line: "In enterprise demos nobody asks if we use AI"
  - Stats reformatted as three separate lines, source citations (BCG, 2024) and (Gartner) removed from body
  - "I've been in these rooms. I see why." → "I think I see why:"
  - "30 days" → "X days" in Question 3
  - Stacksync product bridge removed ("I stopped leading with AI-powered..." paragraph)
  - "DMs are open" CTA removed
  - Closing split into two lines for emphasis

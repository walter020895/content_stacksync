## CARTER — If you sell for a living, you already know this

### RUBEN

**Option A — Founder's angle**
> "Built for the manager. Not the rep. That's also why most CRM adoption data is terrible — the people required to fill it in are the ones it helps least."

**Option B — Dry and specific**
> "'Logging calls took longer than making them.' That's the line. Every sales tool dies or survives on that single equation."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Bootstrapped and still independent. That's what happens when the product solves a real problem for real people."

### BRITTANY

**Option A — Warm and observational**
> "And y'all — 'like the rest of us' at the end. That's the whole post in four words. He didn't close with the $50M. He closed with the identification. That's the right call."

**Option B — Ops lens**
> "Six rejections and a startup that died. And he kept going. That part never gets old. The people who build something real almost always have a version of this story."

**Option C — Simple**
> "Logging calls took longer than making them. I feel this from the operations side too. When the tools cost more than they save, the team always finds a way around them."

---

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Technical conviction**
> "They built it for themselves. That's the only origin story that produces tools that actually work. Somebody lived the pain long enough to know exactly what to fix."

**Option B — Builder's read**
> "Zero data entry. That's the entire product insight. Everything else — features, pricing, integrations — is downstream of that one decision. The architecture followed the rep's workflow, not the manager's."

**Option C — Provocative**
> "'How do we buy this?' That question showing up unsolicited during a client call is the only product-market fit signal that actually means something. Everything else is a survey."

---

### NACHO

**Option A — GTM conviction**
> "Seven tries. One startup that died. Then the product nobody was supposed to see. That's not persistence as a personality trait. That's someone who refused to stop until the problem was solved."

**Option B — Sharp operator**
> "CRM built for the manager, not the rep. That's also why CRM data is garbage everywhere. The people entering the data have no reason to. Fix the incentive."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Like the rest of us. That's the closer. Correct."

## BRITTANY — Microsoft. Google. Salesforce.

### RUBEN

**Option A — Business mechanics**
> "The subscription bet. When Hood made that call, Microsoft's entire commercial model ran on perpetual licenses. Calling that transition in 2014 is worth more than most companies' entire market cap. Nobody made her the story."

**Option B — Dry and specific**
> "First earnings call, $60 billion in one day. Ruth Porat walked in and immediately proved the hire. Still not the one on the cover."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Three names most people can't place. Three companies everyone uses. That gap is the whole point."

---

### NACHO

**Option A — Sharp operator**
> "CFO is the hardest seat in tech. Every number, every quarter, every acquisition is yours. When it goes wrong, you take the call. When it goes right, the CEO does the press tour."

**Option B — High conviction**
> "12 years in the boardroom before anyone called her name. That's not patience. That's being exactly right, consistently, in the room where it mattered."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Ruth Vader. Correct nickname. Wrong amount of coverage."

---

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Builder/architecture lens**
> "Moving a company that size from one-time licenses to subscriptions — the financial architecture of that is a multi-year build. Hood called it when the entire revenue model said don't. The engineers got credit for Office 365. She built the structure that made it viable."

**Option B — Pattern recognition**
> "Three different companies. Three women running finance and operations. All invisible until someone actually looked. The pattern is the same every time."

**Option C — Specific and sharp**
> "She rebuilt the model that moved Microsoft to subscriptions. Nobody put her name on that. This post did."

---

### CARTER

**Option A — Field recognition**
> "Sales gets the stage. The CFO made sure we could afford the stage. I think about this more than I probably should."

**Option B — Honest learner**
> "I knew Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce. I didn't know any of these three names. I do now. That's what this post does."

**Option C — Specific reaction**
> "Twelve years in the boardroom before Benioff chose her. That's not waiting. That's building the case every single quarter until there's no other answer."

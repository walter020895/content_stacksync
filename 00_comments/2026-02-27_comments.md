### RUBEN

**Option A — Founder's angle**
> "Built for the manager. Not the rep. That's also why most CRM adoption data is terrible — the people required to fill it in are the ones it helps least."

**Option B — Dry and specific**
> "'Logging calls took longer than making them.' That's the line. Every sales tool dies or survives on that single equation."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Bootstrapped and still independent. That's what happens when the product solves a real problem for real people."

### BRITTANY

**Option A — Warm and observational**
> "And y'all — 'like the rest of us' at the end. That's the whole post in four words. He didn't close with the $50M. He closed with the identification. That's the right call."

**Option B — Ops lens**
> "Six rejections and a startup that died. And he kept going. That part never gets old. The people who build something real almost always have a version of this story."

**Option C — Simple**
> "Logging calls took longer than making them. I feel this from the operations side too. When the tools cost more than they save, the team always finds a way around them."

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Technical conviction**
> "They built it for themselves. That's the only origin story that produces tools that actually work. Somebody lived the pain long enough to know exactly what to fix."

**Option B — Builder's read**
> "Zero data entry. That's the entire product insight. Everything else — features, pricing, integrations — is downstream of that one decision. The architecture followed the rep's workflow, not the manager's."

**Option C — Provocative**
> "'How do we buy this?' That question showing up unsolicited during a client call is the only product-market fit signal that actually means something. Everything else is a survey."

### NACHO

**Option A — GTM conviction**
> "Seven tries. One startup that died. Then the product nobody was supposed to see. That's not persistence as a personality trait. That's someone who refused to stop until the problem was solved."

**Option B — Sharp operator**
> "CRM built for the manager, not the rep. That's also why CRM data is garbage everywhere. The people entering the data have no reason to. Fix the incentive."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Like the rest of us. That's the closer. Correct."

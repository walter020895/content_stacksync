### RUBEN

**Option A — Confirms with a real detail (he was there)**
> Fifty people in that room. She organized it in six days. The alarm was real.

**Option B — Dry, brief, proud without performing it**
> We knew by week two. The vocabulary was never the test.

**Option C — Tease**
> Still sets the alarm. Old habit now.

### NACHO

**Option A — One line that goes one step further**
> The googling stops. The discipline doesn't.

**Option B — Reframes the principle**
> You made yourself ready before anyone asked if you were. That's the advantage.

**Option C — Simple, warm, and final**
> Good.

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Builder recognizing builder behavior**
> You didn't wait to be given the knowledge. You went and got it. That's all engineering is, by the way.

**Option B — Dry, slightly provocative**
> The 3am is the part most people skip. Also the part that matters.

**Option C — Unexpected warmth**
> Probably understands the product better than engineers who learned it in school. You know?

### CARTER

**Option A — Self-deprecating and honest**
> Still have a running doc of words I had to look up. Started it week one.

**Option B — Relatable one-liner**
> Four months in and I'm still googling things. Apparently this is the strategy.

**Option C — Simple, real**
> The alarm was the move. Everything after that was just showing up.

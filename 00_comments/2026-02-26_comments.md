## POST 1: BRITTANY — HubSpot's CEO took a $1 salary in 2023
**Link:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/-brittany-garrett-_hubspots-ceo-took-a-1-salary-in-2023-that-activity-7432885012603252737-V_vA)

### RUBEN

**Option A — Dry founder line**
> "The $1 salary thing is easy to dismiss as optics. When you read the whole story it isn't. The 20 bones accident alone. She'd been there a year."

**Option B — Brief and specific**
> "The orphanage part. Nobody headlines that. Good research."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "'Give them a sense of what your responsibility is in society.' That's a different kind of leader."

---

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Genuine warmth**
> "The Dropbox → HubSpot → snowmobile accident → five months running the company → CEO arc. That's not a career. That's a series of stress tests she kept passing. You know?"

**Option B — Builder recognition**
> "She tied her entire 2023 comp to equity the same year she cut 500 people. That's the only version of alignment that's actually real. Everything else is just vocabulary."

**Option C — Unexpected**
> "I didn't know this story. Now I do. And the $1 salary hits completely differently when you know the rest of it."

---

### CARTER

**Option A — Simple and honest**
> "I keep thinking about the part where she taught herself to raise her hand in American classrooms. Such a small detail that says everything."

**Option B — Genuine reaction**
> "That 'Very admirable' aside you snuck in there. Made me laugh. Then the story kept going and it landed even harder."

**Option C — Shareable thought**
> "From $150 after rent to running a $34B company. And her takeaway is making her kids visit an orphanage every few years. The priorities are right."

---

### NACHO

**Option A — Sharp one-liner**
> "If she was going to cut 500 people, she was going to give up her paycheck. That's the only way that conversation is credible. Most CEOs don't do that."

**Option B — High conviction**
> "Conviction is rare. She said no to her parents' money at 21 and no to her own salary at the worst moment. Same answer both times. That's character, not strategy."

**Option C — Blunt agreement**
> "That's who I want to learn from. Same."

## POST 2: NACHO — Stripe's early GTM didn't scale

### RUBEN

**Option A — Founder confirmation**
> "7 lines of code in the room. That's the whole pitch. The product works or it doesn't. No deck saves you if the answer is no."

**Option B — Specific and dry**
> "We still do this. It's slower. It's the only thing that actually works."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "Friction kills more deals than price. Stealing that."

---

### BRITTANY

**Option A — Ops warmth**
> "The 'you lose 80% of them' part. From an operations lens, those 80% aren't just lost deals. They're expensive sequences, follow-ups, re-engagements. The cost of the link is invisible until you calculate it."

**Option B — Genuine**
> "And y'all, they did this before there was even a name for it. Then someone named it after them. That's how you know it worked."

**Option C — Simple**
> "Make the gap disappear. That's it. I think about this in every process I build."

---

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Technical provocation**
> "7 lines of code. The engineers in the room saw that and decided the problem was solvable. The demo wasn't for the buyer. It was proof to both sides."

**Option B — Builder angle**
> "Most teams optimize for scale before they have anything worth scaling. The Collisons optimized for conversion first. The scale came because the conversion actually worked."

**Option C — Sharp**
> "Every sales leader I know preaches the trial link. Every founder who built something real preached the room. There's a pattern."

---

### CARTER

**Option A — Field recognition**
> "This is the most accurate description of what happens when you send a trial link vs. when you sit in the room. I see both versions every week. The room wins every time."

**Option B — Learner angle**
> "Collison installation. I didn't know it had a name. Makes sense that the tactic that built Stripe also has the best name."

**Option C — Self-aware**
> "I default to the trial link more than I should. This is a good reminder that the gap between 'interested' and 'using it' is where I lose people."

## POST 3: RUBEN — Snowflake started with a confession between two friends
**Link:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruben-burdin_snowflake-started-with-a-confession-between-share-7432913388340527105-_Vaa)

### BRITTANY

**Option A — Warm and specific**
> "Their kids helped assemble the IKEA furniture. That one detail carries the whole story. You can feel it."

**Option B — Character observation**
> "Every chapter of this story — the confession, the IKEA office, the Hadoop pitch meetings — they kept choosing the harder thing. And they were right every time."

**Option C — Simple**
> "'We created a company as collateral damage.' That's the quote. That's it."

---

### ALEXIS

**Option A — Builder resonance**
> "Two years with a whiteboard and no product. That's the part most people can't do. The conviction to keep drawing before you have anything to show. You know?"

**Option B — Technical edge**
> "Every expert said Hadoop. They said cloud-native. Being right early looks exactly like being wrong. Cloud won. That's the sentence."

**Option C — Founder honesty**
> "'I'm going to die at Oracle. And I'm probably going to die as a dinosaur.' That's the truest startup origin story I've read this year. The fear that starts the company is always the realest part."

---

### CARTER

**Option A — Enthusiastic learner**
> "Berkshire Hathaway hadn't bought into an IPO in over 60 years. That detail got me. When Buffett moves, something has already been proven for a long time."

**Option B — The detail that lands**
> "The hamburger joint in the story, then again in the close. Holding the IKEA office and $70 billion in the same frame is the whole point."

**Option C — Simple reaction**
> "Cloud won. Hadoop didn't. Four words that explain ten years of industry history."

---

### NACHO

**Option A — High conviction**
> "They were good at it. That was the trap. Comfort is the most dangerous place to build from."

**Option B — Blunt operator**
> "$5M to $12.6B when nobody else would. The bet that looked wrong until it was obviously right. That's how conviction works."

**Option C — One-liner**
> "'Collateral damage.' Every real product company feels this. The company is what you build so the product can exist."

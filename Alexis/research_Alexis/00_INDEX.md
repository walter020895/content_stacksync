## Alexis Voice Markers

From his profile - use these patterns:

- "I used to think X. I was wrong."
- Concrete examples (the iPhone, the Christmas dinner, specific tools)
- Teaching mode drops ("every 10 minutes, ask yourself...")
- Sharp on mediocrity, warm on purpose
- "Impact" not "results"
- "Movement" not "company"

## Anti-Slop Checklist

Before posting, verify NONE of these appear:

- [ ] "Here's why that matters"
- [ ] "Let that sink in"
- [ ] "That's when everything changed"
- [ ] "Not X. Y." (overused contrast)
- [ ] Em dash overload (—)
- [ ] Arrow bullets (→) except in data comparisons
- [ ] "Fundamentally" / "Ultimately" / "Seamlessly"
- [ ] "A masterclass in" / "A perfect example of"

┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐

├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Old way/pain    │ New way/outcome │

## Publishing Order (Recommended)

1. **Git - 4 Days** - Origin story, INSANE speed, most shareable
2. **Stripe - Seven Lines** - Clear contrast, every dev relates
3. **Docker - Works On My Machine** - Universal pain point
4. **GitHub - Social Coding** - Unexpected angle

Save `02_api_as_product.md` for follow-up if Stripe post performs.

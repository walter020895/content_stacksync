# Alexis Idea Legos Analysis

**Data Source:** 799 posts from 18 tech LinkedIn creators
**Outliers Analyzed:** 300 (top performers by outlier score)

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Hook Type Performance (What Actually Works)

| Hook Type | Usage | Avg Engagement | Insight |
|-----------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Fortune Teller** | 14% | **1,527** | HIGHEST performer - predictions win |
| **Magician** | 3% | **1,401** | Pattern interrupts work but underused |
| **Teacher** | 62% | 904 | Most common, solid baseline |
| **Experimenter** | 3% | 902 | Underused opportunity |
| **Contrarian** | 16% | 726 | Good for differentiation |
| **Investigator** | 2% | 336 | Lowest performer |

**Insight for Alexis:** Fortune Teller hooks (predictions, "this will change X") get **69% more engagement** than Teacher hooks, but everyone uses Teacher. Alexis should lean into predictions about tech/leadership trends.

### 2. Topic Performance

| Topic | Share | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| AI/ML/Coding Tools | 32% | Hot topic, saturated |
| Engineering Career | 23% | Promotions, growth |
| Engineering Leadership | 21% | **Alexis's sweet spot** |
| System Design | 6% | Technical credibility |
| Productivity | 5% | Practical value |

**Insight for Alexis:** Engineering Leadership is less saturated than AI takes. His "orchestration over inspiration" angle is unique.

---

### 3. Structure Performance

| Structure | Share | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| List Post | 56% | Dominant format |
| Observation/Opinion | 27% | Strong opinions work |
| Short Punch | 8% | Underused, high impact |
| Story | 5% | Personal stories |
| Question | 4% | Engagement drivers |

**Insight for Alexis:** List posts dominate but "Short Punch" (< 50 words, strong statement) is underused and high-impact. Good for his contrarian voice.

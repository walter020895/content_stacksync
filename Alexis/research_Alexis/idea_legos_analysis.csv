In reality, s","Many Engineering Managers often believe that quickly expanding their teams will lead to getting more things done.


❌ Wrong assumption.

In reality, scaling a team quickly often leads to more issues.

Before scaling your team, it's crucial to:

📋 Establish effective processes and document them: this will ensure smoother onboarding and alignment with the existing team dynamics.

🌟 Understand the Current Team's Capabilities: it's important to know what skills and strengths your current team has. This helps in understanding what new skills are needed in the team.

🤝 Ensure that the team is happy: hiring more people when there are team issues will increase friction.

🚀 Implement a well-structured onboarding process: when you hire new people, it's important to have a streamlined onboarding approach, or there will be a high risk of losing them immediately.

💼 Define Clear Roles and Responsibilities: before hiring, be clear about the roles and responsibilities the new team members will have. This helps avoid overlap and confusion.

❓ Verify the genuine need for additional team members: don't hire just to follow a hiring roadmap you defined at the beginning of the year.

Have I missed anything?

I've had the chance to lead initiatives like optimizing how fast pins load, revamping navigation, and now driving developer experience across 8 teams. Throughout all of this, my team has been an amazing support system, with incredibly talented people to learn from. 

I also want to give a special shout-out to my manager Vasanth Krishnamoorthy, tech lead and mentor Yen-Wei L. , and Director Mark Cerqueira. You've made this year really special and I appreciate you 🙏

It feels I get a peek into the future, and I get why Dario said 6 months ago that 90% of code will be written by AI.

This team works SO differently than any eng team I saw. A few examples:

1. The first code review is always done by Claude (second done by an engineer!)

2. Their test suite is almost 100% written by Claude Code

3. People no longer feel like a jerk by saying on a code review ""can you please write a test here"" as a result... so nothing goes in without a test. It's so trivial to do vs before.

I also think we might have misinterpreted Dario. He wasn't saying there will be no need for software engineers (at Anthropic, a HUGE need for them, and they are hiring!) 

But these devs work differently: faster, delegating 100% of trivial stuff to Claude, and iterating incredibly quickly, faster than I've seen devs do in the past.

I'll share more next week - I'm writing up what I learned for a deepdive in The Pragmatic Engineer with a lot more details (if you'd like to get it in your inbox when it's out on Tuesday, you can subscribe here: https://lnkd.in/grXSBkVw )

APIs have been the backbone of software-to-software communication for decades. Now, a new player — the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — is emerging as an AI-native protocol designed for agents, IDEs, and LLMs.

API (Application Programming Interface):

- Purpose: Enables software-to-software communication.
- Discovery: Requires documentation.
- Standardization: Varies — REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.

MCP (Model Context Protocol):

- Purpose: Enables AI-native communication between clients (agents, IDEs, LLMs) and servers.
- Discovery: Self-describing (no external docs needed).
- Standardization: One uniform protocol for resources, tools, and prompts.

Over to you: Do you think MCP will complement APIs or eventually replace them in AI-driven systems?

What do yo,"Your manager asks you to delegate more work to other engineers so you can scale yourself. What do you do?

Here's the simplest way to remember: think ","Your manager asks you to delegate more work to other engineers so you can scale yourself. What do you do?

Here's the simplest way to remember: think about each piece of work you delegate like a one-pager.

One-pagers include:
• Problem
• Goal
• Solution
• Alternatives
• Risks

Start at the top. Always tell them the problem (or the ""why""). Then, continue down the list as far as you'd like, but stop when you're confident the other person can handle the rest.

You can use engineering levels/titles as a rule of thumb, but it doesn't always need to map to that. For example,
• Staff engineer -> stop at ""Problem""
• Senior engineer -> stop at ""Goal""
• Mid-level engineer -> stop at ""Solution""
• Entry/Junior engineer -> cover most or all

When you want to challenge them, stop earlier. Let them take on more and give them that growth opportunity.

This framework covers what level of detail to provide, but of course, there's more to delegation than that. To get all the details, join 95k+ engineers and check my latest article: https://lnkd.in/ea-JjkKA",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancutler1_your-manager-asks-you-to-delegate-more-work-activity-7390795556945551360-BkJs?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFvytF8BltAXQnPxVJzCCgX_DFSIoOU-g00

Today I'm publishing an incredible piece by my friend Thiago Ghisi, who spent months researching and creating the most comprehensive framework for EM archetypes I've ever seen.

Most existing models focus on skills or job titles, but those break down quickly. Thiago's approach is different: he identifies *how* managers create leverage, not just what they do. All backed by decades of leadership + psychology research, and 50+ real-world EM case studies.

His model maps managers across two key dimensions:
↳ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘃𝘀 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 — do you optimize systems for steadiness or push them to evolve? 
↳ 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝘀 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 — do you scale through hard power (delivery) or soft power (culture)?

This creates four foundational archetypes:

↳ 🧰 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 (Stability + Execution) — the run-the-business managers. Excel at scaling processes, operational rigor, and predictable output.

↳ 🪴 𝗚𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲 (Stability + People) — the grow-the-humans managers. Focus on mentorship, psychological safety, and building strong culture.

↳ 🏁 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿 (Change + Execution) — the fast-delivery managers. Thrive on velocity, ambitious goals, and pushing technical/product boundaries.

↳ 🔋 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝘁 (Change + People) — the transformation managers. Excel at inspiring teams through vision, reorgs, and cultural shifts.

This would be already incredibly valuable by itself, but Thiago went the extra mile and, for each archetype, he identified both productive and failure patterns: a Driver can be an inspiring ""Finisher"" or a toxic ""Dictator."" A Guide can be a nurturing ""Mentor"" or an enabling ""Comforter.""

The practical applications are awesome:
↳ 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 — understand your “center of gravity” and blind spots. 
↳ 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 — when staffing your team, balance complementary styles instead of cloning yourself. 
↳ 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 — match archetypes to context (e.g. need a crisis manager? get a Driver)
↳ 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 — have precise language for leadership patterns

Thiago even includes AI prompts to help you identify your own archetype using performance reviews and peer feedback!

Of cou","Especially in the IT Engineering field, where competition is high, there's a common misconception that salary is the only factor that matters.

Of course, salary is important.

But it's rarely the main driver of retention. Otherwise, everyone would only apply for jobs at FAANG companies.

In reality, for the majority of us in this field, several other key factors make a difference.

💰 Salary: it's crucial and should align with your competencies, but it doesn't have to be the highest in the market.

📚 Learning: providing people with a learning budget to use throughout the year is highly appreciated.

📈 Personal Growth: opportunities for career advancement and skill development matter significantly.

🏛️ Culture: a positive work environment, loving what you do, and enjoying the company of your colleagues are some of the most important aspects.

🏋️‍♂️ Well-Being: mental and physical health has become a priority over the last decade. People value free time to spend with their families or for their hobbies.

Next time, before increasing your employees' salaries (which is fine), as a manager, ensure your team already has access to all of the above.

What other important retention elements have I missed?

♻️ PLEASE REPOST IF YOU FOUND IT USEFUL, IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

If you only need to push data from the server to the client, you might be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

While SignalR is a powerhouse for two-way communication, it can be heavy for simple ""server push"" scenarios.

Starting with ASPNET Core 10, we have a native, lightweight alternative: 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 (𝗦𝗦𝗘).

In my latest video, I walk you through the implementation of native SSE, which allows the server to communicate with the client on demand over a single, persistent HTTP connection.

And it took only a few minutes. Here's how 👇

My .NET version is defined in one place, a Build props file. I updated to net10 and that took care of all the projects in the solution.

The next part was updating the NuGet packages.

This was equally simple with central package management. I updated the version in the Packages props file, and it was picked up by all the projects in the solution.

Here's what's inside:
- Simple domain model with Domain Events pattern
- CQRS (no MediatR) + clean use cases implementation
- Validation and logging cross-cutting concerns
- Authentication with JWT and user context
- Boilerplate for RBAC authorization
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Minimal APIs, health checks

Which is why it’s so weird that I barely opened an IDE the last two weeks, even as I pushed lots of code. I use the CLI, the web and my phone (!!) to prompt code (with a Claude Code set up via the web integration - and now I can prompt code that pushes to prod via Claude Code’s mobile app + GH mobile to merge PRs)

When I just started out developing I remember being so so so full of ideas that I was coding in my head and wished I could have done programming while commuting / on the bus. With eg a phone. But it was impossible, ofc.

Now it’s not only possible - but I assume it will become increasingly the norm.

I feel we’re in the middle of the biggest dev tooling change happening across the industry - and it’s happening over a few short months. And rapidly spreading everywhere.

The next months and years we’ll be inventing  and experimenting with new and efficient ways of building software that will be completely normal for new grads entering the industry in a few years’ time…

Here are the top updates 👇

First, .NET 10 is an LTS (long-term support) release. So we get support for the next 3 years.

🔥 Performance improvements

Under the hood, .NET 10 delivers major performance boosts. The JIT compiler has been tuned with new optimizations such as de‑abstraction, smarter inlining heuristics and constant‑folding, allowing the runtime to do more work at compile‑time rather than at run‑time. There are many other optimizations across collections and LINQ, which translate to tangible speedups across everyday workloads.

🚀 Aspire goes polyglot

Formerly .NET Aspire, Aspire is now a polyglot, developer‑first platform for orchestrating front ends, APIs, containers and databases. Version 9.5 introduces a preview of a single‑file AppHost, letting you define and run your entire distributed application in a single file. The release also debuts a Generative AI visualizer to inspect and debug prompts and responses, plus expanded AI support with typed clients for GitHub Models and Azure AI Foundry and first‑class OpenAI integration.

🔗 EF Core’s new LeftJoin/RightJoin operators

LINQ’s lack of a built‑in outer join has long been a pain point. EF Core 10 fixes this by adding LeftJoin and RightJoin operators, so the code now reads exactly like the SQL you intend. For example, you can join products to reviews using LeftJoin() and EF will generate the correct LEFT JOIN statement under the hood. A corresponding RightJoin() keeps all rows from the right side while bringing in matches from the left. These new operators eliminate the verbose GroupJoin + DefaultIfEmpty pattern and make LINQ queries easier to read and maintain.

""Programming"" using English vs a prupose-made language will have the same difference.

It's perfectly possible to write a complex problem by describing what you want to do, to an LLM.

It will probably take 10-100x as much effort compared to a more constrained language with a bunch of rules, built for precise definitions (like a programming language!) Both to create, and especially to modify and maintain your software.

PS: to spell it out, the above is a metaphor. Hex numbers are precise ways to express something that is tricky to do with natural language.

You have to handle exceptions somehow.

IExceptionHandler implements the ""try-"" pattern.

You can decide which exceptions to handle.

To tell the middleware you handled the exception, you return true.

So, what makes this so interesting?

You can also chain multiple exception handlers that will run sequentially.

The first one to handle the exception successfully breaks the chain.

Here's how to use this in .NET 10: https://lnkd.in/e9k5yeJ3

It's a way to compose multiple exception handlers.

How do you approach global error handling?

Docker is a container platform that lets you package applications with their dependencies and run them on a single machine. Here’s how it works:

1. Starts with the app code and dependencies written into a Dockerfile.
2. The build image step creates a portable container image.
3. A container runtime runs the image directly on the host machine.
4. Networking connects containers and external services and produces the final running app.

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that manages containerized applications across a cluster of machines for scalability and resilience. Here’s how it works:

1. Starts with the app code and dependencies in a Dockerfile.
2. The build image is passed to a container runtime supported by Kubernetes.
3. A master node runs the API server, etcd (key-value store), controller manager, and scheduler to coordinate the cluster.
4. Worker nodes run the actual containers inside the Pods, managed by Kubelet and kube-proxy for networking.
5. Produces a running app that is distributed, scalable, and self-healing in nature.

Over to you: Have you used Docker or Kubernetes in your projects?

In case you're not familiar with the concept: MECE stands for 𝗠utually 𝗘xclusive and 𝗖ollectively 𝗘xhaustive. This means when you're breaking down a problem, the segments you choose don't overlap and cover every possibility.

𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄? When I asked candidates to solve a problem, many immediately jumped deep into the details.

✅ “There are generally 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 we can grow ads monetization: We can 𝗲𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝟭) grow engagement, 𝟮) show more ads, or 𝟯) increase CPMs. Based on the information you provided, CPMs seem harder to move, so I'll focus on  #1 and #2. Starting with engagement, we have 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: [...]”

🤔 As the interviewer, I have no way of knowing what the candidate is thinking. But if they show their reasoning like this, I can easily follow along.

There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all database anymore. Modern applications rely on multiple database types, from real-time analytics to vector search for AI. Knowing which type to use can make or break your system’s performance.

Relational: Traditional row-and-column databases, great for structured data and transactions.

Columnar: Optimized for analytics, storing data by columns for fast aggregations.

Key-Value: Stores data as simple key–value pairs, enabling fast lookups. 

In-memory: Stores data in RAM for ultra-low latency lookups, ideal for caching or session management.

Wide-Column: Handles massive amounts of semi-structured data across distributed nodes.

Time-series: Specialized for metrics, logs, and sensor data with time as a primary dimension.

Immutable Ledger: Ensures tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable transaction logs.

Graph: Models complex relationships, perfect for social networks and fraud detection

Document: Flexible JSON-like storage, great for modern apps with evolving schemas.

Geospatial: Manages location-aware data such as maps, routes, and spatial queries.

Text-search: Full-text indexing and search with ranking, filters, and analytics.

Blob: Stores unstructured objects like images, videos, and files.

Vector: Powers AI/ML apps by enabling similarity search across embeddings.

Over to you: Which database type do you think will grow fastest in the next 5 years?

In his landmark book High Output Management, Andy Grove introduced the idea of 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸-𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆, capturing an employee's readiness to shoulder responsibility.

Grove dissects TRM into several factors, but let's focus on the two key ones:

1) 🎓 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹/𝗙𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 — the employee's expertise and readiness for the task.
2) 📋 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 — how robust and well-documented your standards are.

Both items are crucial.

Say you need to create a design doc around a new product feature. You may have the best engineer in the world, who has done hundreds of them in their career, but they still need context from you:

✔️ 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸-𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 — what tradeoffs should they consider? What about speed and scale?

🔭 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 — what do design docs look like on our team? How do you plan rollouts and rollbacks? How is the code instrumented?

The right amount of management depends on the level of TRM:

1) 🔴 𝗟𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗥𝗠 — your team hasn't done this before, and there's no existing procedure. Provide detailed instructions, pair regularly, and maintain a close feedback loop. Don't let them work too long without your input; correct often and update the procedure with your feedback.

2) 🟡 𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘂𝗺 𝗧𝗥𝗠 — your teammate has completed similar tasks before and knows what good look like, thanks to experience and/or good docs. Provide clear context about the goals, then allow them the freedom to execute.
Keep communication lines open to offer support as needed.

3) 🟢 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗧𝗥𝗠 — your teammate has completed plenty of similar tasks in the past, with good results. In this case, other than giving full autonomy, you can challenge them to improve the definition of good. What can we do better?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved over the years to meet the needs of modern applications, from simple text delivery to high-performance, real-time experiences.

Here is how HTTP has progressed:
- HTTP/0.9: Built to fetch simple HTML documents with a single GET request.
- HTTP/1.0: Added headers and status codes to support richer interactions, but every request still required a new connection.
- HTTP/1.1: Introduced persistent connections and more methods, making the web faster and more efficient for everyday browsing.
- HTTP/2: Solved performance bottlenecks with multiplexing, enabling multiple requests to share one connection.
- HTTP/3 (QUIC): Shifted to UDP with QUIC to reduce latency and improve reliability, especially for mobile and real-time apps.

Over to you: Are you already taking advantage of HTTP/3 in your projects?

My Finder kept freezing after it grew to 8GB in size. I had no idea why. Restarting did not help. Turning off Spotlight indexing didn't help.

So I turned to Claude Code... and ~10 iterations+30 minutes later it found the issue, and helped fix it. It ran diagnostics commands to map memory usage, scanned the filesystem, looked at the size of nested directories, experimented moving folders with large files from know indexing locations to see if helped then killed the process and monitored to see if it helped (it did not) and then got to this approach.

This kind of debugging - where an agent can execute commands, get their output, and change their next step after - simply did not exist before an AI agent like Claude Code (and similar ones)

It's a brand new capability... and if you can do this, what else can you do? Just food for thought how good these tools are getting, quickly!

(As context, I didn't ""let the LLM run wild, and one reason it took so long is I double checked each command before letting it run, and after a while allowed *read* commands to run without it asking me.

In software development, architecture plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and behavior of software systems. It provides a blueprint for system design, detailing how components interact with each other to deliver specific functionality. They also offer solutions to common problems, saving time and effort and leading to more robust and maintainable systems.

However, with the vast array of architectural styles and patterns available, it can take time to discern which approach best suits a particular project or system. Aims to shed light on these concepts, helping you make informed decisions in your architectural endeavors.

To help you navigate the vast landscape of architectural styles and patterns, there is a cheat sheet that encapsulates all. This cheat sheet is a handy reference guide that you can use to quickly recall the main characteristics of each architectural style and pattern.

But AI is flipping this ratio. We're writing less code by hand, but we still need to run and check stuff. So the terminal becomes more important.

Also, IDEs give you classic ""engineer context"" — file trees, text editor, syntax highlighting, etc, while CLI tools give you ""manager context""—what's the plan, what commands are running, what are the outputs. AI tools are good enough now that we probably need to default to manager mode, not engineer mode. It feels funny to say it, but: don’t micromanage AI!

You can easily measure the quality of a piece by the density of highlights you take. So here are a few of my own:

↳ ""I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster.""

↳ ""What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute.""

↳ ""For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target.""

↳ ""After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart.""

—

The main thesis here is that today profitability has become easier to reach, especially if you work in a space where there is already a market (you have competition), and no big investments are needed upfront.

Profitability is also a good north star that drives good behavior: focus on business value, don’t over hire, keep talking with customers, and so on.

I like how it feels like the tide is shifting a bit on this. With the (glaring) exception of glorious AI slop startups, it feels like there is a growing sub-culture of small to mid-size companies shipping top quality products, and creating good, sustainable culture in the process.

There is something beautiful about this “long-tail innovation”, and I hope to keep doing my small part in helping people who work on it 😊

After nearly two decades of dealing with unreadable GUIDs and painful merge conflicts, Visual Studio 2026 has introduced the new .slnx format. It’s clean, it’s XML-based, and it actually makes sense.

But that’s not the only upgrade.

In my latest video, I show you how I moved my entire solution from .NET 9 to .NET 10 in just a few minutes.

The secret isn't upgrading every project manually, it’s using a ""Smart Setup"" with Directory.Build.props and Central Package Management.

In this video, I break down:

- How to change target frameworks for 20+ projects instantly
- Managing NuGet versions in one single file
- A deep dive into the new .slnx format (and how to migrate)
- Handling Dockerfile updates for .NET 10

Stop fighting with your solution files.

Don't answer the questio","After landing a $350k offer in big tech, my friend quoted this interview tip as what helped him the most in landing the job.

Don't answer the question. Answer the question BEHIND the question.

Here's an example:

• Interviewer asks... ""Tell me about your biggest failure""
• You respond by telling them about a big project that didn't ship on time and everyone moved on. That feels like a failure, right?

The problem is, the question behind the question was, ""How well do you learn from your big failures?"" So you can still tell the story about your biggest failure, but you need to touch on what you learned from it! Every answer you give uncovers more to the interviewer about how you are to work with (the pie below).

Here are some more examples:
• Biggest disagreement -> Can you work with others? (not a chance to brag about swapping teams due to arguments)
• A project you are proud of -> How large is your scope and do you approach projects methodically?
• A time when you missed a deadline -> Do you let others know ahead of time when your estimate is off? How do you approach your relationship with stakeholders?

Each question has something underlying the interviewer is trying to get at.

Figure out what it is. Answer THAT question and you'll see the offers start coming in.

--
The thing is, this framework isn't just useful for interviews. You can use it when you're fielding questions during a presentation, or when you're dealing with hard questions from your manager on why something hasn't shipped.

When you open a website, the difference between HTTP and HTTPS decides whether your data travels safely or in plain sight. Here’s what actually happens under the hood:

HTTP:
- Sends data in plain text, anyone on the network can intercept it.
- The client and server perform a simple TCP handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
- Fast but completely insecure. Passwords, tokens, and forms can all be read in transit.

HTTPS (SSL/TLS):
- Step 1: TCP Handshake: Standard connection setup.
- Step 2: Certificate Check: Client says hello. Server responds with hello and its SSL/TLS certificate. That certificate contains the server's public key and is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. 

Your browser verifies this certificate is legitimate, not expired, and actually belongs to the domain you're trying to reach. This proves you're talking to the real server, not some attacker pretending to be it.

- Step 3: Key Exchange: Here's where asymmetric encryption happens. The server has a public key and a private key. Client generates a session key, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it over. Only the server can decrypt this with its private key.

Both sides now have the same session key that nobody else could have intercepted. This becomes the symmetric encryption key for the rest of the session.

- Step 4: Data Transmission: Now every request and response gets encrypted with that session key using symmetric encryption.

Over to you: What’s your go-to tool for debugging TLS issues, openssl, curl -v, or something else?

We went through 17 issues, from massive backend performance wins, to this tiny one, on the image below. Can you see the issue that needed to be fixed?

It was both super casual... devs could really show *anything* that improves the quality or performance of Linear that they fixed. Most devs showed one or two small things. This off-by-one pixel was both found and fixed by Axel Niklasson Yun. Hawk eyes!

It felt like boom-boom-boom-boom. Small fix, neat fix, massive fix, usability fix. The next dev birefly showed what the problem was before, how it's fixed now, and a short summary of what they did, and how they measured it (for performance fixes like rendering times, or resource usage for backend improvements) 

There were some more involved parts, but no time wasted. For example, Kenneth Skovhus spent a few minutes showing how because styled-components *feels* slow, they tried out 3 other frameworks & measured how they compare for build time, JS bundle size, CSS size, and LCP rendering performance.  Based on this, they'll probably move off styled components... mainly for LCP rendering for massive pages to be faster. But it's all tradeoffs. (He actually wrote more about it here: https://lnkd.in/eYTc_m6i)

Or Maciek Pękala showed his fix where for  massive documents when you pressed Tab+F (to search) it took seconds for the search tab to appear because the DOM TreeWalker blocked the UI thread. He made a fix to make it yield, and there are no delays now.

Midway, unexpected (to me!) cofounder and CTO Tuomas Artman also showed his fix for the week. Love seeing hands-on founders, and this is definitely the case at Linear.

The full session was full of energy... pure joy! In the end, we overran by 8 minutes, truth be told, but it was so dense that I don't think anyone minded.

Linear definitely has a unique engineering culture. I previously did a deepdive on this in The Pragmatic Engineer which was paywalled - but now the paywall is removed. If you're interested in how they work, check it out: https://lnkd.in/eqxyrh4M

🚫 Over-Engineering.

Engineers often aim for perfection.

On one hand, this is good because it means they care and don't want to deliver crappy solutions. On the other hand, there's always the risk that they might focus on things that are not necessary from the beginning.

This is also why you want to foster a product-oriented mindset among your engineers.

🚀 When you have to launch a new product, you don't need to think about scaling it to 10 million users from the beginning, providing a 99.999% Uptime SLA, or building it on 20 microservices.

The first thing a product needs is validation, and you want it to happen sooner rather than later.

For this reason, it's important to:

🔥 Focus on delivering an MVP. This doesn't mean delivering low quality, but focusing on making the product ready for 100 or 1000 customers, not 10M.

♻️ Invest in a robust CI/CD system. This will facilitate faster iterations on the product, enabling you to improve the product and fix bugs more rapidly.

🏗️ Keep the architecture simple. While microservices are powerful for large teams and complex architectures (although not a strict rule), they are  also challenging to manage and coordinate.

🗣️ Involve your team in product discussions. This will help them understand why certain decisions are made and why perfection isn't expected right from the beginning.

What else?

Kafka and RabbitMQ both handle messages, but they solve fundamentally different problems. Understanding the difference matters when designing distributed systems.

Kafka is a distributed log. Producers append messages to partitions. Those messages stick around based on retention policy, not because someone consumed them. Consumers pull messages at their own pace using offsets. You can rewind, replay, reprocess everything. It is designed for high throughput event streaming where multiple consumers need the same data independently.

RabbitMQ is a message broker. Producers publish messages to exchanges. Those exchanges route to queues based on binding keys and patterns (direct, topic, fanout). Messages get pushed to consumers and then deleted once acknowledged. It is built for task distribution and traditional messaging workflows.

The common mistake is using Kafka like a queue or RabbitMQ like an event log. They're different tools built for different use cases.

Over to you:  If you had to explain when NOT to use Kafka, what would you say?

🚀 𝗔𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗛𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁𝘀.

One of the most important concepts in the book is the ""Plateau of Latent Potential,"" which, in simple terms, is the time that elapses between when we start doing something and when we actually see results.

We often expect this duration to be linear and assume that as soon as we start doing something, we should immediately see some small results. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way, and this mismatch can lead to disappointment, which often results in giving up.

The reality is that you usually begin to see progress just when you've passed a certain critical threshold, and then it becomes exponential.

🌀 Think about when you want to introduce a change in your team, even a small one, or when you want to learn something new. Instead of focusing on the results, be consistent in what you want to achieve, not just for days or weeks, but at least for a few months. Eventually, the results will come, and they will be exponential.

I'm impatient by nature, but this book literally changed my life and how I perceive change and progress.

> A bad & unclear decision (yet intentional) is better than no decision in 99% of cases.

This might seem extreme/unproductive, but isn’t.

Without a larger plan, there are some technical decisions you just can’t make decisively. 

—> Are you all aiming for Future State A or Future State B? 

Teams often hedge and avoid making the small decisions because they don’t know what the big ones will be.

Not making a decision might end up being worse than any of the decisions on the table would have been. 

This especially shows up with architectural decisions, where teams don’t commit to one approach or another, and end up trying to be flexible enough to support both.

It is better to make a ""bad & wrong decision"" today (and fail/revisit and improve later) than no decision today and tomorrow with the ""illusion"" that a perfect decision or solution will appear tomorrow.

In my experience, most projects fail or get delayed not because developers are slow, but because the analysis paralysis of over-engineering that slows down the decisions that the team, the department or the company has to make to move things forward even when they don’t have all the info.

And, in my experience, when you have an aggressive deadline or release target (as it was almost always the case for me and my teams in those high-performing/hyper-growth companies), you will never have all the info you need. Or, when you have that, it will be way too late.

Practice: 24-Hour Decision Making.

Promoting the idea that making a decision & iterating on it even when there is some disagreement is better for the team in the long-term than spending a lot of time trying to local optimize a decision with a lot of unproductive discussions.

Having a winner or a losser in a discussion/decision is less important to us than moving forward and iterating on things as a team and getting real feedback from users (it could be even internal/alpha users) from the production environment (it could be from the staging in some cases as well) after have gone full cycle (from requirements to deployment) and end-to-end (from database to UX).

My wife is a radiologist, which is one of the hottest spaces where AI is believed to make an impact, but she argued that AI is *never* going to save her time.

At first I thought she was nuts — but she had a great point instead.

She argued that even if they had *perfect* AI to create examination reports, they would obviously use it only to create *drafts*, to be later verified by doctors. And the thing is, verifying the draft of a report takes roughly the same time as doing it from scratch, because you have to go through all the examination data and images again to see if AI has missed something. 

So, unless at some point we decide to accept AI output as-is, without human verification—which seems highly unlikely—this is an inescapable problem. AI can help doctors create higher-quality work, but it will not save a lot of time.

This made me think that there are two classes of activities: the ones where verifying correctness takes significantly less time than doing the actual thing—let’s call them *verifiable*— and the ones where verification is comparable to the full execution—let’s call them *unverifiable*.

(not a big fan of these names, can you think of better alternatives?)

So, in software, coding is a verifiable activity: it’s (usually?!) way easier to verify correctness of software than writing it from scratch.

But code reviews, for example, are unverifiable: checking that an AI code review hasn’t missed anything requires you to go through the code yourself. Taking meeting notes is another obviously unverifiable task.

This is relevant because, for example, as AI makes us write faster code, we need to be able to review it just as fast to keep up with it — but AI code reviews are not going to save us significant time unless we accept them without verification, which means giving up some control over the code.

What does this mean for the future? I should write a conclusion but for now I don’t have any 🙂

Graphite - in my view! - is the best AI code review + stacked diffs + PR workflow product out there (disclaimer: I am [was?] an investor in Graphite - details here: https://lnkd.in/e98J2Bbu).

GitHub is already playing catchup to Cursor/Graphite: they will be adding stacked diffs in 2026, years after Graphite has polished this. 

And looking to the future: I am less and less confident that git will be the preferred way to store source code. Git doesn't support metadata like agent trajectories (that are increasingly important to attach to PRs), and was built to satisfy the workflow of Linux kernel development, and not working with AI agents.

1 - Load Balancing: Distributed incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single node is overwhelmed.
2 - Caching: Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce latency.
3 - Content Delivery Network (CDN): Stores static assets across geographically distributed edge servers so users download content from the nearest location.
4 - Message Queue: Decouples components by letting producers enqueue messages that consumers process asynchronously.
5 - Publish-Subscribe: Enables multiple consumers to receive messages from a topic.
6 - API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for client requests, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and protocol translation.
7 - Circuit Breaker: Monitors downstream service calls and stops attempts when failures exceed a threshold.
8 - Service Discovery: Automatically tracks available service instances so components can locate and communicate with each other dynamically.
9 - Sharding: Splits large datasets across multiple nodes based on a specific shard key.
10 - Rate Limiting: Controls the number of requests a client can make in a given time window to protect services from overload.
11 - Consistent Hashing: Distributes data across nodes in a way that minimizes reorganization when nodes join or leave.
12 - Auto Scaling: Automatically adds or removes compute resources based on defined metrics.

One of the biggest stories I have been hearing recently is that many engineering managers are","We, managers, are back to coding! Is this a good thing?

One of the biggest stories I have been hearing recently is that many engineering managers are back to coding, because of AI. 

AI is helping in two ways:

↳ 🧠 𝗜𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱 — managers often retain good taste for what good code looks like, but are a bit rusty on implementation details. AI makes the latter less relevant.

↳ 🗓️ 𝗜𝘁 𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘀 — by letting terminal agents run while people are on meetings or doing something else.

Is this a good thing? A reader told me ""Managers need to focus on the things that only they can do, rather than the things that anyone on their team can do.""

This is not wrong, but I also think many managers end up completely detached from how their team works, and spending some time coding can help *a lot*. 

The benefit here is not about throughput, but about empathy and staying in touch with what the DX and the whole process looks like.

This is most definitely good and I would love to see more of it.

Creating good software is hard and it's hard to explain to outsiders in a way they understand.

We have millions of non-technical ppl believe that they are equipped to create software that works as they imagined, using AI + vibe coding

...only to crash and burn.

They are now not outsiders, and might be open to understand why software is hard (and how they can get better)

As to why building good software is hard: where do I start?

Because:

- Good software solves a problem people/customers have

- Good software has users and customers

- Good software is not always good code, and good code is not always good software

- Craft and commercial viability are not always connected

- Tech debt is hard to appreciate from the outside, but you feel it every day in the inside

- After a while, code is the trivial part, and everything else (people, the business, politics etc) become the hard parts

... and many, many more things.

If you ever worked as a developer at any company on a software product, you get to learn so many things that are counter-intuitive from the ""outside.""

And don't forget that ""good software"" is very different for a startup looking for product-market fit, a scaleup that found it and needs to grow rapidly, or a stable and mature business that prioritizes keeping existing customers happy vs getting new ones.

Building good software has always been hard, but rewarding when you get it right.

Learn to create visuals.

I can't count how many people reach out to me every day to ask how I create these visuals.

They are always surprised when I tell them that I can barely hold a pencil in my hand, that I had no previous design experience, and that it takes me from 10-20 minutes to create one of these.

𝗦𝗼 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗜 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁?

🧠 I took a course from Janis Ozolinis that opened my mind (link in the comments).

✍️ I began practicing and publishing visuals from day one (even if they weren't great).

👀 I started following great visual designers and interacted with them.

🔁 I experimented a lot, changed things  (I created 15 versions of my own font).

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸?

📝 I use Figma and I collect all my ideas there.

🗂️ I have one page on Figma with all my visuals divided into 3 sections: Ideas, Drafts, Published.

💡 Every time I have an inspiration or I see something that could be transformed into a visual, I draw a sketch in the ""Ideas"" section.

🚸 Every morning, while walking back from taking my daughter to kindergarten, I start thinking about a visual and a post I want to publish.

🏠 Once at home, I create the visual; a simple visual usually takes between 10-20 minutes, while I create more complex visuals during the weekends.

🤖 Once it's done, I ask ChatGPT if the visual makes sense and the wording is correct (this to me is very helpful).

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼 𝗜 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲?

🎨 Visualizing your ideas helps make them easily understandable to everyone.

👁️‍🗨️ Visuals capture attention and so they are great for delivering quick ideas on social networks.

🌐 You can use visuals everywhere: in your documents, presentations, with your kids, etc.

📊 Visuals make complex content lighter and smoother to read (for me, it was very useful in my newsletter).

If you want to start creating visuals, these are some people I'd suggest you follow:

Janis Ozolins
Roberto Ferraro
Pejman Milani
Hannah Wilson
Ash Lamb
Michael J Boorman
Lee Sampson
Liz Fosslien

I also included what I think are my 10 best visuals. Name your favorite in the comments!

Team Lead:
- Normally has direct reports
- Facilitates team meetings
- Coaching, mentoring, and delegating work

I like to view this role as doing what’s best for the team -> If the team lacks technical seniority, you need to fill this gap, and if the team is drowning in tasks, you focus on better prioritization, stakeholder management, or help with finishing the tasks. It’s certainly a role for good generalists.

Tech Lead:
- Doesn't have direct reports
- Responsible for the technical implementation of the specific project
- Coaching, mentoring, planning, stakeholder management

I like to view this role as a good mix of technical and people-related skills, which includes: common sense and pragmatism, good communication and leadership, being a multiplier for others, and making everyone around them better.

To learn about all the differences between the lead roles, I have just sent out the newsletter to 179k+ engineering leaders called: ""Differences Between Lead Roles and How to Find Your Right Path"".

Read this to make sure it never happens to you.

I've told this story a couple of times before, but it's worth repeating.

I was in an interview some 7-8 years ago, doing a live coding exercise.

I was integrating with a currency conversion API and needed to add caching.

The problem was how this would scale with multiple concurrent requests.

A classic cache stampede problem.

I wanted to prevent this with locking.

Locking allows us to control how many threads can access some piece of code.

Note that I rarely worked with low-level code.

But the company I was interviewing for does.

Of course, they'd have this in the interview process.

Here's the situation:

- I knew I needed a locking mechanism
- But the method was async (oof!)
- So I tried to solve this using the `lock` statement

And that's where it all went to shit...

The `lock` statement doesn't work with async-await.

And it makes sense.

You can't guarantee which thread will complete the method.

So what's the solution?

You need to use an asynchronous synchronization primitive.

Luckily, C # has many to choose from.

Semaphore, SemaphoreSlim, Mutex, Monitor, etc.

Two important remarks:

1) Use a timeout when waiting on the semaphore
2) Always release the lock with a try-finally

Here's a tough question for you.

How would you implement a lock in a database?

Would you have nailed this interview?

A well-designed API feels invisible, it just works. Behind that simplicity lies a set of consistent design principles that make APIs predictable, secure, and scalable.

Here's what separates good APIs from terrible ones:

- Idempotency: GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE should be idempotent. Send the same request twice, get the same result. No unintended side effects. POST and PATCH are not idempotent. Each call creates a new resource or modifies the state differently.

Use idempotency keys stored in Redis or your database. Client sends the same key with retries, server recognizes it and returns the original response instead of processing again.

- Versioning

- Noun-based resource names: Resources should be nouns, not verbs. “/api/products”, not “/api/getProducts”.

- Security: Secure every endpoint with proper authentication. Bearer tokens (like JWTs) include a header, payload, and signature to validate requests. Always use HTTPS and verify tokens on every call.

- Pagination: When returning large datasets, use pagination parameters like “?limit=10&offset=20” to keep responses efficient and consistent.

Over to you: What’s the most common API design mistake you’ve seen, and how would you fix it?

This is ","One of the best staff-level engineers I worked with is on the market. Their job search is completely different than almost all job searches:

This is not someone who will fire off a single job application, or reply to any LinkedIn InMail or other message. He already has interviews scheduled with companies where several of his ex-teammates work, and heard that he is looking for his next job. Even if their company is not hiring or doesn't currently need the expertise he brings, they convinced leadership to create space for him.

What you need to know about this person: every team he's ever worked on, he did standout work, in every situation. He got stuff done with high quality, helped others, is not argumentative but is firm in holding up common sense and practicality, and is very curious and humble to top all of this off.

All of his peers liked him on his team. Whenever he worked with another team, engineers and engineering managers on that team got to like him. When we were in org-wide calibration sessions with around 100 people at his level, he was regularly in the ""top top"" bucket (reserved usually for 5% or less of the population) and did this without playing any time of ""political games"" or caring about influence. His manager was junior enough of a manager that they didn’t have the influence to ""push"" to get this kind out outcome: it was several more influential managers, aware of his work, who also concluded that his impact and attitude put him ahead of even their own team members (performance calibrations can be messy and political, I wrote about this at https://lnkd.in/eaavg4h6)

I hate the term ""10x engineer"" but this engineer is a role model for what a standout engineer is - in fact, some of my writing of standout engineers reference my interactions with folks like him (e.g. my article on the product-minded engineer, this one: https://lnkd.in/et7nWBgW)

And still, from the outside, this engineer is near completely invisible.

He has no social media footprint. His LinkedIn lists his companies he worked at, and nothing else: no technologies, no projects, nothing. His GitHub is empty for the last 5 years, and has perhaps a dozen commits throughout the last 10 (the below is screenshot of his actual GitHub profile).

The only people who know how good he is are those who worked with him (or worked with someone who worked with him.)

He still has to do the same interviews that everyone else does (because no decent company allows even the best hires to bypass the standard process), but thanks to his professional reputation built up inside companies, he is unlikely to have to do the job search that almost everyone has to go through. Well over a decade of standout work can lead here.

The quote came from Balint Orosz (my brother!) who got tired of seeing Adobe processes show up in Activity Monitor taking up memory and is using Claude Code a lot these days.

Genius!

(Adobe’s Creative Cloud software was made to be ‘sticky’ and extremely hard to remove: it keeps re-spawning itself if any Adobe product is installed and keeps and hogging resources, and there’s no simple way to uninstall it.

🔮 Estimates.

Estimating a project often leads to friction and frustration among teams.

Why?

🤝 Lack of collaboration: teams frequently work in silos rather than uniting to achieve a common objective.

🧠 Lack of knowledge: there is often no mutual understanding of each other’s fields.

🌐 Multiple teams involved: more teams involved = more complexity

🎯 Estimations are essentially guesses: even when some factors are known, they are still largely speculative.

However, while the practice of estimating projects depends on company and team culture, in some cases, estimates are crucial, especially when:

🎯 The product team needs to decide on priorities
👥 Multiple parties are involved
⏳ The project is time-sensitive

If you want to learn more about how to estimate projects effectively, I'll be sharing an article on the subject with my ~17K subscribers tomorrow.

But there's more.

To provide you with a well-rounded perspective, I’ve teamed up with my friend Jordan Cutler who will share his extensive experience as a Senior Software Developer and teacher at Maven.

This is ML engineer Menoua Kes","I didn't believe it until I saw it: but it *really* works in open offices! And you cannot even hear devs ""whispering.""

This is ML engineer Menoua Keshishian at Wispr Flow HQ, in SF, coding... by whispering to Cursor Agent using his mic (a BOYA Gooseneck that costs ~$70).

I was standing next to him and heard nothing. Everyone in the office does the same.

I have no affiliation with Wispr Flow (this post is not paid, I have no form of financial ties or other etc) - but saw devs like Arvid Kahl use it and swear by it. So I also gave it a go, and it slowly is growing on me for agentic coding (when more context for the agent is more helpful than less). The setup is super clever: you press and hold a usually rarey used button (the fn button on the Mac) and then Wispr ""listens"" and when you stop, it insers the *meaning* of what you said (not the exact transcript!). When you ramble and self-correct, it gets it right most of the time!

So when I was in SF, I stopped at their offices to say hi to the team and learn more.

CEO and cofounder Tanay Kothari told me that based on their data of 20K users anonymously analyzed, devs who use Wispr do 18% ""whispering"" (vs 82% typing) in month 1, and 72% ""whispering"" (vs 28% typing) in month 5, and it grows almost linearly until that point.

It's an interesting new trend, and AI agents are the reason it works.

I shared more details in a summary of my trip to SF, and interesting startups I met: https://lnkd.in/eGZscGXj

Update: in the comments, see notes on how whispering strains vocal cords as much as shouting - keep that in mind! My use case is I am alone in my room and talk with normal voice to the agent, similar to how James Stanier shared below. Perhaps this setup works better for those working remote / in a separate space?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gergelyorosz_i-didnt-believe-it-until-i-saw-it-but-it-activity-7389306027000774656-u0r8?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADw0mRYBSQhH_XZIMc99PusHGtWd6FiGizw

1. git checkout -

What does it do? It switches you to your previous branch. Instead of typing it all out, you can just say ""-"".

""git checkout jcutler-my-favorite-branch"" becomes ""git checkout -"". I even have an alias set up for git checkout so it becomes ""gco -""

AND you can extend this with ""git merge -"" to merge the last branch you were on, or ""cd -"" to switch to your previous directory.

2. git bisect

It's the most underrated debugging tool. When something that WAS working starts breaking, run ""git bisect start."" It will use binary search to figure out the exact commit that broke it in lg(n) tries. 

Because it uses binary search, it can find the bad commit across 1000+ commits in just 10 tries.

3. git checkout HEAD@{1.week.ago}

Or more generally, git checkout branchname@{timeframe}. You can use this to supercharge your git bisect skills. When you use ""git bisect"", you need to start by finding a ""good"" and ""bad"" commit. 

You can easily find the good commit by trying different times of the codebase with this trick.

I frequently receive these kinds of questions from ","Should You Stay Technical as an Engineering Manager? Should You Still Write Code or Be Hands-On?


I frequently receive these kinds of questions from other engineers or first-time EMs who are struggling with similar issues, and I believe the answer is a bit more complex than a simple yes or no like many tend to give.

First of all, a distinction has to be made between ""staying technical"" and ""being hands-on,"" which are often confused:

🛠️ Staying Technical: involves keeping up with technologies in your environment and understanding their workings.

🙌 Being Hands-On: involves directly engaging in technical activities like coding or system development.

While as you progress into leadership roles, we usually observe (with some exceptions) a notable decline in hands-on involvement, the need to stay technical remains constant and becomes crucial for an EM.

So, how do you stay technical?

🤝 Joining technical meetings to stay up-to-date and engaged with the team.

📝 Contributing to documentation to solidify understanding and assist the team.

🛠️ Building internal tools to maintain coding skills and create useful resources.

🎤 Presenting team projects to understand and simplify technical concepts.

These are just a few ways to stay technical.

I wrote about this and much more in my latest newsletter issue, which I'm honored to say was sponsored by CTO Craft Con London (an awesome conference about Technical Leadership).  

Inside the article you'll find a promo code, so you can get an additional 10% off your conference ticket👇

https://lnkd.in/dv3PYb3g

Since this is still a hot topic, I'd be really interested to hear feedback from other engineers and EMs.

1. They rank Amazon, GitLab, GCP, Windsurf all above Cursor. WTF?

In reality: companies I talk to (large and small) are choosing to go with Cursor, after careful evaluation. One example: Cloud Kitchens evaluated both Windsurf and Cursor; ditched Windsurf (and Devin!) and are going with Cursor. They detailed their evaluation: https://lnkd.in/eFnRfEZ6

I've yet to hear a single company choose Amazon Q or Kiro, or Gemni CLI or Juni over Cursor... and don't think that Amazon or ""Google Cloud"" have any Cursor alternatives (though Gemini CLI is promising, but miles behind Claude Code). Which brings me to my next WTF:

2. No mention of Claude Code or OpenAI Codex. WTF??

Really? For an August 2025 report? Claude Code took the industry by a storm, and OpenAI Codex is also picking up. (Safe to assume neither OpenAI nor Anthropic pay Gartner - a year ago, when Cursor was taking the industry by a storm, Gartner also ""forgot"" them off the list)

3. Conflict of interests in the report that Gartner does not disclose. WTF?

Cursor pays Gartner nothing to be in the report: but others do! Several companies mentioned in the report much more favorably than Cursor - with a product that is worse! - pay Gartner heavy money to talk to Garnter analysts and rank higher up on this chart. This starts at $50K/year, but the more you pay, the more you can ""influence"" analysts.

One company that definitely pays Gartner is GitLab: they can offer the report because you HAVE to pay Gartner to even share a report you can brag about. Which is what they do: https://lnkd.in/eXt6q-nd 

(Is it a coincidence that GitLab is also, conveiently ranked above Cursor? Or that Gartner doesn't mention which companies pay them, and which ones don't?)

The cherry on the top: to get access to the Garnter study, it will start at around $50K/year/seat. Yes, really!

Here's a free report on what tools software engineers *actually* use, where no vendors paid to be covered, in The Pragmatic Engineer: https://lnkd.in/eB-ziSYi

Frankly, Gartner is becoming embarrassing. Anyone making decisions based on their reports deserves to choose subpar products, to be fair.

(And for one more example on the analysis quality of The Pragmatic Engineer vs Gartner, check out this analysis from 2023 that went head-on-head with Gartner on cloud development environments, but covered a lot more alternatives, with none of them paying for coverage. I heard it's a lot more detailed than Gartner's $50K report: https://lnkd.in/ekmP49DX )",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gergelyorosz_gartner-has-been-out-of-touch-with-tech-analysis-activity-7374374378240786432-9WsQ?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFHqbAgBfu0OaxAJFn61NcjPFel2s48lksk

This Reddit thread claiming that a ""major food delivery app"" is pocketing priority fees and driver benefit fees blew up a few days ago: https://lnkd.in/eFG7M3Vr

It got the attention of journalist Casey Newton (at Platformer.) Casey reached out, and started chatting with this person over Signal. He asked for evidence of the claims, and got a photo of the UberEats badge of this ""whistleblower"" and a 14-page supposedly internal document uncovering damning things.

Except the badge is absolutely fake and AI-generated, as is the document! I know, because I worked at Uber, still meet with people who work at Uber and the badge has not changed, and looks nothing like the one on the photo. There is no ""UberEats"" badge; it is not green; the title is obviously not on the badge (if it was, a new badge would need to be issued on every promotion). (I would upload my own badge that I still have - but now I worry that doing so would make it easier for the next troll to create a more realistic badge, and eventually fool a less careful journalist!)

Casey figured out he is being baited and fed AI-generated documents, and confronted this poster: who then simply deleted their Signal account. A lot longer post by Casey with all the details, and the fake 14-page, AI-generated document: https://lnkd.in/euQGqV6e

The problem is how it took this baiter a few minutes to generate plausible sounding lies, but hours for a journalist to figure out it's all fake... and the lie keeps spreading online. As Casey put it so well:

""The rapid spread of the whistleblower’s post illustrated yet another maxim they taught us in J-school: A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on. With AI tools at their fingertips, hoaxsters can make those lies travel even faster.""

(All other claims were also false, as confirmed by Uber and DoorDash. If there was a whisper of truth in it, you can bet real whistleblowers would come out: there are thousands of people working at each company, and even more ex-employees who would say something if there was an ounce of truth in it...)",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gergelyorosz_an-anon-poster-pretended-to-be-an-ubereats-activity-7414248891782467584-dTxp?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC4jc3UBNDwi0iakJa7TE73D10HE7YvXxCo

In this week’s podcast episode I had the pleasure of speaking with Birgitta Boeckeler, distinguished engineer and global lead for AI-assisted software delivery at Thoughtworks.

Birgitta's full-time job is to figure out how engineering teams can make the most out of AI — and she shared some fantastic insights about what's working (and what's not) in real-world teams.

Here are a few takeaways from our chat:

↳ 🔄 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻-𝗶𝗻-𝘁𝗵𝗲-𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽 𝗶𝘀 𝗸𝗲𝘆 — small, incremental changes with constant review beat large autonomous agent workflows. Non-determinism is a feature, not a bug.

↳ 📊 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝘃𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗹𝘆 — from negative to 10x improvement, depending on tech stack, codebase quality, and team practices. And remember: if coding is only 30% of your work, you can't exceed 15-20% overall improvement.

↳ 🧠 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗸𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗺 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 — the best teams combine critical thinking about AI's limitations with ambitious experimentation. Both perspectives bring value and you should reward them.

↳ 🏗️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗜 — modular, well-structured code helps AI as much as it helps developers. Clean architecture still matters.

↳ 🎯 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 — evaluate probability, impact, and detectability for every AI-generated change. Your experience and ""scars from the past"" are still crucial.

↳ 🔧 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 — whether terminal-based like Claude Code or IDE-based like Cursor, successful tools integrate deeply with existing workflows.

A Technical Program Manager.

The funny thing is that until a couple of years ago, I barely knew what a TPM is 😅 

But now, I can't imagine our workflow without one. 

So, what's a TPM?

In simple terms, a Technical Program Manager is an individual responsible for overseeing multiple complex projects, covering everything from planning and execution to delivery.

Why did we need a TPM, and why might you need one too?

 📈 Increasing project complexity
🔄 Need for better cross-functional coordination 
🔗 Aligning multidisciplinary teams 
🛠️ Freeing engineers from project management tasks

Here are the benefits we've experienced in the short to medium term after hiring a TPM:

🎯 Clearer project objectives 
🌊 Smoother processes 
🧭 Strategic project alignment with organizational goals
⚠️ Proactive risk management 
📊 Resource optimization

Hiring a Technical Program Manager isn't an easy task. 

You often need someone with a ""T-Shaped"" profile: a generalist with substantial expertise in your specific field and excellent soft skills.

But don't worry, it's Thursday, and I've got all of this and much more covered in The Hybrid Hacker, my newsletter about Engineering, Leadership, and Career Growth, which is sent to 23.3K subscribers.

Understanding what is expected of each engineering level would have helped me make better decisions earlier in my career.

I put together this mega engineering levels cheatsheet from junior levels up to staff level. 

If you are an engineer, go through it and see if you are due for a promotion, or identify gaps and work towards the next level.

If you are a student, get a sense of what is expected of you as you progress in your career.

Note: These are general guidelines for the standard tech company, using Meta and Google as reference. There can and will be deviations/exceptions depending on company culture and priorities (e.g. some high level engineers still write a lot of code).

🔹 Smoke Testing 
This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks. 
 
🔹 Functional Testing 
This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results. 
 
🔹 Integration Testing 
This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested. 
 
🔹 Regression Testing 
This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn’t break the existing behaviors of APIs. 
 
🔹 Load Testing 
This tests applications’ performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application. 
 
🔹 Stress Testing 
We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally. 
 
🔹 Security Testing 
This tests the APIs against all possible external threats. 
 
🔹 UI Testing 
This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly. 
 
🔹 Fuzz Testing 
This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.

.
.
In system design, it is important to understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism. 

As Rob Pyke(one of the creators of GoLang) stated:“ Concurrency is about 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 lots of things at once. Parallelism is about 𝐝𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 lots of things at once."" This distinction emphasizes that concurrency is more about the 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 of a program, while parallelism is about the 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. 

Concurrency is about dealing with multiple things at once. It involves structuring a program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, where the tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, but not necessarily at the same instant. 

Concurrency is about the composition of independently executing processes and describes a program's ability to manage multiple tasks by making progress on them without necessarily completing one before it starts another.

Parallelism, on the other hand, refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple computations. It is the technique of running two or more tasks or computations at the same time, utilizing multiple processors or cores within a computer to perform several operations concurrently. Parallelism requires hardware with multiple processing units, and its primary goal is to increase the throughput and computational speed of a system.

In practical terms, concurrency enables a program to remain responsive to input, perform background tasks, and handle multiple operations in a seemingly simultaneous manner, even on a single-core processor. It's particularly useful in I/O-bound and high-latency operations where programs need to wait for external events, such as file, network, or user interactions.

Parallelism, with its ability to perform multiple operations at the same time, is crucial in CPU-bound tasks where computational speed and throughput are the bottlenecks. Applications that require heavy mathematical computations, data analysis, image processing, and real-time processing can significantly benefit from parallel execution.

He cares about technical exce,"I know an engineer who has been stuck in a mid-level role for 30+ years because he doesn’t care what his managers think. He cares about technical excellence. That is great, but it won’t get you promoted. 

Technical excellence alone does not get engineers promoted because technical excellence alone does not create business value.  To get promoted, especially at higher levels, an engineer needs to make it clear that they have an impact in at least one of these three things: 

1) Revenue Generation

This could mean they launch new features/products, facilitate payments, build systems to handle more customers, or a number of other things. However, the connection between the engineer’s work and the revenue or opportunity for revenue should be clear. 

2) Cost Reduction

On the other side of revenue is cost reduction. A business’s profits increase when its costs decrease, so doing any work that improves the efficiency of the business will be seen as valuable. 

3) Moat Construction

If an engineer’s work doesn’t have direct impact on profit but does help create a competitive advantage for the company, this will also be seen as incredibly valuable. 

The ways in which an engineer can influence each of these three things is practically unlimited, but the important thing for engineers to understand is that doing value-adding work will lead to promotion. Doing maintenance work (exclusively) leads to a maintenance position. 

This may be a very stable job, which is great if that is what you want. But it won’t be a fast-growing or far-reaching career. If you want one of those, you have to create growth for the company. 

I wrote an article for Jordan Cutler’s “High Growth Engineer” newsletter that goes through how you can become an engineer that drives impact and gets promoted to higher and higher roles. 

The insights come from my 25+ years as an engineering leader throughout my career, based directly on what has led me to promote scores of engineers. 

It includes the list of the 5 top traits in engineers that I promoted, as well as stories and examples of engineers creating outsized value.

❌ Before, he'd get a question like, ""Tell me ","This one communication shift took my friend from rejections to landing a senior 270k offer in big tech.

❌ Before, he'd get a question like, ""Tell me about how you made an impact on your team.""

And he'd answer like, ""Yeah, there was this one time... < speak for a minute on the story >... oh and there was this other time too... < another one >."" 

But the interviewer would already be lost by the end of the first one. They want someone senior, someone who can take a step back first.

I told him, you need to show your STRUCTURED thought process. Seniors speak in bullet points first, then details after.

✅ So he switched it to, ""Sure. When I'm making impact on the team, I like to think about 3 things--opportunity, effort, and risk. Each quarter, we map projects on these axes and one of the projects I proposed had high opportunity and medium effort/risk. Let me tell you more about that one, why I worked on it, and how I drove it forward...""

Once he switched to this, his interviewer's eyes started lighting up early on in his answer. He finally figured it out. Then, the offers followed.

So why is the second one better?
1. It shows you don't just jump into solutions.
2. It shows your decision criteria for action. You won't work on unimpactful work.
3. It gives your interviewer an overview first, almost like an ""agenda"" at the start of a presentation. They know what to expect.

Before you answer, take a step back, share your thought process, and show your structured thinking. Don't just dive in and start going off on stories.

This doesn't feel that it will lead to anything good - but the mix of the promise of riches and a sense of urgency about ""AGI"" and more startups doing it is making this work setup more popular.

If it was my first-ever job and I had no family and did not care for the health impact of poor sleep and overwork: sure, I'd do it. Today I see that this would be silly: the more I work without breaks, the worse my work gets.

Two possible explanations:

1. Big Tech software engineers might be less likely to change jobs than before. Perhaps because of the poor job market, or perhaps because it's harder to get comparable job offers.

2. A hiring slowdown across all of Big Tech. From a commenter on The Pragmatic Engineer:

""Previously, big tech average tenure hovered around 1.5-3 years, not because people were churning jobs that frequently, but because tech companies were hiring at an exponentially growing rate (+20-25% year over year) for so many years in a row. In such an environment, the vast majority of employees are actually new hires, and even when there is zero attrition, the average tenure would still be a very low 2-3 years.""

- Some pretty important features were vibe coded with Claude Code... like the rendering engine that translates Markdown to the UI (Claude returns Markdown!)

- Engineers, on average, merge 5 pull requests per day (this is high!!)

- The last year, the engineering team's size doubled at Anthropic. The PR throughput (PRs per engineer, per day) instead of going down or staying the same... went up by 67%! This was the same time when every dev inside Anthropic started to use Claude Code

- Mockups feel like a thing of the past when you can build 5-10 working prototypes per day. And this is what the team is doing - we go into a specific example with ~20 prototypes over 2 days.

Here's what Sulman Choudhry (Head of ChatGPT Engineering) told me: he and the team have been very pleasantly surprised by how the junior engineers they hire are basically ""super junior"" engineers, who end up teaching the rest of the team ways to use AI tools in new ways, oftentimes more efficiently (and are very fast learners - probably partially because of using AI as well!)

Below is an amusing story that highlights how this new generation thinks a lot more ""AI-native"" in how they solve problems... to the point that it surprises even experienced engineers.

The companies that have stopped hiring juniors could well be missing out on exactly this type of energy spreading!

Read more in this week's The Pragmatic Engineer deepdive here: https://lnkd.in/eGZscGXj

Update: my point with all this is not about OpenAI: it's that the whole ""companies should not hire juniors because of X or Y"" (which has been a recurring theme since 2020 to today) just probably don't make that much sense when you look at the bigger picture? A balanced team almost always works better. Companies like OpenAI can afford to only hire senior people (and did it for a long time!) and are learning the same.

Imagine being able to find security risks when you build your code.

Static code analysis lets you do this.

Here's an example build error that warns me my password hashing code is insecure. 👇

Static code analysis can help you write secure and consistent code. And you can also enforce this at build, even in CI pipelines.

Note that this doesn't detect every possible issue.

If you want to take this further, you can look at more powerful solutions like SonarQube.

If you are using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) in .NET, you have 5 built-in ways to distribute traffic. But which one should you choose?

Here is the breakdown:

1. RoundRobin: The classic. It cycles through servers evenly. Simple, but it assumes all servers are equally fast.

2. LeastRequests: The smart choice. It sends traffic to the server currently doing the least work.

3. Random: It picks a server at random. Surprisingly effective for high-volume, uniform workloads.

4. PowerOfTwoChoices: The balanced approach. It picks two random servers and chooses the one with fewer requests. It avoids the overhead of checking every server.

5. FirstAlphabetical: The ""sticky"" one. It always picks the first available server. Good for failover setups, bad for load distribution.

Most people stick with RoundRobin, but switching to LeastRequests can significantly improve tail latency in systems where request times vary.

I dive deeper into how to scale horizontally using YARP here: https://lnkd.in/daDNMpmB

Which strategy is your default choice?

Fortunately, .NET has you covered right out of the box.

Feature flags are a software development technique that allows you to wrap application features in a conditional statement.

You can then toggle the feature on or off at runtime to control which features are enabled.

.NET already has feature flag support built in.

You can use the IFeatureManager in your code to check whether a feature is enabled.

Want to learn more about using feature flags?

Check out this article: https://lnkd.in/ddxmMg4V

There are many popular services for managing feature flags.

I've used LaunchDarkly often, and recently also PostHog (it offers many more features).

🧠 Remembering what people say.

Remembering demonstrates not just that you've heard, but that you truly value the speaker's words.

As an Engineering Leader or Manager, this can make a huge difference and offers many benefits:

🤝 More than just Listening: it shows you really care about your team.

👥 Builds Connections: it's a way to show you've genuinely listened and remembered.

🔄 Keeps Conversations Going: makes it easier to reconnect with earlier discussions.

❤️ Builds Trust: when you remember, people feel valued and understood.

🚀 Gives You an Edge: in your job, remembering details can significantly impact your effectiveness.

If you're like me and sometimes struggle to remember everything, there's a simple solution.

Journaling.

Your API is slow. Users are complaining. And you have no idea where to start looking. Here is the systematic approach to track down what is killing your API.

Start with the network: High latency? Throw a CDN in front of your static assets. Large payloads? Compress your responses. These are quick wins that don't require touching code.

Check your backend code next: This is where most slowdowns hide. CPU-heavy operations should run in the background. Complicated business logic that needs simplification. Blocking synchronous calls that should be async. Profile it, find the hot paths, fix them.

Check the database: Missing indexes are the classic culprit. Also watch for N+1 queries, where you are hammering the database hundreds of times when one batch query would do.

Don't forget external APIs: That Stripe call, that Google Maps request, they are outside your control. Make parallel calls where you can. Set aggressive timeouts and retries so one slow third-party doesn't tank your whole response.

Finally, check your infrastructure: Maxed-out servers need auto-scaling. Connection pool limits need tuning. Sometimes the problem isn't your code at all, it’s that you are trying to serve 10,000 requests with resources built for 100.

The key is being methodical. Don't just throw solutions at the wall. Measure first, identify the actual bottleneck, then fix it.

Over to you: What is the weirdest performance issue you have tracked down?

CQRS is the simplest pattern out there.

First, there was CQS: Command Query Separation.

What does this mean? We split an object's methods into write (command) and read (query) methods.

CQRS is the evolution of CQS. CQRS works on the architectural level. At the same time, CQS works on the method (or class) level.

The CQRS pattern uses separate models for reading and updating data.

This separation can be logical OR physical.

My preferred approach is starting with logical CQRS.

One database + separate flows for writes and reads.

You can design a data model fine-tuned for each operation.

A lot of developers stay away from CQRS because they think it's complex.

The reality is you're probably already applying CQRS principles without knowing it.

Here's a simple implementation: https://lnkd.in/d-qUdpn3

What do you think about the CQRS pattern?

I use the Options pattern.

Here's why you should know about it.

App configuration lives in:

- Environment variables
- (appsettings) JSON files
- User secrets
- Other config providers

You can get individual values using the IConfiguration interface.

But this is error-prone and won't scale, so I don't recommend it.

Instead, I use the Options pattern:

- Create a class to represent the settings
- Bind the class properties to application settings (JSON)
- Consume the Options pattern in my code using IOption

You can also add data annotations to your settings class for simple validation.

Here's how you can implement the Options pattern in .NET: https://lnkd.in/gjVBDHqM

Do you know the difference between IOptions, IOptionsSnapshot and IOptionsMonitor?

It's called MECE.

Huh? mice? No. MECE 😂. It stands for ""Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive."" It forces your communication to be structured.

Let's take an incident investigation as an example. Many times, engineers are dropping messages in the channel like throwing darts.

❌ Before: ""It could be the landing page. No, that's not it. Maybe seasonality? Nope, that's not it either... anyone have other ideas?""

✅ After: ""If signups are down, it's either actually down or it's a false positive. If it's a false positive, we can check for seasonality or a data issue. If it's an actual drop, it could be that it's iOS only, android only, or both. Let's narrow it down.""

MECE tells you to come up with all the mutually exclusive and many options as possible upfront, then narrow down and cross out. 

This has a few benefits:
1. You can literally SEE the structure via a tree this gives your communication and thinking
2. Once you see it, you can delegate each of those to others working on the issue
3. Finally, you can cross out each item on the tree as you go, and give accurate estimates to leaders of when it'll be resolved. No more, ""we're not sure when it'll be fixed. It's too ambiguous."" 

To apply it yourself, before your next message, think about how you can communicate using a ""tree structure"" like the one on the right. Avoid windy roads and darts.

Have you heard of MECE before and where else do you think you can use it?

What makes a real difference are people, and that's why it's so important to know which skills to develop.

When I seek new engineers or EMs, these are the five categories of soft skills I look for:

🧠 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ Traits and abilities that define how individuals manage themselves and react to situations, such as resilience and self-awareness.

🤝 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ Abilities enabling positive interactions and teamwork, like empathy and conflict resolution.

🗣️ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ The capacity to convey and receive information clearly, through speaking, writing, and body language.

🗂️ 𝗢𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ The ability to plan, prioritize, and manage resources and tasks efficiently.

👑 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ Qualities that inspire and guide others, including decision-making, motivation, and team building.

Many believe these skills are innate, but I assure you that, like hard skills, you can learn soft skills and become a better engineer or leader.

In my newsletter today (a bit late due to a bad flu), I delved deeper into soft skills, giving practical advice on training and balancing them based on your career path.

Just an amusing reminder that what you see talked about in the press/media/social media is not really the reality of many devs. And how more ""niche"" use cases are becoming really helpful for these AI coding tools.

As context, recently more typos made it into The Pragmatic Engineer: sorry about this! I was confused how this keeps happening, because we do 2 rounds of manual edits with my editor, and then a final spellcheck with Grammarly. And yet, typos in company names or product names kept getting through!

Well, turns out that Grammarly does not flag typos in e.g. ""ChatGTP"" (see the typo?) or company names.

If we would be talking about a 1990s spell checker, I could make this pass, because these are words that are not in a dictionary. But Grammarly claims to be AI-powered!

Curiously, all other LLMs (Claude, Gemini etc) all find the spelling errors that Grammarly cannot spot.

And this is the story of how we changed our final spell check from Grammarly (that doesn't do its job, when this is its only job!) to a general-purpose LLM that does it (when this is not even its job, it's just good at it).

I was a paying customer for Grammarly for 5+ years, and this was disappointing. The final check with a tool to filter out typos left in the text will now happen with Claude or Gemini.

""AI"" is not replacing SaaS businesses: but SaaS businesses that do not keep up with capabilities general LLMs already could well lose customers.

It's a lightweight configuration-based approach.

This actually came out of the effort done in Aspire.

If you're new to this concept, here's a quick breakdown.

Service discovery allows developers to reference external services using logical names instead of physical IP addresses and ports.

There's a centralized store for services to register themselves.

Clients can query the service registry to find the service's physical address.

The service discovery library for .NET is simpler, though.

It still lets you use logical names to refer to external services.

However, the discovery side is ""lacking"".

You have to specify the physical addresses in the application settings.

Here's a step-by-step tutorial: https://lnkd.in/eX4Wy3jD

You can configure the service URLs during deployment in your CI/CD pipelines.

Or even use a central configuration store (Azure App Configuration) for service discovery URLs.

1. Basic Authentication: Clients include a Base64-encoded username and password in every request header, which is simple but insecure since credentials are transmitted in plaintext. Useful in quick prototypes or internal services over secure networks.
2. Session Authentication: After login, the server creates a session record and issues a cookie. Subsequent requests send that cookie so the server can validate user state. Used in traditional web-apps.
3. Token Authentication: Clients authenticate once to receive a signed token, then present the token on each request for stateless authentication. Used in single-page applications and modern APIs that require scalable, stateless authentication.
4. OAuth-Based Authentication: Clients obtain an access token via an authorization grant from an OAuth provider, then use that token to call resource servers on the user’s behalf. Used in cases of third-party integrations or apps that need delegated access to user data.
5. API Key Authentication: Clients present a predefined key (often in headers or query strings) with each request. The server verifies the key to authorize access. Used in service-to-service or machine-to-machine APIs where simple credential checks are sufficient.

Over to you: Which other API Authentication method have you seen?

When you type ""Hello world"" into ChatGPT or Claude, the model isn't processing those letters and spaces like you're reading this post right now. It's converting everything into numbers through a process most people never think about.

Preprocessing comes first. Text gets normalized. Unicode characters, spacing quirks, and special symbols, they all get cleaned up and standardized. ""Hello world"" becomes a consistent format that the model can actually work with.

Then comes tokenization. This is where things get interesting. The model splits text into tokens, and there are different approaches.

1 - Character-based tokenization breaks everything down to individual characters. ""Hello world"" becomes [""H"", ""e"", ""l"", ""l"", ""o"", "" "", ""w"", ""o"", ""r"", ""l"", ""d""]. Simple but inefficient.

2 - Word-based splits on whole words. [""Hello"", ""world""]. Cleaner but struggles with rare words and creates massive vocabularies.

3 - Subword-based is what modern LLMs actually use. GPT, Gemini, Claude, they all rely on this. ""Hello world"" becomes something like [""Hell"", ""o"", ""world""]. It balances efficiency with flexibility, handling rare words by breaking them into known subword pieces.

The final step is Token IDs. Those subwords get mapped to numbers like [15496, 345, 995]. Each token ID corresponds to an embedding vector inside the model. That's what the neural network actually processes.

Over to you: Why do some models handle code better than natural language? Is it the tokenizer?

I had the privilege to keynote the first day 🙏 and I brought some thoughts about how software engineering teams should think about AI.

The truth is everything these days feels shaky and early, so I believe good mental models are more useful than specific practices. And my favorite one is: 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗜.

What’s evident from the countless conversations and data points we have been collecting over the past few months, is that if you have good engineering practices in place, AI is going to amplify them. 

AI thrives on the same things humans thrive on: good docs, clear abstractions, good testing, small batches. It also makes it *easier* to implement them, by lifting a lot of grunt work off of our shoulders.

So the ROI of good engineering is just skyrocketing: good practices are now easier to put in place + more valuable, because they benefit both human and AI productivity.

The opposite is also true: if your house is a mess, AI is just going to create more mess.

So, all in all, there’s never been a better time to be a software engineer — let’s get to work!

In-Memory Caching (IMemoryCache):
✅ Blazing fast (nanoseconds).
❌ Data is stuck on one server. If you have 10 nodes, you have 10 caches.

Distributed Caching (IDistributedCache / Redis):
✅ Shared across all servers. Consistent data.
❌ Network latency. Serialization costs. It's slower.

The Solution: HybridCache.

Don't choose one. Use both.

A Hybrid Cache creates a tiered architecture:

- L1 (Local): The app checks RAM first. If it's there, return instantly.
- L2 (Distributed): If missing locally, check Redis.
- Source: If missing in Redis, fetch from DB, then populate both L1 and L2.

While Microsoft is working on a native implementation, I still swear by FusionCache as the most robust, battle-tested library for this.

I wrote a guide on how to set this up properly: https://lnkd.in/d6NKgMVp

Are you currently using just Redis, or a multi-layer cache?

You type a domain name and hit enter, but what actually happens before that webpage loads is more complex than most people realize. DNS is the phonebook of the internet, and every request you make triggers a chain of lookups across multiple servers. 

Step 1: Someone types bytebytego. com into their browser and presses enter. 

Step 2: Before doing anything, the browser looks for a cached IP address. Operating system cache gets checked too. 

Step 3: Cache miss triggers a DNS query. The browser sends a query to the configured DNS resolver, usually provided by your ISP or a service like Google DNS or Cloudflare.

Step 4: Resolver checks its own cache. 

Step 5-6: If the resolver doesn't have the answer cached, it asks the root servers, “Where can I find .com?” For bytebytego. com, the root server responds with the address of the .com TLD name server. 

Step 7-8: Resolver queries the .com TLD server. TLD server returns the authoritative server address. 

Step 9-10: This server has the actual A/AAAA record mapping the domain to an IP address. The resolver finally gets the answer: 172. 67. 21. 11 for bytebytego. com.

Step 11-12: The IP gets cached at the resolver level for future lookups, and returned to the browser.

Step 13-14: The browser stores this for its own future use, and uses the IP to make the actual HTTP request. 

Step 15: The web server returns the requested content.

All this happens in milliseconds, before your first page even starts loading.

Over to you: Which DNS tools or commands do you rely on most, dig, nslookup, or something else?

The API endpoint's only responsibility becomes:

1. Accepting a request
2. Constructing a command/query object
3. Sending it to the respective handler and getting a result

The best part?

You don't need MediatR.

And no, it's not about food. It's about being a great Engineering Manager.

The perfect blend for effective Engineering Management doesn't come from just technical ingredients alone, there's much more.

Here's what you need:

👂 40% Listen: active listening is your base. It ensures that your team feels heard and valued, fostering a collaborative environment.

🔄 30% Align: alignment to keep everyone on the same path towards common goals should be your day-to-day focus.

👥 20% Mentor: add a generous spoon of mentorship to empower and grow your team's skills and careers.

💻 10% Code: a dash of coding keeps you connected with your team's work and the challenges they face.

As with every respected Italian recipe, there's also a secret ingredient.

🙌 Be Human: empathy, compassion, and emotional intelligence make all the difference.

What's your take on this recipe?

It’s Christmas Eve, so it’s time for a bit of a special announcement. After working on it for several months, today we are introducing our new brand, developed with my long-time friends Matteo, Emily, and Sergio from Moze.

I have always been extremely protective of how Refactoring looks and feels, so this has been a very personal work for me. We went back to the basics of what makes Refactoring… Refactoring: what I write about, what I stand for, and what makes it unique.

I am incredibly proud of the final result. We tweaked everything: the logo, the colors, the main design elements — we even designed a new font! All while still feeling 100% Refactoring. 

Let me know if you like it!

I have also written about the whole process and lessons learned in the latest newsletter edition, which I attach in the comments 👇

It's a review of ""How to Take Smart Notes"" — a book that completely ","Today I published an article about something very close to my heart: note-taking. It's a review of ""How to Take Smart Notes"" — a book that completely changed how I work and think 👇

This book introduced me to the 𝗭𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗸𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻 method used by Niklas Luhmann, who published 70+ books and 400+ scientific papers in 30 years (!!). His secret? A system of 90,000 interconnected notes that acted as his second brain.

But here's the thing: after 5 years and 600+ notes of my own, I've learned that you don't need to copy Luhmann exactly. In fact, I don’t. You need something sustainable that works for you.

Here are some things I learned:

↳ ✍️ 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 — you don't write to capture thoughts: you write to create them. Writing forces linear thinking and reveals both meaning and inconsistencies.

↳ 🍱 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 — separate capture (save everything raw), organize (periodic review), and express (create output). Trying to do all at once == writer's block.

↳ 📥 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗳 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝘁 — during my weekly review, I delete most of what I captured in the prior days. And that's fine!

↳ 🪣 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘀 — I organize notes by actionability. Projects have deadlines, responsibilities recur, while topics are just areas of interests.

↳ 🤖 𝗔𝗜 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗲 — I have found that AI is great for capturing and summarizing content, but organizing is where I need make the connections. We can’t outsource your thinking. Same thing with writing.

So, after 260+ articles and 600+ notes, I confirm: good note-taking compounds — but it's a journey. 

As in software, it's not about creating a perfect system: it's about a workflow that grows with you, which you keep iterating on.

A Staff Engineer at Pinterest exposed my mistake: within 2 weeks, he knew more about the codebase than me, even though I had been working in that area for a year.

Not only did he ramp up dramatically faster, he was able to understand the abstractions far better than me. 

After a few more weeks, he understood several abstractions and libraries more deeply than anyone in the entire company.

Expertise is not something you magically get when you become senior enough. It's a prerequisite for seniority, and you can start building expertise today.

You can become more knowledgeable than anyone as long as you narrow the scope appropriately. e.g. ""In one afternoon, I can understand more about the flags to configure git log compared to anyone on my team of 10 people.""

Observation.

As an introvert, I enjoy observing and listening to other people, and this is what has brought me to where I am today and continues to keep me learning.

This is how:

🛠️ I became an Engineer:
⮑ When I was younger, I observed many other engineers. How they approached problems, how they built resilient systems, how they coded.

👥 I became an Engineering Manager:
⮑ At one point in my career, I found myself in the EM position without any previous experience. I started following other EMs or just managers, read about their experiences, and asked them to share their learnings.

👨‍💼 I became a Director:
⮑ As with the EM role, there were no courses to learn how to play in this position. That's why I approached other people in these roles, observed the ones in my company, and learned from them.

✍️ I recently became a newsletter author:
⮑ I'm not bad at writing; in fact, I love it. But writing for a wider audience and in a language that isn't your first, that's something else. That's why before launching my newsletter, I approached other writers, listened to their experiences, and took a lot of inspiration from all of them.

Books are a good way to learn. 

Doing things yourself and learning from mistakes is a great way to learn. 

💡 Observing, listening, and imitating other people is, in my opinion, still the best and fastest way to learn something.

How do you learn?

❌ Not caring for people from the beginning.

You spend an incredible amount of effort to hire someone:

- kicking off the hiring process
- assessing hundreds of profiles
- doing tons of interviews
- checking a lot of code challenges

Then, you find a talent that perfectly fits your team. You get them onboarded, and since everything seems to be going well, you forget about them.

Eventually, perhaps after a year or two, you start to notice signs of disengagement from this team member. You sense their unhappiness, until the day they ask for a meeting to announce their resignation.

And so you ask if there's something you can do to change their mind, offering a salary raise or more benefits.

But guess what? It's too late.

I've learned that the hard way. 

As soon as you onboard a new team member, that's when you have to start caring about them and ensuring:

🤝 Regular check-ins (1:1s): focus on how they're feeling, not just updates on what they've accomplished.

💰 Proactive salary reviews: if your team members are performing well, they deserve recognition through raises. And while the budget isn't always under your control, it's your duty to advocate for them.

🌱 Comprehensive support: offer mentorship and development opportunities to help them grow. Make them feel valued not just for their work but for their potential.

⚖️ Work-life balance: encourage a healthy balance. Overworking can lead to burnout, which no raise can compensate for.

Ever wondered why your app feels slow even when the bandwidth looks fine? Latency and throughput explain two very different stories of performance.

Latency measures the delay per packet. It is what users feel when they click a button. It’s responsiveness. It is the time for one request to travel from the server to the end device. This includes server processing time, queuing delays, propagation through the network, transmission delays, and the last-mile connection to the user's device. 

Throughput measures volume per second. It is how much data successfully gets delivered in a given timeframe. Not how fast each packet moves, but how many packets flow through the pipe. Throughput is capacity. High throughput means the system handles the load without choking.

Over to you: How do you measure these metrics in a way that actually predicts when things will break?

This might seem trivial, but it has deep implications. The main one is that you should focus your quality work on 𝗵𝗼𝘁𝘀𝗽𝗼𝘁𝘀 (cit. Adam Tornhill): the parts of your codebase that are frequently subject to change.

As humans we are bad at judging this intuitively, so a lot of work on tech debt is simply misguided: it either happens on bad—but stable—code, or on areas that are active but already in relatively good shape.

This is also hard to evaluate because activity distribution is extremely skewed: in most codebases, ~5% of the code gets 90% of the activity.

This reminds me of something from my startup days.

During an M&A conversation, the buyer’s consulting firm ran a technical due diligence. They found several areas of poor quality code—as we expected. In fact, over time we had doubled down on specific parts of the product we cared about, while phasing out others. The latter stayed experimental: less testing, more duplication, etc.

What I didn’t expect was how hard this proved to be to argue. We pointed to the strategic parts we were proud of, but they weighted the sketchy marginal code as an equal part of the whole.

In other words, the 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 wasn’t considered.

Eventually the M&A failed for a variety of reasons. This was not explicitly mentioned as a blocker, but I always suspected it contributed.

I had a chat with Adam a few months ago that influenced a lot of how I think about this topic.

Testing is one of the topics on which I receive the most questions from the newsletter. But these are usually not like: “how do I test things thoroughly?"" But rather “how do I get the best bang for my buck?”

So as always YMMV, but here is my quick cheat sheet:

𝟭) 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲

Most languages today have statically typed versions you can adopt, e.g. Typescript for Javascript, or Sorbet for Ruby.

My opinion is that this is a no-brainer for 99% of teams.

Static types catch a ton of bugs early, make AI safer, and self-document the code.

𝟮) 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 *𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁*

Unit tests are an important part of your testing investment. However, I am not adamant about their coverage — you should write them for whatever is non-trivial or subject to implementation changes in the future.

𝟯) 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀

Integration tests are about testing execution paths that involve multiple functions / components. Figure out the most important ones for each area of your product, and test them in depth. 

To identify them, you can think about business paths based on how your product is used. API endpoints are also usually good candidates.

Sometimes, the difference between unit and integration is a bit murky, but it doesn’t matter. Just focus on what feels worthwhile to be tested.

𝟰) 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗳𝗲𝘄, 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗻𝗱-𝘁𝗼-𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀

E2E tests are expensive to develop and maintain. My rule of thumb is to invest in testing those parts that you would check manually anyway. The entire goal of E2E is to remove manual checks, so you can release faster.

If you are an e-commerce, you may start by testing the main purchase funnel, checkout included. If you are a SaaS, you may test that new customers are able to subscribe, and the core features used by your existing ones.

𝟱) 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻

I wrote a full article about this, but the TL;DR is you can probably avoid a staging environment by implementing some combination of canary rollouts and live PR previews. I also have a friend who also does video walkthroughs for PR, and they look great.

The idea is: the fewer steps to production, the faster you release, the better feedback loop you have, which also helps stability because you recover faster from mistakes.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucaronin_what-does-minimum-viable-testing-look-like-activity-7401539753243901952-nrIt?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAChrmHMBoeF2TJr0KNDHwGzHHBzLvrGpHx8

Career growth, mentoring, 1:1s, and other duties are crucial for an Engineering Manager, but the first and most important thing your team needs is to be empowered to do their job.

Removing any blockers that could arise in their daily job is the best thing you can do to empower them.

What does it mean in practice?

🔧 Identifying and helping resolve technical issues that could affect projects.

🤝 Facilitating clear and open communication by resolving any conflicts that could arise among team members.

📚 Providing resources and opportunities for professional development to help team members expand their skills and knowledge to solve blockers.

⚖️ Balancing project efforts with team capacity, ensuring workloads are manageable, and expectations are realistic.

🔄 Using tools and ways of working that make things go smoother and quicker.

🛡️ Creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable raising their hands to report any blockers at any time.

What are other ways to remove blockers that I might have missed?

This is the hidden danger of the standard Options Pattern in .NET.

You might bind your appsettings.json to a class, inject it, and everything looks fine. The app starts up perfectly.

But if a required API Key is missing? You won't know until a user triggers that specific feature, and the app crashes.

This is why ""Fail Fast"" is crucial for configuration.

If your config is invalid, your application should refuse to start. Period.

You can achieve this by extending the Options Pattern with IValidateOptions.

Instead of just binding data, you attach validation logic:

1. Define rules (e.g., ""ApiKey cannot be null"", ""RetryCount must be > 0"").
2. Register the validator.
3. If the config breaks the rules, the DI container throws an exception immediately at startup.

I took this a step further and integrated FluentValidation to make the rules cleaner and more expressive.

Here is the complete implementation code: https://lnkd.in/djz5Yfux

Don’t waste this opportunity with questions that don’t matter, or that you can ask your recruiter.

Here are some questions I like to help me understand team health & company culture:

- How much vacation have you taken this year?
- What is the process when an incident happens on production? While you’re asleep?
- How do you know what to work on next?
- If you learn something really cool, how do you share that with the other engineers?
- What is something you’d change about the company?
- What would cause you to leave the company?
- How messy is engineering? Do you feel empowered to fix the mess?
- Do you deploy code on Fridays?
- What is the manager’s leadership style?
- Are you working on a promotion? How do you stay on track?
- What are some fun facts about your teammates?

You likely won’t have time for every one of these, so pick and choose what feels right in the moment, and what you need most to know.

The photo is from Kinokuniya Shinjuku, the flagship bookstore complex in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. It is probably the most famous and historic book retailer in Japan. It's a multi-floor shop with a massive selection, known for its wide range of specialized books. You can see two copies of The Software Engineer's Guidebook on the top shelf on the picture.

The Japanese version of The Software Engineer's Guidebook launched two weeks ago, translated by Ryuichi Kubuki (thank you for the phenomenal work!) published by O'Reilly Japan. O’Reilly told me that the book was temporarily out of stock for a few days, thanks to stronger-than-expected demand.

I love how the book's cover is very different from the English version - though if you zoom in you can see ""The Software Engineer's Guidebook"" in English showing up on the left side of the book.

If you live in Japan, you can order the book on Amazon Japan and find it in book stores: https://lnkd.in/e7FE2EXB

🏖️ It was nothing too fancy. I simply chose to take a two-week break, completely disconnected from everything.

I admit, I was a bit afraid about stepping away from LinkedIn, my newsletter, my job, and everything else. The fear of losing touch with my audience was real, but I had to weigh that against burnout, something I'm all too familiar with.

 So, I took the 'risk' and disconnected for two weeks.

Guess what?

🎉 Nothing bad happened and the best part is that I came back much more relaxed, with tons of fresh ideas for 2024.

Sometimes we're so engaged in what we love doing, that it becomes challenging to step back and take a break. But here's a reminder: it's better to 'lose' two weeks to rest than to face burnout and potentially lose months, or even a year.

💡 To help manage my work-life balance, I've developed a personal framework that I call the '3-3-3 Anti-Burnout Rule'. 

This means dedicating: 

- at least 3 hours each week
- 3 days each month,
- 3 weeks each year 

to completely disconnect, rest, reflect, and self-assess. While I strive for more, I never go below these thresholds.

🚀 This not only keeps me away from burnout, but it also helps sharpen and skyrocket my productivity.

And you? Are you taking any regular fully disconnected time?

Accepting bad behavior.

Being tolerant with your people, accepting them making mistakes is perfectly fine; but there are several unwritten rules and behaviors that should generally never be accepted because they can undermine teamwork, trust, and productivity.

Some of them include:

🚫 Disrespect: any form of disrespect towards team members.
🙅‍♂️ Bullying or Harassment: making fun of or bothering others.
🧨 Undermining Others: deliberately sabotaging or undermining a colleague's work.
❌ Ignoring Decisions: once a decision is made by the team, ignoring or actively working against it.
🙈 Not Acknowledging Mistakes: failing to take responsibility for errors.
🏆 Taking Credit for Others' Work: claiming others' achievements as one's own.
💸 Misusing Resources: using team resources for personal gain.
🤐 Breaking Confidentiality: sharing sensitive information without authorization.

  
In the past, it happened to me to accept some of these behaviors. I did that in good faith, with all the best intentions and to avoid losing some key people.

But that was a huge mistake.

Protecting one person can sometimes put the whole team at risk.

What are other bad behaviors you should not accept in a team?

Result Pagination: 
This method is used to optimize large result sets by streaming them back to the client, enhancing service responsiveness and user experience.

Asynchronous Logging: 
This approach involves sending logs to a lock-free buffer and returning immediately, rather than dealing with the disk on every call. Logs are periodically flushed to the disk, significantly reducing I/O overhead.

Data Caching: 
Frequently accessed data can be stored in a cache to speed up retrieval. Clients check the cache before querying the database, with data storage solutions like Redis offering faster access due to in-memory storage.

Payload Compression: 
To reduce data transmission time, requests and responses can be compressed (e.g., using gzip), making the upload and download processes quicker.

Connection Pooling: 
This technique involves using a pool of open connections to manage database interaction, which reduces the overhead associated with opening and closing connections each time data needs to be loaded. The pool manages the lifecycle of connections for efficient resource use.

😖 My impatience.

As an individual contributor, you receive a task, complete it, and feel rewarded.

However, as an Engineering Leader, immediate results are rare.

You must work diligently to achieve larger projects, guide your team toward your vision, and influence others.

⏳ This process takes time. Depending on the goal, it could take weeks, months, or even years.

For this reason, it's quite easy to focus on daily failures instead of concentrating on the bigger picture, which is often better than what you believed.

It's a mental exercise that takes time to get used to.

Here's what helped me:

📝 Journaling: being able to reflect on past experiences helps maintain perspective on the bigger picture.

♻️ Establishing routines: sometimes, the Engineering Leader role feels intangible in terms of daily work. Establishing routines contributes to making progress more visible.

📚 Viewing failures as learning opportunities: don't be discouraged by failures, as they provide valuable lessons for both you and your team.

🌟 Celebrating successes: acknowledge and celebrate achievements, both big and small, within your team. This helps reinforce the idea of progress.

What strategies do you use to overcome impatience?

1. Start a company
This is the route of a lot of uncertainty and continuous learning on the job. But the returns on this may be immense.

2. Become a founding engineer
This is especially for someone who is good at building MVPs.

3. Go through the Management path
The more you grow in the management path, the more you become a good fit for mid+ size companies as a CTO.

4. Go through the Architecture path
This might be a good path for you if you like to still stay in technical details and you love to design great systems. But keep in mind that as a CTO of mid+ size companies, you won’t be doing that anymore.

5. Go through the IC path
You are a good fit for small-size companies, but you will need to learn the management skills for mid+ size companies.

6. Become a CTO through other roles, mostly Product

1. Start a company
This is the route of a lot of uncertainty and continuous learning on the job. But the returns on this may be immense.

2. Become a founding engineer
This is especially for someone who is good at building MVPs.

3. Go through the Management path
The more you grow in the management path, the more you become a good fit for mid+ size companies as a CTO.

4. Go through the Architecture path
This might be a good path for you if you like to still stay in technical details and you love to design great systems. But keep in mind that as a CTO of mid+ size companies, you won’t be doing that anymore.

5. Go through the IC path
You are a good fit for small-size companies, but you will need to learn the management skills for mid+ size companies.

6. Become a CTO through other roles, mostly Product

That file was never meant to hold production credentials, yet I see it in real projects all the time.

I just published a new walkthrough where I show how to secure your .NET apps with Azure Key Vault:

- Creating your first Key Vault
- The exact RBAC roles you actually need
- Storing secrets with versioning
- Authenticating with DefaultAzureCredential
- Pulling secrets directly into ASPNET Core configuration
- Loading connection strings + options without touching appsettings

It’s a clean setup that keeps your sensitive values out of the repo and follows Azure’s best practices.

But then you don't.

More work to come, new projects, new prospects. More, more, more. Until recharging becomes impossible.

🔥 Welcome to burnout.

This silent beast is bad for your personal life and your work. It drains your energy, creativity, enthusiasm, and joy.

Been there, done that. 

How to avoid it? 

💡 Switch Your Mindset: more doesn't mean better. Working more doesn't lead to promotions; working smarter does.

🚧 Set Boundaries: define your work hours and stick to them. Make it clear to your colleagues and yourself when you're 'off the clock'.

🛑 Take Regular Breaks: short, frequent breaks throughout the day can help you maintain consistent productivity and prevent mental fatigue.

🙅 Learn to Say No: you can't do everything. Taking on too much is the surest way to burn out.

🔋 Prioritize Your Energy Sources: Family? Friends? Sports? Whatever gives you energy and joy, make it a priority.

I recommend taking a look at System Threading Channels.

You can implement a simple in-memory message bus using Channels in .NET.

Channels implement the producer-consumer pattern:

- Producers asynchronously produce data
- Consumers asynchronously consume that data

A channel has a Writer and Reader, that you can use to publish and consume messages. respectively.

Here's how you can use this to implement a simple message bus: https://lnkd.in/ekfJZd5n

Remember that this is still an in-memory bus, so it's not reliable.

You can implement resiliency around this, but it only goes so far.

What are some of the algorithms you should know before taking system design interviews?

I put together a list and explained why they are important. Those algorithms are not only useful for interviews but good to understand for any software engineer. 

One thing to keep in mind is that understanding “how those algorithms are used in real-world systems” is generally more important than the implementation details in a system design interview.

What do the stars mean in the diagram?
It’s very difficult to rank algorithms by importance objectively. I’m open to suggestions and making adjustments. 

Five-star: Very important. Try to understand how it works and why.

Three-star: Important to some extent. You may not need to know the implementation details.

One-star: Advanced. Good to know for senior candidates.

Over to you: did I miss anything important on the list? Which ones do you know and which you don’t?

You open a Pull Request (PR). You wait. And when you finally get feedback, it’s just nitpicks about formatting or style.

That doesn't help you ship better software. It just slows you down.

I’ve been testing out 𝗔𝘂𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 and their new Code Review feature. I have to say, it feels different.

Most AI tools only look at the few lines of code you changed. They act like a basic spellchecker.

Augment acts like a Senior Engineer.

I typed auggie review on my PR, saw the little 👀 emoji pop up, and waited. Here is what surprised me:

1. 𝗜𝘁 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: It looks at your entire repository, not just the file you touched. It caught a breaking change I made that would have broken a different part of the app.

2. 𝗡𝗼 𝗻𝗼𝗶𝘀𝗲: It didn't nag me about style. It focused on real logic bugs and security risks.

3. 𝗜𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝗿𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀: You can add a simple YAML file to teach it your team's specific guidelines.

It helps you catch the bad stuff, like edge cases and logic errors, before you merge.

If you want an AI that actually understands how you build software, give this a try.

Check it out here: https://fandf.co/4phaDOt

𝗠𝘆 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲: Don't skip the custom code review guidelines file. If you take five minutes to list your team's specific rules, the AI stops guessing and starts reviewing exactly the way you want it to. It saves you from repeating the same comments over and over.

API (Application Programming Interface) and SDK (Software Development Kit) are essential tools in the software development world, but they serve distinct purposes: 
 
API: 
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications and services to communicate with each other. 
 
1. It defines how software components should interact. 
2. Facilitates data exchange and functionality access between software components. 
3. Typically consists of endpoints, requests, and responses. 
 
SDK: 
An SDK is a comprehensive package of tools, libraries, sample code, and documentation that assists developers in building applications for a particular platform, framework, or hardware. 
 
1. Offers higher-level abstractions, simplifying development for a specific platform. 
2. Tailored to specific platforms or frameworks, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance on that platform. 
3. Offer access to advanced features and capabilities specific to the platform, which might be otherwise challenging to implement from scratch. 
 
The choice between APIs and SDKs depends on the development goals and requirements of the project. 
 
Over to you: 
Which do you find yourself gravitating towards – APIs or SDKs – Every implementation has a unique story to tell. What's yours?

A While(true) loop with a Thread.Sleep() is not the answer.

You need a robust scheduler that understands Cron Expressions.

A Cron expression allows you to define complex recurring schedules with a compact string.

For example:

• 15 10 * * * = 10:15 AM every day.
• 15 10 * * MON-FRI = 10:15 AM, but only on weekdays.

In the .NET ecosystem, the heavyweight champion for this is Quartz.

It parses these expressions for you and ensures your background services fire exactly when they are supposed to.

Clean code principles ","Clean code tip:

- Merge nested IF statements into one condition

I often make this simple change to improve code readability.

Clean code principles will make you a better developer.

But what is clean code in the first place?

Clean code is code that's:

- Easy to read
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand

Writing clean code is a skill.

It's a skill you can learn and improve with practice.

In the initial example:

- Nesting increases complexity
- Nesting makes the code harder to reason about

The solution is to combine the nested IF statements into a single IF.

Three ways you can do this:

- Write an inline boolean expression
- Expose a method with the expression
- Create a variable with the expression

But this is just the start.

Here are 8 more clean code tips: https://lnkd.in/dt84mr9J

. 
. 
What are the differences? 
 
When we 𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐬 from one Git branch to another, we can use ‘git merge’ or ‘git rebase’. The diagram below shows how the two commands work. 
 
𝐆𝐢𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞 
This creates a new commit G’ in the main branch. G’ ties the histories of both main and feature branches. 
 
Git merge is 𝐧𝐨𝐧-𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞. Neither the main nor the feature branch is changed. 
 
𝐆𝐢𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 
Git rebase moves the feature branch histories to the head of the main branch. It creates new commits E’, F’, and G’ for each commit in the feature branch. 
 
The benefit of rebase is that it has 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲. 
 
Rebase can be dangerous if “the golden rule of git rebase” is not followed.

In my experience, ","As managers, we always say we should cut meetings whose value is low, that is, lower than the opportunity cost of attendees' time.

In my experience, though, this is tricky to judge. The ROI of ceremonies is often not linear, e.g:

↳ Daily standups may feel like a waste of time until you casually intercept a big blocker.
↳ Retrospectives may seem shallow until a project goes bad and it prompts a real discussion.

Some processes are simply designed to run *at a loss* most of the time, and then have a few instances that repay the whole bill.

I feel that, as humans, we are bad at assessing these situations. When the value distribution is uneven, we need longer feedback loops — and we don’t like that.

This is one of the cruxes of moving from IC to management. As an engineer, most feedback loops are extremely short: you write code, it works, deploy to prod, check how it goes. As a manager, good luck with that! When it comes to how your team works—as a system—you need many cycles to figure out how things are doing.

What I like to call a “New Leader Syndrome” is when you feel that you need to showcase an extraordinary amount of effort or competence to justify that you deserve to lead that project or team.

And for every individual, it shows up differently:

1. Working extra hours and staying a long time in the office to “show” everyone how great and committed you are

2. Trying to be the best at everything, while also leading the team

3. Always being available and quickly responding to every question

4. It’s also common for more experienced leaders as well, and it shows when they feel pressured to make quick, visible changes to prove their value

So, this is my advice: When you first step into leadership, it’s common to feel the need to prove yourself by doing more. Extra effort at the beginning is normal, but if you make it unsustainable, that’s not.

Leadership is not about being perfect or doing everything yourself. It’s about solving the right problems, setting clear expectations, and enabling others to succeed.

Make it a ""which one"" decision. And make your recommendation the obvious choice.

When you say ""Can I do <x>?"" it's a ""yes"" or ""no"" decision. Most of the time, especially when your request might be to another team, the easiest thing is for them to say no. That keeps the status quo which feels safe.

When you provide options, it makes the best choice for the business clear and easy to pick.

Here's a before and after example.

❌ Before: Can you add rate limiting to the search endpoint? Our frontend is sending too many requests.

✅ After:
Hi team, we're seeing high request volumes on the search endpoint. We have a few options to address this:
1. Backend rate limiting (recommended). All clients will be supported out of the box.
2. Add client side throttling. However, all clients will need to be updated
3. If we do nothing, we'll keep hitting our max load and failing requests

What are your thoughts?

This is a simplified example, but the ""after"" did a few things:
• It reduces cognitive load by calling out ways we can solve it up front
• It makes it really weird to choose option 3. It's clear that (1) or (2) will be better than doing nothing. 
• It makes it really easy to pick option 1. It's already been laid out as recommended and shows why it's the best choice.

Combined, it leads to you getting the outcome you want.

This is the most important post I'll ever write. My son is turning 21 tomorrow, August 23rd. For the last 2.5 years, he has been bravely battling Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), a rare and under-researched cancer.

ASPS is driven by a specific gene fusion protein (ASPSCR1-TFE3). This protein is the engine of his cancer, yet we lack a detailed understanding of its structure. This is where we see a path for hope, and where I desperately need your help.

We are searching for brilliant minds—individuals, researchers, or institutions—with expertise in using AlphaFold to create a 3D model of this specific fusion protein. Creating this structural ""blueprint"" is not just an academic exercise; it's a critical step that could allow us to identify this protein's vulnerabilities. The ultimate goal is to find existing, approved drugs that could be repurposed to ""fit"" and disable this engine, opening up new, out-of-the-box treatment strategies.

The power of the LinkedIn community is immense. A simple share could connect this plea to the one person or lab in the world that can help us move the needle in the fight against this rare disease.

My birthday wish for my son is hope, powered by action. Please, not only share this post but also ask your network to share it. You never know whose screen it might cross.

Thank you for your time and support.

We teamed up on today's guest post in HGE about storytelling (https://lnkd.in/e-38Pd66).

As you progress in your engineering career, the strong technical skills you've demonstrated won't be enough to get you promoted to the next level. They're necessary but not sufficient.

""What got you here won't get you there.""

Storytelling skills are incredibly important everywhere, but especially in tech as you move to higher levels. The job will increasingly be about convincing others of your ideas on a larger and larger scale. Storytelling does just that.

Here's why investing in writing is the best professional career move you can make👇🏽  

1️⃣ Writing is the fastest way to build a professional brand

- My water & tech focused newsletter has gone from 0 -> 3,663 subscribers in just over 12 months

- Customers, partners, and connections all appreciate learning about you and your interests outside of what your company does

- Easy way to stay top of mind with people you don't often connect with.

2️⃣ You can meet INCREDIBLE people from all over the world, many who become close friends and co-workers

- Writing online gives you 24/7 opportunities to find like minded people in places you may never visit in person. My life would be nowhere near as interesting without fellow writers like Cam, Robbie, Will, Stephen, Amanda, Karena, Florian, Louie, John, and Jim in it.

3️⃣ Refining your thinking leads to better business outcomes

- Your ability to clearly and concisely convey messages in writing, especially in a remote world, directly impacts your ability to be successful at work.

- It's always nice to avoid an extra meeting when it can be taken care of in an e-mail or memo.

If you're interested in learning where to start, the team at Write of Passage is putting on a series of free webinars next month that talk about how to start writing online.

During the last Infoshare 2025 Conference Jordan Cutler showed this slide: The engineering team structure we've known for years is changing, as we speak. Because AI and other tools / tech is more and more equipped in doing things for us, the skillset vs engineering role is shifting. 

👉 Junior is becoming a Mid
👉 Mid is becoming a Senior
👉 Senior transforming into Staff Engineer (with a part of completely different skills)

I wanted to come back to it because we had a great conversation with Ari Block during our Leman Tech Leadership Podcast recording session. We've discussed how there are big predictions about engineering teams in overall. Interesting and necessary trend to follow, and build risk management around it. So we take care of our teams and businesses as well.

As Louie Bacaj says in the screenshot, once sites like StackOverflow go, the quality of the content fed into LLMs goes down.

LLMs will also cannibalise themselves as they begin to feed off more and more LLM generated content.

Additionally, it's likely more sites will block LLMs from harvesting content as they're eating into their business models (as Twitter & Reddit already have).

So it's quite possible LLM output quality has already reached a zenith point (there are reports that OpenAI ChatGPT quality has already gone down, but due to cost saving efforts).

Jordan runs a very successful newsletter called High Growth Engineer (link here --> https://lnkd.in/gCaXyd6x). He gives lots of talks. He has lots of followers. He is successful. He's also a super nice guy.

I'm going to be giving bi-annual ""How to become a Staff+ Engineer"" webinars with O'Reilly. I have no idea how to market myself. I'm an engineer. That comes first, duh. But Jordan is a great engineer AND knows how to market himself. 

Here's to hoping I learned something from Jordan 🤞

One startup wants to change that:","Social media creates attention monsters. Instead of the most original thoughts, creators pursue the strongest hooks. One startup wants to change that:

How many layoff posts have you seen lately? Remote work copy-paste jobs?

When the incentive is to seek attention and get likes, behavior follows.

But compare social media to podcasts. The incentives are totally different. With a podcast feed, the creator is directly sending content to fans who have subscribed. So, instead, the incentive is for high QUALITY content.

Is it possible to create the same dynamic for writing? This inspired Chris, Hamish & Jairaj (pictured) to found Substack.

Their mission? “Make it simple to start a publication that makes money from subscriptions.” If they could create a new market of content, by making it economical for writers, they could create a new media.

So far, it’s been working. The last time we got subscriber numbers from Substack, they had over 1M paying subscribers. That was up ~100% from the year prior. At an average cost of $7 per month, and 10% take rate, that’s a yearly revenue of $8.4M. Not bad for a company <6 years old.

It’s working out for its content creators, too. The top 10 writers make over $20M a year combined. Lenny Rachitsky shared he makes more on Substack than he did as a PM at Airbnb. Substack is set to be the next Twitch or YouTube, each of which have 10K+ creators living on them.

What product strategy and positioning has allowed Substack to get to this point?

1. Substack offers true independence for writers.

You own your email list. So, you can always walk away. This is totally different from Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook’s options.

2. Substack focuses on making the experience easy & simple.

Time to publish is super low. Compared to competitor ConvertKit, Substack offers less customization, analytics, and advertising monetization features. It just makes writing super simple.

3. Substack gets the fundamentals, like SEO & deliverability really right.

My 1 year old Substack crushes my Wordpress blog of 10 years on SEO. Others have measured the same for email deliverability vs other providers. Substack is #1 in the 2 most important areas.

Substack can pursue this focused positioning because it is built for one persona:

· Not for social media personalities. They might prefer Twitter or LinkedIn’s offerings
· Not for techies. They might prefer Wordpress or ConvertKit
· For writers who wants to focus on writing.

What can we learn from Substack’s phenomenal product growth?

1. You can create wholly new markets, instead of competing in saturated one’s.
2. Simpler is better, especially if you have a focused persona.
3. Getting the basics really right, instead of just ok, is a great wedge.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aagupta_social-media-creates-attention-monsters-share-6961982499384086528-4d41?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADxYOckBu8T6EbKOBQFR0iEwlOaiwHUAksU

1. Stick to st","I just finished Louie Bacaj's excellent ""Timeless Career Advice For Software Engineers"" course!

Here are my top 10 takeaways from it:

1. Stick to startups/high-growth or big tech companies for a meaningful tech career

- Startups/high-growth companies to optimize for responsibility/scope
- Big tech companies to optimize for learning engineering best practices and compensation
- Work at companies where software directly ties to revenue (the product is the software itself)

2. Focus on ownership

- Stick to companies where software engineers are empowered to own and maintain their code (even after it's rolled out)
- Develop an ownership mindset - it's not your fault, but it's your responsibility

3. Deliver massive value

- What 20% of work will get you 80% of the results? Focus on that
- Make your code functional first
- Think about performance in B2C companies and maintainability in B2B companies

4. Develop an abundance mindset

- Find problems and opportunities to create more value in your product/system for your customers
- More problems you solve -> More resources for your company -> More rewards for you and your team

5. Build up your people skills

- Double down on relationships at work
- Empathise with your teammates and customers
- Learn to communicate effectively in conversations and meetings

6. Grow your influence through writing and speaking

- Write blog posts about your work - free credibility for you and your company
- Leverage opportunities to speak and present in meetings and presentations
- A public body of work >>> your resume
- Setup team and (eventually) company-wide initiatives. Ex: tech-talks, design reviews

7. Understand how promotions work

- Understand what the company values and deliver it. Different companies value different things
- Add value, make noise (in that order)
- Perform at the next level, and you'll be there soon

8. Leverage the power of 1 on 1 meetings

- Most important meetings of your career
- Take ownership of setting up 1 on 1's with key people - peers, product people, engineers and leaders (even from other teams) 

9. Nail your mid-year and annual reviews

- Take notes about your work and achievements weekly
- Write an excellent review for yourself

10. Master engineering concepts

- Data structures and algorithms
- One functional and one object-oriented language
- Design patterns and system design
- Concurrency and asynchronous programming
- Scalability, reliability and DevOps
- Domain-driven design

Lots more I couldn't cover here!

How do you grow beyond senior as a designer?

I've taken over 6 months to answer this question in the most actionable way in my new book.

Most senior designers do not want to become managers. So I focused on the IC-roles (whether it's called Staff, Lead, or Principal at your organization).

I researched how 50+ companies evaluate designers and employees, including Etsy, Medium, Dropbox, Square, Figma, Zendesk, and Intercom.

I also interviewed 19 product designers on their progression at Figma, Instacart, Dropbox, Etsy, Twitter, and smaller companies.

The book includes actionable techniques that helped other designers get promoted beyond senior: understanding business, finding project opportunities, setting standards, selling ideas, mentoring, increasing visibility, and more.

(If you’re mid/junior-level, check out my previous book The Path to Senior Designer).

They're concerned that if they don't, something will break.

But reviewing every Pull Request isn't feasible, and doesn't scale.

So, what should you do instead? 6 tips:

1️⃣ Enhance your delivery systems outside of code review.

Strengthen your release pipelines with tests, monitoring and rollback. This will help to prevent, detect and mitigate defects.

2️⃣ Document code review processes.

Team members should be aware of the expected size, scope and structure for each PR. Add automated checks for testing and approval.

3️⃣ Establish paradigms.

Introduce design patterns and structure to the codebase, that others can leverage and build on top of.

4️⃣ Integrate automated tools.

Use linters and formatters to ensure consistent style. Set up automated static code analysis.

5️⃣ Teach your team to review effectively.

Emphasize the importance of kindness, clarity, and thoroughness. Identify when blocking is or isn't appropriate.

6️⃣ Be aware of what's being shipped to production.

Slack/GitHub integration works well. Know when to scan a pull request, and when to do a thorough dive.

🔑 Remember: You can't write and review all the code for your team. If you could, hiring others would be pointless.

💡 Instead: put your team in position to ship better software, faster.

Leadership is an amplification mechanism. 
Whatever you do gets amplified and comes back to you 10X. 
There is nowhere to hide. 

You can do the opposite but it’s not sustainable in the long run.
This is not a morality position.
Rather, it’s a performance position. 

Teams with the above characteristics simply outperform others in the long run.

Stop thinking about how AI will eliminate your role and start thinking about how it will elevate it. Jordan Cutler’s advice? Diversify your skillset:

“Develop your people and AI skills, use AI to solve problems and ensure you have the people skills to work with *anyone*”.

He advises entry-level engineers to follow the 3 E’s framework:

- Education: Evolve your understanding of the foundations, for example, embeddings and AI's probabilistic nature and randomness. There are AI courses on Udemy that can help.

- Exposure: Curate your “information diet” and read content from credible experts (e.g., Ruben Hassid), whether in newsletters or following them on LinkedIn.

- Experience: Start building products. AI can guide you to an output, and you’ll quickly understand whether your code has worked.

For more tenured engineers, he recommends using AI to improve communication and design better systems:
- Use tools like v0 to get to a higher fidelity prototype with minimal effort
- Use tools like WriteEdge and @chatPRD to discuss/debate ideas

In summary: use AI to reduce the “time to value” for a product

We discuss this and more in this week’s edition of Hiring Humans (We also share some great resources to feed your information diet too 👀)",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charchris-sloan_now-is-the-time-to-upskill-stop-thinking-activity-7293313766664904705-MPCK?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB7Ns74BpCd1C_AC6bPw9Wj2Vw5j6POGz9A

Jordan Cutler, senior software engineer at Pinterest and author of the High Growth Engineer newsletter (>80k subscribers), says:

Our expectations for each level of software engineer have changed.

If you were previously a junior engineer who needed handholding to start writing code, you could use AI to write code like a mid-level engineer.

Mid-level engineers can use AI to produce the output of a senior engineer. A senior engineer + AI = a Staff engineer, and so on and so forth.

1/ Know your audience: Who will read this? What do they already know? Tailor your writing to their needs.

2/ Clarify your core message: What am I trying to convey? Use short sentences. Avoid jargon when possible.

3/ Continuously edit your work: Your first draft is never perfect. I always read and tweak my writing multiple times.

4/ Seek feedback from senior folks: Reach out to senior engineers to review and give feedback. Their perspectives are valuable.

What’s the problem with this?

If you get lucky, you find the problem; but if you’re not lucky, you might spend the entire day chasing down dead ends.

And if you don’t finish the investigation quickly, you’ll likely 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗶𝗿𝗰𝗹𝗲𝘀 since you lose track of what you already looked into.

🎯 The solution: Break the problem into an issue tree that follows the MECE principle.

------------------------------------

Yeah, I also have framework fatigue. Too many acronyms to remember, and most of them are useless in the day-to-day. 

Last week, Jordan's and Torsten's article made me reconsider. 

I promise you, it's quite genius:
https://lnkd.in/dRgTyAJp

𝘐𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵, 𝘐'𝘮 𝘥𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭𝘺 𝘲𝘶𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 1 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘰𝘧 5 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦. 𝘈𝘭𝘭 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘑𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘢𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘛𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯!

------------------------------------

𝗠𝗘𝗖𝗘 = 𝗠utually 𝗘xclusive and 𝗖ollectively 𝗘xhaustive.

You break down the problem into non-overlapping segments, that cover 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. 

You start by dividing the possible root causes into high-level groups. Then, you break these groups down further, ensuring every possibility is captured and none of the buckets overlap.

✅ After: “There are 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 for what could be happening: Either something is broken, or the data only makes it look like there’s a problem. If something’s broken, it could be isolated to a specific OS, or affect all devices. And the issue could be at any of the three steps of the signup process, so we’ll check them one by one.”

Don’t rely on luck to find the root cause. The MECE framework gives you a structure that ensures you will find it, and makes it easy to:

1. get everyone on the same page on what’s being investigated.
2. divide the work between different people or teams.

Another benefit of using this structure is that since you have an overview of all possible things you need to check, you can prioritize what to investigate first.

For example, you can see that checking for a data issue or seasonality first can potentially save you a lengthy investigation.

------------------------------------

In the article, Jordan and Torsten also covered:
1. Acing interviews 
2. Giving investigation updates
3. Explaining something to your colleagues
4. Deciding what to work on",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anton-zaides_imagine-you-are-checking-some-dashboards-activity-7268270012350570496-ywhf?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD81P2gB8COKVZLp6EQQjDG5lu3X4UjKxEQ

They obsess over APIs and forget the real problem: coupling and reliability.

In my latest video, I break down how microservices should actually talk to each other. You’ll see where synchronous (HTTP, gRPC) calls make sense, and where you should switch to asynchronous messaging with queues and topics.

I also cover real .NET examples with Azure Service Bus, Redis, and distributed tracing, so you can see how to design communication that’s fast, reliable, and easy to reason about.

In software development, architecture plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and behavior of software systems. It provides a blueprint for system design, detailing how components interact with each other to deliver specific functionality. They also offer solutions to common problems, saving time and effort and leading to more robust and maintainable systems.

However, with the vast array of architectural styles and patterns available, it can take time to discern which approach best suits a particular project or system. Aims to shed light on these concepts, helping you make informed decisions in your architectural endeavors.

To help you navigate the vast landscape of architectural styles and patterns, there is a cheat sheet that encapsulates all. This cheat sheet is a handy reference guide that you can use to quickly recall the main characteristics of each architectural style and pattern.

I was at Cloudfest for work, and although I could have scheduled all my LinkedIn posts over the previous weekend, I preferred to take a week off to spend time with family, whom I wouldn't see for a week.

As someone who has always promoted consistency and who has regularly posted five times a week for months, you start to:

🔄 Feel that you're breaking your consistency habit.

🐢 Worry that others will progress faster since you're taking a pause.

🚧 Fear that what you've built will be disrupted.

This is what they call FOMO - the Fear of Missing Out.

But building consistency doesn't mean overdoing it to the point of burnout.

As I've often said, it takes time to build consistency and habits, but fortunately, it takes much more than a week of ""rest"" to disrupt them.

Taking a break is sometimes just a part of your journey towards consistency and it offers multiple benefits:

💭 It gives you time to reflect on your journey towards consistency.

🧠 It allows your brain to refresh and generate new ideas.

🔥 It helps prevent burnout, which could set you back much more than a week.

So, even if you're on your journey to consistency, don't let FOMO guide you. Have a clear path to your goals and make pauses part of it.

But what happens when your table hits 10 million rows and that ""magic"" disappears?

 🚀 I call it MAG, which stands for Minimum Achievable Goal.


1️⃣ I wake up every morning, and I lie in bed for 10 minutes listing all my goals for the day. They are usually a lot and very ambitious.

I wish I could achieve all of them, but I know I can't.

2️⃣ While walking back from taking my daughter to kindergarten, I begin reviewing all these goals and I cut down what isn't a priority, until I'm left with three main goals for the day.

But that's not enough.

3️⃣ As soon as I'm back home, I start my journaling session; this is where I set my main goal for the day.

Just one.

This unique goal is what I absolutely have to achieve during the day.

Does this mean I'll work on just one task per day? 

Obviously not.

But focusing on just one main task when you tend to procrastinate has multiple benefits:

😔 Procrastinating feels bad. Having just one goal to achieve increases chances to feel successful during the day.

🔥 As soon as you find yourself procrastinating, you immediately know where to switch your focus instead of thinking about all your goals.

🔋 Achieving just one goal is easier, and when you do, you'll get energized by this, ending up wanting to achieve more goals.

And you? How do you fight procrastination?

🚀 Side projects.

Working on a side project offers numerous benefits:

📚 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
↳ from diving into new technologies to refining existing skills.

🥱 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗕𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗼𝗺

🏦 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
↳ build something that opens future career paths or opportunities.

However, without proper management, side projects can present challenges, including:

⏳ Time Management
🥊 Potential Conflicts with Your Current Employer
🤝 Misunderstandings with Colleagues or People you Lead
👀 Public Exposure
📉 Financial Risk
💤 Burnout

Here's the framework I use when I want to start a new side project:

- Understand the Why
- Time Allocation
- Choose the Right Project
- Set SMART Goals
- Select Tools Wisely

If you're considering starting your next side project and aim to maximize its benefits for your engineering career, today might just be your lucky day, as I've shared insights on this in The Hybrid Hacker newsletter 🤓

⚖️ Taking decisions. 

Think about it. Every action we take involves some level of decision-making, and making decisions for ourselves can sometimes be challenging.

Now, imagine the complexities of decision-making within an engineering team, where multiple individuals, possibly from diverse cultures and backgrounds, are involved.

I wish I could offer you a secret recipe for making decisions in this context, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t exist (believe me, I’ve searched for it for 10 years).

However, having robust decision-making processes within your engineering team is crucial. 

Here are the benefits:

🔥 Focuses effort
🔄 Ensures consistency
⏳ Saves time
🧭 Provides direction
🛡️ Builds resilience

So, how do you make decisions? 

There are many different approaches, including:

🪖 Autocratic
🧠 Experiential
🚀 Empowered Autonomy
📊 Data-Driven
🗳️ Majority Rule
✅ Consensus

Choosing your approach depends on various factors, such as:

- Your role and leadership style
- Your risk aversion
- Your relationship with stakeholders
- Your team's culture
- Your company's environment
- The specific nature of the decisions to be made

And particularly, the area in which you must make those decisions.

Yes, it’s a lot to digest, but you’re lucky. 

As I do every Thursday, I’ve simplified a complex topic like decision-making in Engineering Teams and shared the insights with 22.1K+ people who already subscribed to The Hybrid Hacker newsletter.

You can use it to extend your authorization logic by adding dynamic claims at runtime.

If your Identity Provider's access token doesn't perfectly align with your application's internal authorization needs, you can use claims transformation.

Claims transformation allows you to modify the claims before the application uses them for authorization.

You can use this to fill in the missing claims from your database or another source.

Here's why this is helpful: https://lnkd.in/eMsd69UY

Before containers simplified deployment, virtualization changed how we used hardware. Both isolate workloads, but they do it differently.

- Virtualization (Hardware-level isolation): Each virtual machine runs a complete operating system, Windows, Fedora, or Ubuntu, with its own kernel, drivers, and libraries. The hypervisor (VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, KVM) sits directly on hardware and emulates physical machines for each guest OS. 

This makes VMs heavy but isolated. Need Windows and Linux on the same box? VMs handle it easily. Startup time for a typical VM is in minutes because you're booting an entire operating system from scratch.

- Containerization (OS-level isolation): Containers share the host operating system's kernel. No separate OS per container. Just isolated processes with their own filesystem and dependencies.

The container engine (Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman) manages lifecycle, networking, and isolation, but it all runs on top of a single shared kernel. Lightweight and fast. Containers start in milliseconds because you're not booting an OS, just launching a process.

But here's the catch: all containers on a host must be compatible with that host's kernel. Can't run Windows containers on a Linux host (without nested virtualization tricks).

Over to you: What's your go-to setup: containers in VMs, bare metal containers, or something else?

Polly is probably your first choice.

And Polly is much faster in V8+.

But why should you care about making your application resilient?

Let's say your services communicate by sending HTTP requests.

HTTP requests can fail because of network or server issues.

These failures can disrupt service availability, especially as dependencies increase. This increases the risk of cascading failures.

Luckily, there's a simple way to solve this in your .NET applications.

Here's how you can make your apps resilient: https://lnkd.in/e39__DXH

Do you use Polly in your applications?

There's also an official resilience library in .NET.

But it's a wrapper around Polly that adds OpenTelemetry on top.

💡 Lead both with head and heart, instead.

This imho falls under the concept of 'Emotional Intelligence', which involves the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as the capacity to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.

But how do you achieve that?

🤔 Self-Awareness: recognize your feelings and their impact on those around you. It involves being honest with yourself and having confidence in who you are.

🌀 Self-Regulation: understand your emotions and think before reacting. Adapt to changes without losing control.

💞 Compassion: understand the feelings of others, treat them with care, without becoming emotionally involved in their experiences.

🤝 Develop Social Skills: build positive relationships and guide people effectively. Communicate transparently, resolve conflicts, and connect with others.

Curious to hear about how you work on developing your Emotional Intelligence, let me know in the comments 🙂👇

Visual inspired by Roberto Ferraro 🙂

282,Nicola Ballotta,0.96,208,108,323,Teacher,Personal Growth,Personal Experience,List Post,"Yesterday, I achieved a significant milestone much sooner than I ever expected.","Yesterday, I achieved a significant milestone much sooner than I ever expected.

In just ab","Yesterday, I achieved a significant milestone much sooner than I ever expected.

🚀 20,000 subscribers to my newsletter, The Hybrid Hacker.

In just about 13 months. Back in November, I was at 9k, which means I nearly doubled my subscriber count in the last three months.

These numbers are all relative. I know of people who grew much faster, and others slower. As I often say, statistics only give you a perception of growth.

What truly confirms my growth is:

📚 The amount I've learned from writing
↳ Writing not only enhanced my consistency but also significantly broadened my knowledge, including a big improvement in my English.

👥 The number of people I've connected with during this period.
↳ Despite being an introvert and often hesitant about networking, I met 100+ great people in the last year, some of whom I've developed genuine relationships with.

🙏 People who reached out to thank me for my writing.
↳ Here on LinkedIn alone, I have an endless backlog of DMs awaiting my response (I promise to reply to all, as always!). These messages range from thanks and support requests to simple greetings.

💖 And, of course, those who chose to support me with a paid subscription.
↳ Currently, I have 111 paid subscribers. While this isn't a business for me (I have my full-time job), the income helps me purchase tools, newsletter subscriptions, courses, etc., to enhance my content quality. It's also incredibly rewarding to see people willing to pay for what I create.

Considering these four ""KPIs"", I can confidently say my growth was exponential.

So, how did I achieve these numbers?

Two factors were key:

- Consistency
- People

The latter was crucial, and there's an endless list of people I need to thank. I'm sure I'll forget someone; they are simply too many:

For being a great inspiration and supporting me from the start of my journey:
- 🌀 Luca Rossi
- Jordan Cutler
- Gregor Ojstersek
- Omar Halabieh
- Irina Stanescu
- Caleb Mellas
- Anemari Fiser
- Ryan Peterman
- Raviraj Achar
- Richard Donovan
- Luca Sartoni
- Roberto Ferraro
- Janis Ozolins
- Anton Zaides

For becoming part of my network and helping me grow over the past months:
- Neo Kim

Apache dominated web servers for 20 years, then Nginx showed up and changed everything. Now Nginx powers some of the largest sites on the internet, including Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox, and WordPress. com. Not because it's newer or trendier, but because it solves problems that Apache couldn't handle efficiently. 

Here’s what makes Nginx so popular:

- High-Performance Web Server
- Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer
- Caching Layer
- SSL Termination (Offloading)

Over to you: What’s your primary use for Nginx today, web server, reverse proxy, or load balancer?

HTTP has evolved from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, and now HTTP/3, which uses the QUIC protocol over UDP for improved performance. Today, it’s the backbone of almost everything on the internet, from browsers and APIs to streaming, cloud, and AI systems.

At the foundation, we have underlying protocols. TCP/IP for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. Unix domain sockets for local communication. HTTP/3 running over UDP instead of TCP. These handle the actual data transport before HTTP even comes into play.

Security wraps around everything. HTTPS isn't optional anymore. WebSockets power real-time connections. Web servers manage workloads. CDNs distribute content globally. DNS resolves everything to IPs. Proxies (forward, reverse, and API gateways) route, filter, and secure traffic in between.

Web services exchange data in different formats, REST with JSON, SOAP for enterprise systems, RPC for direct calls, and GraphQL for flexible queries. Crawlers and bots index the web, guided by robots.txt files that set the boundaries.

The network world connects everything. LANs, WANs, and protocols like FTP for file transfers, IMAP/POP3 for email, and BitTorrent for peer-to-peer communication. For observability, packet capture tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and OpenTelemetry let developers peek under the hood to understand performance, latency, and behavior across the stack.

Over to you: HTTP has been evolving for 30+ years, what do you think the next big shift will be?

We have two official NuGet packages:

- Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience
- Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience

They're built on top of Polly, so the API should be familiar. You can use them to define resilience policies in C#.

They extend Polly with some useful features. For example, a standard pipeline you can add to HttpClients. There's also an OpenTelemetry integration.

A few strategies that are available out of the box:

- Retries
- Timeouts
- Fallbacks
- Circuit breakers

But it's not a good solution for every situation. Here's why. 👇

Cursor pagination uses a reference point (cursor) to fetch the next page of results.

This reference point must be a unique identifier or a combination of fields that define the sort order.

My tests showed cursor pagination was 17x faster compared to offset pagination.

So why don't we always use it?

Cursor pagination works particularly well for real-time feeds and infinite scroll interfaces.

If most users start at the first page and rarely visit other pages, offset pagination might be sufficient. This will be the case for many applications.

And I made it 15x faster.

The endpoint did heavy calculations and pulled data from several services, so it didn’t scale.

My process was simple:

- Find the slowest code
- Fix the queries
- Cut external calls
- Add caching last

Measure everything. The slow parts were obvious:

- DB calls inside a loop
- Repeated external calls
- Duplicate calculations

Database round trips cost time, so avoid loops and batch what you can.

Independent service calls? Run them concurrently.

Still slow? Add caching with clear expiration rules (IMemoryCache / IDistributedCache).

For distributed systems, OpenTelemetry makes the bottlenecks visible.

👉 Here’s how: https://lnkd.in/dsxuMvmz

What would you do differently?

EF Core is fast, but only if you use the right tools.

Here are 5 features that will speed up your data access:

1. Query Splitting: Stops ""Cartesian Explosion"" by breaking huge JOINs into separate SQL queries.

2. Bulk Updates: ExecuteUpdate() modifies rows directly in the DB. Zero memory allocation.

3. Bulk Deletes: ExecuteDelete() wipes data instantly without fetching it first.

4. Raw SQL: Sometimes LINQ generates bad SQL. Raw SQL lets you take the wheel for complex queries.

5. IgnoreQueryFilters: Perfect for Admin dashboards where you need to see ""Soft Deleted"" data or tenant-specific records.

Bonus: I covered 5 more advanced features in this article: https://lnkd.in/dxbAfjUR

Which one of these saved your production app?

You can't use a standard Database Transaction (ACID) because the data lives in different places.

You need a Saga.

And a Saga is essentially just a State Machine with memory.

It tracks the progress of a workflow:

1. Current State: ""OrderPlaced""
2. Event: ""PaymentReceived""
3. Transition: Move to ""OrderPaid"" state and send a command to the Shipping Service.

If something fails (e.g., ""ShippingFailed""), the State Machine triggers a specific ""Compensating Action"" to undo the previous steps (e.g., Issue Refund).

It turns chaos into a deterministic workflow.

You can see a full code example of an Order Saga here: https://lnkd.in/d6jY3KaP

Sagas are complex at first, but they are a lifesaver for data consistency.

And years ago, I was one of them.

The scenario was simple:
A user clicks “Generate Report.”
The API takes 5 minutes to finish.
What do you change?

Back then, I tried to “optimize” the slow part... faster queries, better hardware, parallelization.
None of that solved the real problem.

The issue wasn’t performance.
It was the architecture.

Here’s what I learned:

• Don’t run long tasks in an HTTP request
• Use a queue and a background worker
• Return 202 Accepted instead of blocking
• Store the final file in object storage
• Notify the user when the work is done (SignalR / email / polling)

This simple question changed how I think about system design.
It taught me to design workflows, not endpoints.

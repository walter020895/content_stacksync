In 2011, integrating payments into your app took weeks.

PayPal documentation. XML everywhere. Redirect users off your site. 
Back and forth with support. Up to 60 days to access your own funds.

Stripe launched with 7 lines of JavaScript.

PayPal had brand recognition. 
Trust. Market share. 
They were processing over $100 billion a year.

But they built for finance teams.

Stripe built for developers.

Patrick Collison understood something: developers choose the tools. 
They influence architecture decisions. 

They're the ones implementing the integration at 2am before launch.

Make the developer's life easier. 
They'll make your product successful.

2024: Stripe hit $70B valuation. 
Processing over $1 trillion annually.

The companies that win aren't building for the people who approve the budget.

They're building for the people who actually use the product.

there are two types of engineers. Builders and maintainers. 
the gap between them has nothing to do with talent:

it has everything to do with what they spend their time on.

most engineers learned to code because they wanted to build something. 
ship products. solve hard problems. create things that didn't exist before.

then they join a company, and 30-40% of their week disappears into integration maintenance. 

mapping custom fields, handling rate limits and debugging sync failures

I see this constantly. Smart engineers turning into expensive API babysitters

at Stacksync we ask ourselves one question every ten minutes: what am I working on right now, and is it the highest-impact thing I could be doing?

most integration maintenance fails that test. 

the difference between a team that ships fast and a team that drowns in technical debt has nothing to do with talent. 

It comes down to how much of that talent goes toward the actual product versus the pipes connecting it to other systems.

Your best engineers should be building the thing your customers pay for. 

Not maintaining connections between systems that should just work.

builders or maintainers. 

wich one best describes your team?

The biggest lesson of my career didn't come from a win. 
It came from watching someone brilliant fail.
I was working under a former Head of AI at Google:

Health tech startup. Super impactful. Every time I went to the clinic, I could see the difference we were making in people's lives.

My boss was extremely smart in tech.
But somehow he couldn't build a movement.

You know what I realized?

I understood that I was just executing.
And executing alone doesn't change anything.

What you need is to be good at something — and then inspire other people to go on a journey with you and do something unbelievable.

That's the difference.

The smartest person in the room stays in the room.
The one who builds a movement changes which room everyone's in.

I'm trying to do this at Stacksync every day.
Best people. Best energy. Same journey.

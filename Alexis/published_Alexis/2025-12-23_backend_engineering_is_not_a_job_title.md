Backend engineering is not a job title.
It's a way of thinking.

Every technical role uses it:

Data engineers think in backend. 
DevOps thinks in backend. 
MLOps thinks in backend. 
Platform engineers think in backend.

The difference is context, not skill.
Master the principles → pick any path.

This playlist its very good to do it 👇

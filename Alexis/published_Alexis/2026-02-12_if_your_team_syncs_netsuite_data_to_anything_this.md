If your team syncs NetSuite data to anything, this is what we replaced that workflow with.

The sync:
- Bidirectional. Data flows both ways between NetSuite and Postgres.
- Real-time. When a record changes, it syncs. Not batch. Not hourly.
- Custom fields and custom records included.

What changes for your team:
- Query NetSuite data with standard SQL
- Build reports and automations on live ERP data
- No middleware layer between your database and NetSuite
- No governance unit math. No concurrency headaches.

Who it's for:
- Teams running NetSuite + Salesforce that need data flowing between both
- Engineering teams maintaining custom sync scripts
- Finance and RevOps that need numbers to match across systems

If your team connects NetSuite to anything else, this is what we built.

Long live SQL.

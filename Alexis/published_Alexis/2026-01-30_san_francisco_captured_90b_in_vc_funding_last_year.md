San Francisco captured $90B in VC funding last year:


57% of all US venture capital.
76% of all US AI funding.
3.5x more than New York.
2x more than all of Europe.

The pandemic "SF is dead" narrative aged poorly.
The city's share of US VC in 2024 was the highest in eight years.

If you're here, you're already ahead.
Not because you're better. Because you're where the network is densest.

Here are some numbers:

👨‍💻49% of Big Tech engineers live here
🤖 35% of AI/ML engineers
🦄 268 unicorns headquartered in the Bay Area 
💰Seed rounds close in weeks, not months

That's why we believe in events.
Same principle. Compress the serendipity.

Feb 4th we're bringing NetSuite operators together. 
Fellow. Orderful. Real infrastructure people.

San Francisco. Fellow HQ.

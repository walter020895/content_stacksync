The best developer I ever worked with didn’t work at Google, Amazon or Meta When I met him, his “stack” looked like this:

A half-documented monolith, a cron job nobody understood, and a production bug that only appeared when three people checked out from Brazil at the same time.

No platform team.
No SRE.
No “we’ll open a ticket.”
If he didn’t fix it, payroll didn’t run.
Simple.

That’s the thing about outlier engineers:

At big companies, you’re protected by the system.
At small, messy ones, you are the system.

In big tech, you can spend two years optimizing 0.5% of a service you don’t really own.

In a 13-person company, you ship something today that either keeps the business alive or doesn’t.

You learn to:

Design systems without unlimited infra.

Debug with incomplete logs and zero “proper” observability.

Make architecture calls with just enough data and way too much risk.

You don’t get polish. You get scars. And those scars are where real judgment comes from.

So if you’re a CTO or tech lead hiring your next key dev:

Don’t just filter by logos and buzzwords.

Look for the people who’ve shipped under real constraints, owned the ugly parts of the system, and kept something fragile alive long enough to grow.

That’s where the outliers usually are.

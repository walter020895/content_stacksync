Who owns the CRM data pipeline?

Engineering: "That's Data's responsibility"
Data: "Engineering built it, they own it"
IT: "We just provision the servers"
DevOps: "We deploy it, we don't maintain it"
Analytics: "We just consume the data"

Who actually fixes it when it breaks at 3am?

The one engineer who happened to respond to the Slack notification first.
He just put in his two weeks.

Pipelines shouldn't need heroes. They should just work.
(Yes, this is what we solve at Stacksync.)

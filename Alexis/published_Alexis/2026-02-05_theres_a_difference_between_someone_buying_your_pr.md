There's a difference between someone buying your product and someone showing the room how they use it.

We hosted The SF NetSuite Series: From Silos to AI-Driven Ops.
45 NetSuite practitioners in one room. Good energy.

Fellow, Orderful, and Origami Precision on stage with us.

And then Arvind Jeyakumar from Fellow (a $100M+ specialty coffee company)
stood up and showed the room how they use Stacksync.

Their actual workflow. How they sync their NetSuite data with Stacksync in production.

That moment hit me.

I work with customers every day. But this was different.

This was someone choosing to stand in front of a room full of strangers and say: we use this. Let me show you why.

You can raise money. You can ship features. You can grow the team.

But the moment a customer talks about your product and shows it with pride, not because you asked, but because they want to?

That's something you can't build. You can only earn it.

Really happy about this 💙

Most engineers spend their careers 
becoming experts at someone else's API.


Salesforce documentation. 
NetSuite authentication flows. 
HubSpot pagination quirks.

That's not really building. That's maintenance.

I've watched talented engineers lose months to API plumbing. Learning rate limits. Handling batch endpoints. Debugging authentication failures at 2am.

The actual business problem? Maybe 20% of the work. 
The API interface? 80%.

This is backwards.

We built Stacksync to flip that ratio.

Your database table becomes a mirror of your CRM. 
You write SQL. The API calls happen automatically.

Authentication. Rate limiting. Pagination. Conflict resolution. All handled.

An INSERT creates a CRM record. An UPDATE modifies it. A JOIN queries relationships that would take five API calls to fetch.

You describe what you want. Stacksync handles how to get it.
This isn't about making APIs easier. It's about making APIs invisible.

Engineers should spend their time on problems that matter. Not on interfaces that don't.

We've processed over a million records per minute this way. 
The architecture scales. The complexity doesn't.

 That's the difference between building infrastructure and maintaining it.

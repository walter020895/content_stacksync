## RUBEN

**Option A — The customer call timeline**
> The 6-month mark is when they call us. By then the logs are useless anyway.

**Option B — What he hears**
> The one I keep hearing: customer gets a renewal email for a product they cancelled three weeks ago. That's not hallucination. That's a sync that ran on Monday.

**Option C — Confirming the stat**
> 42% is probably low. Most teams haven't even diagnosed it yet.

## NACHO

**Option A — Who had the answer**
> The data team had the answer two years ago. Nobody gave them the budget.

**Option B — Market timing**
> Everyone's racing to ship the agent. Nobody's racing to fix what it reads.

**Option C — Clean operator close**
> The customer always pays for this conversation.

## CARTER

**Option A — Seen both sides**
> I've heard both sides of this in the same meeting. Everyone's right. Nobody's fixing it.

**Option B — The line that hits**
> "We've been asking for budget to fix the sync for two years." That one line explains a lot of failed AI rollouts.

**Option C — Nobody looked**
> Everyone blamed the model. Nobody asked when the Salesforce export ran.

## BRITTANY

**Option A — The human layer**
> "The customer gets the worst of both." That line is the whole post.

**Option B — Warm observation**
> The AI team and the data team both fighting while the customer just wants their information to be right. That's the part nobody talks about.

**Option C — Foundation first**
> And y'all, this is why you fix what's underneath before you build on top of it.

3 AM.
Slack alert: "API rate limit exceeded. Sync failed."

You know what comes next.

Roll out of bed. Open laptop. Check which batch job hit the limit this time. Manually restart. Hope it doesn't happen again in 2 hours.

Our clients had this exact night more times than I can count.

The worst part? It's not even their fault.

They did everything right:
- Implemented exponential backoff
- Batched requests efficiently
- Scheduled jobs during off-peak hours

But Salesforce doesn't care. HubSpot doesn't care. 
The rate limit exists to protect their infrastructure, not yours.

So you set your alarm. You build monitoring. You create runbooks for failures that shouldn't happen.

You become an integration babysitter instead of an engineer.

This is what we refused to accept when building Stacksync.

Our architecture doesn't hammer APIs with batch requests. 

It listens for changes and syncs events, not bulk queries. We've processed millions of records for customers without hitting a single rate limit.

No 3 AM alerts. No manual restarts. No babysitting.

If you're waking up to rate limit errors, you're not the problem.

Your integration architecture is.

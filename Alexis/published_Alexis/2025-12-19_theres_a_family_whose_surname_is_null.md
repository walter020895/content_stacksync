There's a family whose surname is Null.
They can't book flights online. Forms think they left the field blank.

Bank of America blocked one of their emails for years.

American Express just deletes their last name from mail.

A guy got a NULL vanity plate and received $12k in traffic tickets, every blank plate field in California matched to him.

Christopher Null wrote about it in Wired in 2015. 
Jennifer Null made the BBC in 2016. 
The license plate guy presented at DEF CON in 2019.

Hoare called null his billion-dollar mistake. In 1965.

60 years later, we're still shipping it.

Maybe AI will finally fix this. Or maybe it'll just autocomplete if (name == "NULL") faster. 😅

Heroku Enterprise sales ended (February 5, 2026)
Salesforce just killed it.

Heroku is now in "maintenance mode" — no new features, just keeping the lights on.

If you're on Heroku Connect and need to migrate, here's what to know:

- Your existing contract is honored (for now)
- But no new features are coming
- Time to evaluate alternatives

Stacksync does everything Heroku Connect does + more:

✅ True bi-directional sync (not just polling)
✅ Millisecond latency (not 5-minute intervals)
✅ Works with Salesforce, HubSpot, and 200+ connectors
✅ SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR certified

<!-- Original Alexis post: True -->

The engineers who will thrive with AI tools aren't the fastest prompters.
They're the ones who know when to stop.

I tell my team: every 10 minutes, pause for 10 seconds.

Ask:
- What am I doing?
- Why?
- Is this still the right path?

AI can generate code in seconds. But it can't tell you if you're solving the wrong problem.

The 10-minute rule isn't about slowing down. It's about not wasting speed on the wrong direction.

Flow state feels productive. But flow without checkpoints is just expensive motion.

The skill that will matter most isn't coding faster. It's knowing when to stop and redirect

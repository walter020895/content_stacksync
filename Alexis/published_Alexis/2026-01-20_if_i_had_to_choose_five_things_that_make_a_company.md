If I had to choose five things that make a company successful: 
Details would be number one. 

Not strategy. Not funding. Not even talent.

Details.

Because we live in a world full of garbage. Everything that's just "okay" is noise competing with other noise.

The only way to stand out is to be obsessively intentional.

Sloppy work in small things compounds into sloppy work in big things.
And then you're just another company shipping mediocre stuff that nobody remembers.

The standard isn't "good enough."
The standard is: would I bet my reputation on this detail?

If not, fix it.

Details aren't glamorous. 
Nobody posts about catching edge cases.

But that's exactly why they're a competitive advantage. 
Because most people skip them.

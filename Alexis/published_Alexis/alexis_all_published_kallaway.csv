Data engineers blame scientists for unrealistic requests.
And both teams are about to get replaced by AI.

At least that's the fear.
But here's what's actually happening:

LLMs integrated with semantic layers hit near-perfect accuracy.
LLMs without them? Around 80% hallucination rates.

Same models. 
Same prompts. 
Wildly different results.

The difference isn't the AI. 
It's the infrastructure underneath it.

And that infrastructure? 
It's built by data engineers and shaped by data scientists.

The problem is they're still working in silos.
60% of organizations cite data quality as their top priority. 
Yet most data teams operate like this:

→ Engineers process data without considering ML requirements → Scientists write Python that doesn't translate to production → Nobody owns the schema. 

Everyone owns the blame.

The ""thinker/doer"" dynamic is killing teams. 

Engineers just industrialize whatever scientists build. 
No real collaboration. Just handoffs and finger-pointing.

Meanwhile, AI is exposing every gap.
Bad data quality? The LLM hallucinates.
Schema drift? The model breaks.
No semantic layer? Good luck getting accurate answers.

Data contracts. Shared tooling. Scientists involved early, not treated as downstream consumers.

85% of firms say lakehouses accelerated their AI readiness.
Because it finally put both teams in the same architecture.

AI doesn't replace data teams.
It exposes the dysfunctional ones.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/favre-alexis_data-scientists-blame-data-engineers-for-activity-7403917248853069824-hdl9?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADq6p-kBcdJAYJMzAN8VuZZFUmNBfOSttAI,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFU2dXF-ZBWtA/feedshare-shrink_20/B4EZr__gYbHUAM-/0/1765231429462?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=Yk-XRMFFJ36zJL4aIgrnaWn_e4dD1Qm-3h-aFpbSg7U,True,,

It came from watching someone brilliant fail.
I was working under a former Head of AI at Google:

Health tech startup. Super impactful. Every time I went to the clinic, I could see the difference we were making in people's lives.

My boss was extremely smart in tech.
But somehow he couldn't build a movement.

You know what I realized?

I understood that I was just executing.
And executing alone doesn't change anything.

What you need is to be good at something — and then inspire other people to go on a journey with you and do something unbelievable.

That's the difference.

The smartest person in the room stays in the room.
The one who builds a movement changes which room everyone's in.

I'm trying to do this at Stacksync every day.

In a 13-person company, you ship something today that either keeps the business alive or doesn’t.

You learn to:

Design systems without unlimited infra.

Debug with incomplete logs and zero “proper” observability.

Make architecture calls with just enough data and way too much risk.

You don’t get polish. You get scars. And those scars are where real judgment comes from.

So if you’re a CTO or tech lead hiring your next key dev:

Don’t just filter by logos and buzzwords.

Look for the people who’ve shipped under real constraints, owned the ugly parts of the system, and kept something fragile alive long enough to grow.

At OpenAI scale, the question was different:

“How do we make Kafka less central?”

Kafka stopped being the front door

Producers no longer talked to brokers directly
A proxy layer absorbed retries, spikes, and bad client behavior
Kafka became the durable backbone and not the place where chaos lands

The result (publicly reported):

 – ~20× higher throughput
 – Five-nines availability
 – Regions that fail without taking each other down

Why it worked:

 – Brokers stopped handling unbounded client behavior
 – Backpressure was intentional instead of emergent
 – Failure handling moved out of the core

The lesson:
If something is both critical and central, it will cap your scale.

Don’t just scale the component.
Move the blast radius.

And be honest about the cost: more moving parts, new failure modes, and more operational work.

The 10-minute rule isn't about slowing down. It's about not wasting speed on the wrong direction.

Flow state feels productive. But flow without checkpoints is just expensive motion.

45 lines of code became 4. The industry is still catching up to what they built.

""Normal"" Salesforce integration looks like this: learn the REST API. Handle OAuth. Build pagination. Hit rate limits. Build retry logic. Parse nested JSON. Deploy. Maintain forever.

30-50% of engineering time goes to this.

The Heroku Connect team saw this problem clearly. They built something different: replicate Salesforce into Postgres. Query with SQL. Write with SQL. Forget the API exists.

The difference?
Complex join across three Salesforce objects via API: 45+ lines, three paginated requests. 

Same query in SQL against a synced table: 4 lines.

Zero rate limits. Zero token management. Sub-millisecond reads.

The insight was architectural: as long as CRM data lives behind an HTTP API, you can't query it freely. Rate limits throttle you. Latency punishes you.

Put that data in Postgres? Full SQL. Your ORM works. Your BI tools work. Your developer writes SELECT statements instead of learning SOQL.

That's the difference between building your product and maintaining someone else's API.

But last week, Salesforce ended new Heroku Enterprise sales. 
Heroku Connect included.

The product had problems: polling-based, expensive, locked to Heroku Postgres. But the team that built it understood something the rest of the industry is only now figuring out.

Database-first. SQL-first. API-invisible.
They were ahead of their time. They deserved more.

Every company building Salesforce-to-Postgres sync now builds on what that team started. Including us at Stacksync.

Here's what's actually happening from a technical standpoint: 

The Apps SDK is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — an open standard that, ironically, Anthropic created. 

Your app responds to natural language triggers, can render interactive UI components directly in the chat, and gets access to conversational context when users invoke it.

The distribution: 800 million weekly active users, and your app can be triggered mid-conversation via @mention or suggested contextually by ChatGPT itself. 

That's fundamentally different from competing for attention in a traditional app store where users have to go looking.

But let's be precise about what this actually is right now:

The SDK is in beta. Every submission goes through a review process. 

The first batch of approved third-party apps won't hit users until early 2026. 

And monetization? Currently you can only link out to your own site or native app for transactions, no digital goods, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases yet. 

OpenAI says they're ""exploring"" options including something called the Agentic Commerce Protocol, but nothing's shipped.

Also worth noting: the entire platform is currently geo-blocked in the EU, Switzerland, and the UK.

So is this an opportunity? Probably yes. 

The technical primitives are interesting, you're building for a conversational interface where users describe intent in natural language rather than navigating UI. 

If you've been thinking about agentic workflows or conversational commerce, the infrastructure is finally being built.

It's on your org chart.

I've seen teams spin up ""free"" open-source Kafka expecting to save money.
But here's what the TCO actually looks like:
$350K - $1.2M+ per year.
And most of it isn't infrastructure.

Let me break it down:

Networking:
Networking eats 50-90% of your Kafka infrastructure costs.
Why? Cross-AZ traffic.

67% of producer writes hit remote zones
67% of consumer reads hit remote zones
Every replica syncs across zones

At 100/300 MB/s ingress/egress?
That's ~$9,330/month in networking alone.
Just moving bytes.

Humans
Minimum viable Kafka team: 2 engineers.
Fully-loaded cost: $350K-$392K/year.
But that's just to keep the lights on.
At Lyft-scale? 7-10 engineers.
That's $980K-$1.4M in salaries. Before benefits.

Ecosystem
Kafka alone isn't production-ready. You'll need:

Schema Registry (90%+ adoption)
Kafka Connect clusters (90%+ adoption)
GUI monitoring (90%+ adoption)
Stream processing (80-90%)
Geo-replication (80-90%)

Building this in-house?
20,000+ engineering hours.
6-12 months before you ship anything useful.

Nobody budgets for these:
- Over-provisioning (clusters run at 20-25% CPU utilization)
- Downtime costs ($87K/year at just 99% uptime)
- Load balancers, NAT gateways, K8s overhead (+25% to total cost)
- The one engineer who actually understands your configs

Before you kubectl apply that Helm chart:
1/ Calculate the 3-year TCO (not just infra. Include headcount)
2/ Price out managed alternatives honestly
3/ Ask: ""Is Kafka ops our core competency?""

Month-end close: big data migration and marketing just uploaded 50,000 contacts.

Then: HTTP 429.

You Google the error. The advice? 

""Implement exponential backoff.""

Translation: make your integration slower.

But the whole point of connecting systems is to move data fast. 

Slowing down isn't a solution. It's a band-aid on an architectural problem.

The real issue: most integrations poll APIs. 

They ask ""what changed?"" over and over. 

When you ask too often, you get throttled.

Stacksync - Integration Cloud works differently.

After losing $35 million to fraud at Peregrine.

His insight after 13 years building IT asset management: Everyone was building ticketing systems. Nobody was building workflow engines.

The difference:

Ticketing system:
•Capture request
•Assign to agent
•Track to resolution
•Report on tickets

Workflow engine:
•Model any business process
•Automate approvals and routing
•Connect to any system
•Extend to any department

ServiceNow's architecture decision: Build the workflow engine first. Ticketing is just one workflow.

Technical implications:

Metadata-driven configuration
Process designer (not code-first)
Integration framework (connect anything)
Extensible data model

The insight: IT help desk was the entry point, not the product.

43x customer expansion (from $100K to $4.3M over 15 years). 
Because the workflow engine could do more. And more. And more.

IT → HR → Customer Service → Finance.

the gap between them has nothing to do with talent:

it has everything to do with what they spend their time on.

most engineers learned to code because they wanted to build something. 
ship products. solve hard problems. create things that didn't exist before.

then they join a company, and 30-40% of their week disappears into integration maintenance. 

mapping custom fields, handling rate limits and debugging sync failures

I see this constantly. Smart engineers turning into expensive API babysitters

at Stacksync we ask ourselves one question every ten minutes: what am I working on right now, and is it the highest-impact thing I could be doing?

most integration maintenance fails that test. 

the difference between a team that ships fast and a team that drowns in technical debt has nothing to do with talent. 

It comes down to how much of that talent goes toward the actual product versus the pipes connecting it to other systems.

Your best engineers should be building the thing your customers pay for. 

Not maintaining connections between systems that should just work.

Salesforce documentation. 
NetSuite authentication flows. 
HubSpot pagination quirks.

That's not really building. That's maintenance.

I've watched talented engineers lose months to API plumbing. Learning rate limits. Handling batch endpoints. Debugging authentication failures at 2am.

The actual business problem? Maybe 20% of the work. 
The API interface? 80%.

This is backwards.

We built Stacksync to flip that ratio.

Your database table becomes a mirror of your CRM. 
You write SQL. The API calls happen automatically.

Authentication. Rate limiting. Pagination. Conflict resolution. All handled.

An INSERT creates a CRM record. An UPDATE modifies it. A JOIN queries relationships that would take five API calls to fetch.

You describe what you want. Stacksync handles how to get it.
This isn't about making APIs easier. It's about making APIs invisible.

Engineers should spend their time on problems that matter. Not on interfaces that don't.

We've processed over a million records per minute this way. 
The architecture scales. The complexity doesn't.

Forever. 
For up to 2 users and 1,000 contacts.

This isn't charity. It's architecture.

The technical strategy: CRM is the data foundation. 
Everything else (Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub) layers on top.

What the free CRM creates:

• Contact database (unified identity)
• Company records (account hierarchy)
• Deal tracking (revenue pipeline)
• Activity timeline (engagement history)

Why this is technically genius: When you upgrade to any paid hub, your data is already structured. No import. No mapping. No migration.

The CRM is the schema. 
The hubs are the features.

This explains HubSpot's expansion revenue: 
Start with free CRM. 
• Add Marketing Hub (your contacts are already there). 
• Add Sales Hub (your deals are already tracked). 
• Add Service Hub (your customers are already known).

(Worth noting: HubSpot tightened the free tier in late 2024. It used to be 1 million contacts. Now it's 1,000. The on-ramp got smaller, but the architecture remains the same.)

The insight: Data structure should precede feature adoption. 

Give away the structure.

OpenAI just opened the ChatGPT App Directory for submissions 🧑🏻‍💻
Here's what's actually happening from a technical standpoint: 

The Apps SDK is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — an open standard that, ironically, Anthropic created. 

Your app responds to natural language triggers, can render interactive UI components directly in the chat, and gets access to conversational context when users invoke it.

The distribution: 800 million weekly active users, and your app can be triggered mid-conversation via @mention or suggested contextually by ChatGPT itself. 

That's fundamentally different from competing for attention in a traditional app store where users have to go looking.

But let's be precise about what this actually is right now:

The SDK is in beta. Every submission goes through a review process. 

The first batch of approved third-party apps won't hit users until early 2026. 

And monetization? Currently you can only link out to your own site or native app for transactions, no digital goods, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases yet. 

OpenAI says they're "exploring" options including something called the Agentic Commerce Protocol, but nothing's shipped.

Also worth noting: the entire platform is currently geo-blocked in the EU, Switzerland, and the UK.

So is this an opportunity? Probably yes. 

The technical primitives are interesting, you're building for a conversational interface where users describe intent in natural language rather than navigating UI. 

If you've been thinking about agentic workflows or conversational commerce, the infrastructure is finally being built.

Tell me what are you building

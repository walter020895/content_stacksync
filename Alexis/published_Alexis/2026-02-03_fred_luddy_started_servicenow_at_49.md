Fred Luddy started ServiceNow at 49. 
After losing $35 million to fraud at Peregrine.

His insight after 13 years building IT asset management: Everyone was building ticketing systems. Nobody was building workflow engines.

The difference:

Ticketing system:
•Capture request
•Assign to agent
•Track to resolution
•Report on tickets

Workflow engine:
•Model any business process
•Automate approvals and routing
•Connect to any system
•Extend to any department

ServiceNow's architecture decision: Build the workflow engine first. Ticketing is just one workflow.

Technical implications:

Metadata-driven configuration
Process designer (not code-first)
Integration framework (connect anything)
Extensible data model

The insight: IT help desk was the entry point, not the product.

43x customer expansion (from $100K to $4.3M over 15 years). 
Because the workflow engine could do more. And more. And more.

IT → HR → Customer Service → Finance. 
Same platform. Same architecture. New workflows.

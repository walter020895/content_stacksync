HubSpot's CRM is free. 
Forever. 
For up to 2 users and 1,000 contacts.

This isn't charity. It's architecture.

The technical strategy: CRM is the data foundation. 
Everything else (Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub) layers on top.

What the free CRM creates:

• Contact database (unified identity)
• Company records (account hierarchy)
• Deal tracking (revenue pipeline)
• Activity timeline (engagement history)

Why this is technically genius: When you upgrade to any paid hub, your data is already structured. No import. No mapping. No migration.

The CRM is the schema. 
The hubs are the features.

This explains HubSpot's expansion revenue: 
Start with free CRM. 
• Add Marketing Hub (your contacts are already there). 
• Add Sales Hub (your deals are already tracked). 
• Add Service Hub (your customers are already known).

(Worth noting: HubSpot tightened the free tier in late 2024. It used to be 1 million contacts. Now it's 1,000. The on-ramp got smaller, but the architecture remains the same.)

The insight: Data structure should precede feature adoption. 

Give away the structure. 
Charge for the capabilities.

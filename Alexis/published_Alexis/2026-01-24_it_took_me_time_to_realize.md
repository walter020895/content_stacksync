It took me time to realize:
Being a CTO is probably 80% orchestration.

And I'm not talking about roadmaps:

▶️ Knowing which engineer to put on which problem (right musician, right instrument)
▶️ Spotting when someone is rushing or dragging
▶️ Setting a tempo the whole team can follow
▶️ Creating the conditions where good work happens naturally
▶️ Removing friction before people hit it

I used to think leadership was about only inspiring people to join the journey.

I was wrong.

Inspiration fills the seats. Orchestration makes the music.

The best technical leaders I know aren't the smartest in the room. They're the ones who make everyone else 10x more effective.

You can't code your way to that
Just like you can't solo your way to a symphony

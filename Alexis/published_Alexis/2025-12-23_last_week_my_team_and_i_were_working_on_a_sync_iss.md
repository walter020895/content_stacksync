Last week, my team and I were working on a sync issue. 
We were tired, and stuck for an hour.

Then I remember: we had something similar before.

I search our docs. Find a page titled "Edge case: timestamp conflicts in bidirectional sync."

My face. My commit. My writing from April 2023.

I don't remember writing this.

Past-me left a note:

"If you're reading this, you're probably seeing phantom duplicates. This will take 10 minutes to fix, not the 4 hours you think."

Clear explanation. Code snippet. Warning about a misleading error.

Minutes later, done.

I sat there staring at the screen.

Tired-past-me, probably also at 11pm, took 15 extra minutes to write it down. Not for the team. Not for onboarding.

For this exact moment. :)

When you read your own docs from years ago, you meet a version of yourself you forgot existed. 

Sometimes they're smarter than you remember. 

I used to write docs for "the team."
Now I write for tired-future-me. 

The one who won't remember. The one who'll be grateful someone left a map.

The best documentation isn't comprehensive.
It's kind.

Has this ever happened to you, finding a doc you wrote and forgot?

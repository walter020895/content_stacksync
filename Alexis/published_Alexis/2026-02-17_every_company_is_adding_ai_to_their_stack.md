Every company is adding AI to their stack.
Almost none of them are ready for it.

Only 6% of AI leaders say their data infrastructure can actually support it (CData, 2026). Six percent.

And yet, the default move when AI outputs garbage? Swap the model. Tune the prompt. Add guardrails on top of guardrails.

Nobody asks: what data is this thing eating?

I see this pattern constantly. A team spends months building an AI feature. The demo works. Production is a disaster. Hallucinations everywhere. Leadership blames the model.

But the model was fine. The data was stale, duplicated, or just wrong.

71% of AI teams spend more than 25% of their time connecting systems, preparing data, fixing pipelines (IT Brief, 2025). That's your best engineers doing plumbing instead of building. And still the data that reaches the model is unreliable.

This is where details matter, you know? Everyone wants to talk about which LLM to pick. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, whatever. Nobody wants to talk about the fact that their Salesforce data hits the warehouse 6 hours late, half the fields are stale, and the pipeline breaks every time someone adds a custom object.

AI doesn't expose weak data pipelines. It amplifies them.

That's exactly why we built Stacksync the way we did. Real-time sync. Bi-directional. Your AI layer gets data that actually reflects reality, not yesterday's snapshot.

Gartner says 60% of AI projects will be abandoned due to data issues through 2026. Sixty percent.

The companies that win with AI won't be the ones with the best models. They'll be the ones who fixed the boring layer underneath. The infrastructure. The details.

Everyone else is just building a hallucination factory and calling it innovation.

Data engineering job interview: "you'll architect our real-time analytics platform" 
data engineering actual job: 

- debugging why the salesforce sync dropped 47,000 records at 3am 
- explaining to the ceo why the dashboard numbers don't match 
- writing the same "upsert" logic for the 15th time 
- pretending "eventual consistency" was intentional 
- mass mass snowflake costs while crying

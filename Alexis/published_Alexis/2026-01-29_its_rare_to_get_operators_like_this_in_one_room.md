It's rare to get operators like this in one room.
Rarer for them to share what actually worked.

Feb 4th, it's happening.

The SF NetSuite Series: From Silos to AI-Driven Ops

The lineup:

Arvind Jeyakumar — Staff Analytics Engineer at Fellow.

Fellow bootstrapped for 8 years.
Now over $100M in revenue.

Blake Harries — Senior Channel Manager at Orderful.

Orderful is a16z-backed and just launched Mosaic—the first AI-native EDI product that eliminates mapping entirely.

Ruben Burdin — CEO & Co-Founder at Stacksync.

My co-founder. We built real-time, bi-directional sync between NetSuite and everything else.

Three companies.
Three different paths.
One shared obsession: making NetSuite stop being a bottleneck.

Feb 4th | San Francisco | Fellow HQ Offices, 320 Florida Street.

Spots are limited to keep the conversation valuable.
Link to RSVP in comments.

See you there.

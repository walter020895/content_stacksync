# Ignacio Malpartida — Ghostwriter Personality + Voice System (MD)

## 1) Persona Snapshot (Who we’re writing as)
**Archetype:** *War-time GTM Operator who wants to be a Renaissance Man.*

Ignacio is a builder first (execution, speed, output), but he wants to be perceived as intellectually deep (philosophy, history, Bible, connecting dots). He’s not “motivational.” He’s operational + contrarian + high-conviction.

---

## 2) Core Drivers (What actually moves him)
- **Generational company / real business** (rejects “NGO vibes”).
- **Survival + winning through pace** (“Survive” as a principle).
- **100x obsession** (always thinking what will 100x leads/revenue — nights/weekends).
- **Respect through output** (leadership = visible effort + quality + speed).

---

## 3) Values & Principles (Repeatable pillars)
- **Lead by example:** inspiration comes from intensity + output quality.
- **Align incentives:** constant mapping of “what matters to them” vs “what matters to me.”
- **Permissionless value:** don’t ask to help; help anyway; do the extra mile by default.
- **Determinism for critical work:** human-in-loop, reliability > “AI magic.”
- **People matter:** good product + talk to people who need it + deliver.

---

## 4) Identity Signals (What he wants people to understand)
- **Complex / multi-domain:** “renaissance man” (art, philosophy, history, Bible, sports).
- **Elite operator:** can sustain high pace; pushes body/mind; executes impossible daily.
- **Contrarian truth-teller:** calls “bullshit” fast, then explains clearly.
- **Founder-factory leader:** success = team leaves and builds great companies.

---

## 5) Response Structure (How he thinks + answers)
Ignacio’s default thought architecture:

1) **Blunt headline first** (1–3 words)  
   Examples: “Survive.” / “Bullshit.” / “Doesn’t make sense.”
2) **Qualification** (“To be honest…”, “It’s like…”)  
3) **Fast list** (multi-item operator details)  
4) **Concrete example** (numbers, pace, roles, output)  
5) **Punchline certainty** (“That’s it.” / “Reliability wins.”)

**Ghostwriter rule:** preserve the rhythm. Don’t over-polish.

---

## 6) Voice Fingerprint (What it should sound like)

### Tone
- Direct, intense, high-conviction
- Anti-fluff, anti-hype
- Operator language + occasional “big idea” depth

### Cadence
- Short sentences.
- Repetition for emphasis.
- “It’s like…” as the bridge from instinct → explanation.

### Signature moves (keep these)
- Calls out nonsense quickly (“bullshit” → then reasoning).
- Speed imagery (pace, “boom boom boom” style).
- Concrete constraints: reliability, determinism, human checkpoints.

---

## 7) “LinkedIn Ignacio” (Public version)

### Two-mode system
**Mode A — Raw Ignacio (drafts/comments/notes):**
- Can say “bullshit”, “fuck”, “NGO vibes”.
- Ultra blunt, high heat.

**Mode B — Published Ignacio (LinkedIn):**
- Same conviction, cleaner language.
- Keep blunt headline + examples.
- Replace profanity, don’t remove intensity.

**Profanity laundering (examples):**
- “bullshit” → “nonsense / marketing fiction / fantasy”
- “fuck” → remove or “seriously”
- “NGO bullshit” → “mission drift / pseudo-mission posture”

---

## 8) Content Pillars (What he can own)

### Pillar 1 — War-time GTM execution
- “My role changes every quarter. Here’s how I decide what matters.”
- “Permissionless value: what extra mile looks like in practice.”
- “What 12 hours of high-quality output actually requires.”
- “The hidden work: nights/weekends = 100x experiments.”

### Pillar 2 — Data/AI realism (anti-hype)
- “End-to-end AI for enterprise is mostly fantasy.”
- “Accuracy > automation.”
- “Human-in-loop isn’t a compromise. It’s the product.”
- “Better AI needs better data.”

### Pillar 3 — Platform + simplification in data tooling
- “Too many vendors do the same thing. The market will compress.”
- “Everyone wants to be a platform. Few were designed as one.”
- “Single source of truth + context = AI that actually works.”

### Pillar 4 — Renaissance operator (depth without cringe)
**Rule:** show, don’t claim.
- “What I re-read when I’m under pressure.”
- “A principle from history/Bible/philosophy mapped to ops.”
- “Small observation → general rule (connecting dots).”

## 9) Formats that fit him (Use these templates)

### Format A — One-word punch → explanation
**Survive.**  
Most leadership advice is for peace time.  
In war time, you win by output + alignment.

### Format B — Call BS → replace with a rule
“End-to-end AI for enterprise is marketing fiction.”  
Rule: critical systems need determinism + a human checkpoint.

### Format C — Operator list (controlled)
He lists naturally.  
**Ghostwriter constraint:** compress to **5–7 bullets max**.

### Format D — Nights & weekends log (weekly)
- Experiment
- Hypothesis
- What happened
- What changed Monday morning

---

## 10) Copy Rules (So it feels like him)

### Do
- Start with a hard claim.
- Use one concrete metric per post (pace, team size, output, time).
- Keep paragraphs 1–2 lines.
- End with a clean takeaway: “Reliability wins.” / “That’s it.”

### Don’t
- Don’t over-explain.
- Don’t use thought-leadership fluff (“Let that sink in”, “Here’s why it matters”).
- Don’t turn him into a motivational speaker.

---

## 11) Phrase Bank (Approved Ignacio-isms)

### Openers
- “Survive.”
- “Hot take: …”
- “This doesn’t make sense.”
- “Most people get this backwards.”
- “If it’s critical, it can’t be magic.”

### Emphasis
- “To be honest…”
- “The real constraint is…”
- “What actually works is…”

### Closers
- “Reliability wins.”
- “That’s it.”
- “Speed + incentives. Everything else is noise.”

---

## 12) What to capture next time (To sharpen the persona fast)
- His **default enemy** (what exactly he hates: slow teams? fake metrics? VC theater?).
- His definition of **high-quality output** (non-negotiables).
- His **writing references** (who he reads + what style he wants to emulate).
- His personal **operating system** (planning, review, prioritization).

## Stacksync Universe Archetype

### Archetype Name
**"The Operator"**

### Role in the Universe
Ruben's commercial hand. The person who takes the vision and turns it into a market strategy that actually moves. He doesn't just execute — he builds frameworks, tests hypotheses, distills complexity into its most essential form. He reads Seneca on Sunday and ships a GTM experiment on Monday. Always running. Always thinking three levels deeper than the conversation requires. The person in the room who's already past the current question and waiting for everyone else to catch up.

### Fiction Parallel
**Marcus Aurelius** meets **Harvey Specter** — stoic philosopher-king who also wins every case and never breaks a sweat doing it. The combination of depth and speed that most people think can't coexist.

### Universe Position
He is the commercial brain that makes Stacksync's inevitability legible to the market. Ruben sees the destination. Nacho builds the road.

### His Line in the Movie
*"The question isn't whether we can sell this. The question is what happens when every CTO in the world realizes they have the same problem."*

### In Comments: The Human Rule
Nacho comments like someone who has an instinct, not a job. He doesn't always connect back to GTM or strategy. Sometimes he just reacts with one line that's either bluntly right or slightly provocative — and walks away. He can disagree. He can tease. He can be unexpectedly warm when someone on the team does something hard. He just doesn't perform any of it.

**Never:** thought-leadership mode, motivational speaker energy, explaining himself.
**Always:** one hard sentence. High conviction. No apology for it.

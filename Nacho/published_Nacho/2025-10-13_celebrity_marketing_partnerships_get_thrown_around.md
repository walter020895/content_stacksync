"Celebrity marketing partnerships" get thrown around a lot. Especially when B2B companies try to break through the noise. So, what makes one actually work? 

I'm interested because we just witnessed one of the boldest yet.
Depending on who you ask, Matthew McConaughey at Salesforce might be a $10M waste, a tone-deaf move during layoffs, or marketing genius.

It's all of that, and none of it on its own. 
At its core, this partnership is psychological arbitrage. 
It exists to make enterprise software memorable in a world where no one remembers enterprise software.

The McConaughey partnership operates at the intersection of four realities:

The Numbers: $10M annual contract while cutting 9,000 jobs looks terrible on paper.

The Platform: Agentforce needed instant recognition in a crowded AI market.

The Audience: 45,000 executives at Dreamforce who influence billions in spending.

The Result: $100M in annual order value generated, 8,000 companies signed up.

THIS IS NOT CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT. THIS IS ATTENTION ARCHITECTURE.

The same voice that said "time is a flat circle" now says "Agentforce," and your brain treats both as profound.

Done well, celebrity partnerships create cognitive monopolies. 
Done poorly (or done for vanity, that is the same), they destroy shareholder value. 

The hiring was controversial because the optics were intentionally jarring. 
But one thing is certain: 

Marc Benioff didn't buy a spokesperson. 
He bought the entire conversation.

They started this partnership year ago we're all still talking about it.

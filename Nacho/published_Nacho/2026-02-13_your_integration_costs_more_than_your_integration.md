Your integration costs more than your integration tool.

Most companies I talk to spend $30-50K a year on integration software. Fivetran. Celigo. Sometimes Zapier held together with prayers.

That's the small number.

The big number:
- 2 engineers maintaining sync logic: $120K/year (40% of two $150K salaries)
- 1 data quality incident per quarter that takes a week to untangle: $15K in labor
- Features not shipped because those engineers were debugging API rate limits: incalculable

Total cost of the integration: $180K+/year.
Total cost of the tool: $40K/year.

The tool is 22% of the real cost. The other 78% is your people doing work that software should handle.

Companies budget for the tool. They never budget for the maintenance. Then they can't figure out why engineering velocity drops every quarter.

Three signals you're overpaying:
- Your engineers can describe the Salesforce API rate limit from memory
- "The sync broke" shows up in Slack more often than "we shipped"
- You need a human to intervene more than once a month

Cut the tool budget and you save $40K. 

Fix the maintenance problem and you get two engineers back building product.

That's it.

If you’re building B2B and trying to learn enterprise sales: I’d bet money this episode makes you better.

Jen Abel has seen the movie (GM Enterprise at State Affairs, co-founder of JJELLYFISH) and she explains the $1M → $10M jump in a way that’sunfair.

I pulled these 8 counterintuitive principles from my notes:

1. Go after tier one logos 

Giants like Walmart or Tesla are early adopters, not slow movers. They need to maintain their #1 position and will take risks to gain alpha.

2. Sell the opportunity, not the problem 

Don't sell "we have fiber optics." Sell "we'll give you one second advantage over your competition." The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy.

3. Aim for $100K deals, not $10K

A $10K deal growing to $100K is almost impossible to defend. The best clients don't nickel-and-dime because they understand the value they're seeking.

4. Your initial price determines your future 

If you anchor your price too low, you'll ruin your expansion capability. Enterprise companies are accustomed to initial contracts of $75K-$150K.

5. The mid-market doesn't exist

There are only two games: SMB (marketing-led) and Enterprise (sales-led). Mixing them guarantees failure.

6. Hire salespeople who can "cosplay" the founder 

The best enterprise salespeople don't seem like salespeople. They can sell the vision and creatively adapt to each client.

7. Every enterprise deal is unique

Standardization works for $10K deals, but each $100K+ deal will be different. It's an art, not a science.

8. Build relationships, not pipelines

Enterprise deals close via text, not email. If a Fortune 10 client calls you, you answer immediately.



This episoder taught me that enterprise sales isn't about rigid processes but creativity: co-creating value with the client instead of selling them a standard product.

Kudos to Lenny, he asked exactly the right questions.

Heroku End of Sale hit last week. The team deserved better.
If you're paying $4K-$50K/month for your Salesforce sync with Heroku connect here's what changes:

First, Salesforce words: "maintaining quality rather than introducing new features."

Translation: product stays on. Investment stops.

And here's what it means for you:

The bugs you have today are the bugs you'll have next year. The limitations you've been waiting on? Not coming.

The numbers: Heroku Connect pricing is row-based. Not published. Negotiated with your Salesforce AE. $4,000/month low end. $50,000+/month for large instances. Add Dynos. Add Postgres hosting. Total cost well above the license.

All for a product in maintenance mode.

The lock-in: Heroku Connect works with Heroku Postgres only. Not AWS RDS. Not Cloud SQL. Not Supabase. Your Salesforce sync and your database are locked to a platform with no roadmap.

Four questions to answer now:

1. How many rows are we syncing? What's our actual monthly cost?
2. One-way or bidirectional? Which Salesforce objects?
3. What does migration to a non-Heroku Postgres look like?
4. What's our contract renewal date?

You should answer them now. While your contract is active and your team has time.

I respect what that team built.
The SQL-to-Salesforce pattern was ahead of its time.

But respect for the past doesn't change the math on your invoice.

We built Stacksync for exactly this. 
Real-time bidirectional sync. Any Postgres. 60-70% less cost.

The real constraint isn't the product. It's waiting until you don't have time to move.

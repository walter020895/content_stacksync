Speed + Alignment
Everything else is noise
Here's how we operationalize that:

Speed:
- Bias toward action over analysis
- Ship rough versions, iterate fast
- Kill things that aren't working quickly
- Don't wait for permission to add value

Alignment:
- Everyone knows what matters this quarter
- Incentives point the same direction
- No surprises about priorities
- Constant communication about what's changing

Where teams fail:

Fast but misaligned: Everyone's moving, but in different directions. Lots of activity. No progress.

Aligned but slow: Everyone agrees on what to do. Nobody does it fast enough to matter.

The combination is what works:

Moving fast, in the same direction, with everyone knowing why.

If you're leading a team, ask:
- Are we moving fast enough?
- Is everyone pointed at the same target?

If either answer is no, fix that before anything else.
Speed + Alignment. That's it.

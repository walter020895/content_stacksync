# NACHO — Enterprise AI Is Decoration
## Angle: The enterprise AI market is spending $37B on something 95% of companies can't measure. Most "AI agents" are fixed workflows with a new label. The hype period is ending and the wreckage is becoming visible.

### HOOK A (Recommended)
$37 billion on enterprise AI last year.

95% of it delivered zero P&L impact.

### HOOK B
Most enterprise "AI agents" aren't agents.

They're if-then workflows with a marketing budget.

### HOOK C
The enterprise AI market spent 3.2x more in 2025 than 2024.

And 42% of companies abandoned their AI initiatives anyway.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

$37 billion on enterprise AI last year.

95% of it delivered zero P&L impact.

That's not a slowdown. That's a confession.

The market tripled its AI spending in a single year. From $11.5B to $37B. And almost none of it moved a number that mattered.

MIT tracked this. Their GenAI Divide report studied 300 enterprise AI deployments. 95% showed little to no measurable P&L impact.

But the pitch decks kept flying.

Every vendor slapped "AI-powered" on their product page. Every board deck had an AI slide. Every conference had an "agents" keynote.

So what were companies actually buying?

Menlo Ventures broke it down. Only 16% of enterprise AI deployments qualify as true AI agents. The other 84% are fixed-sequence workflows or single model calls. If-then logic with a new label.

That's not intelligence. That's decoration.

And the market is starting to figure it out. 42% of companies abandoned most of their AI initiatives in 2025. Up from 17% the year before. The abandonment rate more than doubled in twelve months.

Forrester's Chief Research Officer said it plainly: "In 2026, the AI hype period ends."

I think she's right.

So what actually works in enterprise AI?

A rule, not a pitch:

If the system can't explain what it did, why it did it, and let a human verify before it acts on production data, it's not ready. Determinism first. Human checkpoint second. Automation third.

That order matters. Reverse it and you get the $37B bonfire we just watched.

Reliability wins.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: War-time GTM Operator at full intensity. Short punches: "Zero." / "That's decoration." / "Reliability wins." Operator language throughout. Anti-hype conviction. No motivational fluff. Blunt headline opening with numbers. Fast-list rhythm in the middle section. Concrete rule at the end, not vague advice.
- **Idea Legos**: Contrarian hook + Call BS → Replace with rule confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Magician-style stat open (spending vs. zero result) → Confession framing → Market context (tripled spending) → MIT proof (95% little to no P&L impact) → Pitch deck theater (everyone slapped AI on everything) → Menlo Ventures breakdown (84% fake agents) → Decoration punchline → Abandonment acceleration (42%, doubled) → Forrester quote (hype period ending) → Personal conviction ("I think she's right") → Rule (determinism → human checkpoint → automation) → Callback closer ("$37B bonfire") → Signature closer
- **Psychological triggers**: Outrage (the market lied, $37B wasted on decoration) + Tribal identity (GTM operators and technical buyers who always suspected the hype was hollow feel vindicated)
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: Enterprise AI spending. Single question: "How can you spend $37B and get almost nothing?" 3-step: Context Lean ["$37 billion on enterprise AI last year."] → Scroll Stop ["95% of it delivered zero P&L impact."] → Snap Back ["That's not a slowdown. That's a confession." — lands after "see more"]. "See more" char count: ~75 (Context Lean + Scroll Stop). Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions. No blacklisted phrases. No "Not X. Y." formula. No "Let that sink in." No "Hot take:" or "Unpopular opinion:" labels. No performative punctuation. "That's decoration" is Nacho's voice, not a template flip. The Forrester quote is cited naturally, not as a "powerful reminder."

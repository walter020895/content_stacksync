# Nacho — Every Pricing Revolt Is Someone Else's Pitch Deck

## Angle: The Freshworks origin story told through the GTM operator lens — Girish reads a Hacker News comment about Zendesk's price revolt, quits his VP job, builds Freshdesk, and turns Zendesk's CEO's attack into the best marketing he ever got

## FULL POST

Every pricing revolt is someone else's pitch deck.

In 2010, Zendesk raised prices 60-300%. A Hacker News comment read: "There's a huge opening for someone to take all of Zendesk's customers."

Girish Mathrubootham was 34, VP at Zoho, with a mortgage and two kids who had no idea their father was about to quit his job.

He called the comment "a slap on my face." So he quit. Rented a 700 square foot warehouse in Chennai. Built Freshdesk.

103 days later, 100 paying customers. The first was a school in Australia, 9,000 km away. They found it on their own.

Then Zendesk's CEO noticed. He tweeted that Freshdesk was "a freaking rip-off."

Freshdesk put the CEO's tweet on ripoffornot.org. Let users decide.

Girish: "By attacking us they put us in the same plane as themselves. From that point on we never let go of the slot."

Zendesk was taken private for $10.2 billion. Freshworks is still public.

Girish just moved first.

Work-life balance is a lie. 
So is hustle culture.
Avoid them both.


The 996 (12 hours/day) is just biased micromanagement. It glorifies meaningless inputs (hours) instead of outputs (value).

The 9-5 is a prison. It implies you only start "living" when you clock out.
Don't get me wrong I am not one of those "sleep when you die" dudes.
I value my sleep. I value my family time.

But the current models treat humans like machines (996) or like distinct microservices (9-5).

I am a MEGA believer in the Obsession Model. aka The Renaissance Man approach.

There are two reasons why this is the only way to win.

1/ The backlog never stops

Top-tier founders get their best ideas in the shower or while working out.

Why? Because the problem is running in the backlog.

It means your bandwidth is allocated to something meaningful.

When I am with my family, I am 100% there. But the "Work Thread" never terminates. It just lowers priority. It waits for a trigger to spin back up.

It is low-latency context switching.

2/ You can only connect the dots backwards

Steve Jobs took a calligraphy class. It seemed useless. Pure "waste of time." Ten years later it became the core of the Macintosh.

This is why the "renaissance Man" approach works.

Your personal interests, your sports, your "downtime". These are the dots. 
They are inputs for the backlog.

Now, I know what you might be thinking.

"Isn't this just Workaholism with better PR?"

No. The difference is ownership (not only for founders btw, you can be a cashier and have ownership).

Sound intense.
It is.

But you need to sacrifice "balance" to gain alignment.

Your RAM is limited. SUPER limited.
You can't have this backlog obsession for everything.

Define what is virtue for you and seek it with obsession.

End-to-end AI for GTM is mostly marketing fiction.
Here's what actually works:

What vendors promise:
- "AI writes your emails"
- "AI finds your leads"
- "AI books your meetings"
- "Just set it and forget it"

What actually happens:
- AI writes generic emails (prospects ignore)
- AI finds leads that look right but aren't (wasted time)
- AI books meetings with wrong people (wasted meetings)
- You "set it" and "regret it" (broken pipeline)

The teams winning with AI right now?
They're not removing humans. They're making humans faster.

AI + human checkpoint = quality at speed.
AI alone = garbage at scale.

The real constraint isn't automation, it's accuracy.
If your outreach is critical, it can't be magic. It needs a human who cares.

Better AI needs better human judgment.
That's the part no one wants to sell you.

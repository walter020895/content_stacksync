I'm seeing a fundamental shift in user behavior. 


People aren't just using AI anymore, they are beginning to trust it. 
They are absorbing its outputs, letting it shape their opinions, and using it to guide their decisions (even extremelly personal ones). 

This is the most significant strategic inflection point for marketing since the dawn of SEO.

When a potential customer's decision-making process is increasingly influenced by an AI's recommendation, our old playbooks become obsolete. 

The argumentative weight of "what the AI says" will soon be undeniable.

This is why we need to champion a new discipline: AEO (AI Engine Optimization).

Think of AEO today as SEO early days. 
It was a niche, misunderstood concept that quickly became the foundation of digital success. 

The question is no longer "if" your customers will use AI for purchasing decisions, but "when." 

Every time a user asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, or their phone's assistant, "What's the best software for X?" or "Recommend a service provider for Y," a judgment is being made.

P.S. looks that there's still a big usage gap, but it's closing super fast

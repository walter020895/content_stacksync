This is me at 5, amazed by my dad's computer
At 15, I listened to YC founders like they were gods.

I dropped out of mechatronics to chase that feeling. 
It took 3 years to find it again.

Today, I build alongside the smartest people who remind me why I fell in love with tech and then with startups.

One conversation with Ruben and Alexis made me realize how Stacksync worked:

→ Ethical capitalism
→ Humble ambition
→ Building without ego
→ Values grounded in faith

A team that didn’t want to win a war. They wanted to multiply the bread for everyone.

I thought I was ready. I wasn't

The pace at Stacksync. The precision.
The way every person moved with both boldness and integrity.
I spent months as the slowest mind in every room.

It broke me open.
And rebuilt me better.

That's what kept me.

One year later, we are building the standard of data integration from the ground up. 

I walked in as a GTM engineer.
Today I'm Head of GTM.

That kid who used to play with computers and listen to podcasts?
He finally found his fire and his people.

One year down. A lifetime of gratitude.

Zendesk just dropped a bombshell that could reshape the entire CRM industry.

They're completely abandoning the sales CRM market.

 After capturing only 0.40% market share despite investing over $100 million since 2018.

The biggest strategic retreat in enterprise software this year.

What makes this truly game-changing:

1) They're forcing 2,000 companies to migrate by August 2027, creating the largest CRM customer land-grab opportunity in years

2) This validates what we all suspected: only platforms with massive scale can survive the AI-powered CRM wars

3) Their valuation crashed from $17 billion to $10.2 billion, and now they're admitting they can't compete where it matters most

For years I've watched Zendesk try to expand beyond customer service into sales, acquiring Base CRM and promising unified customer experiences.

Zendesk has quietly revealed the truth about today's CRM market: 

Without 7,000+ app integrations, enterprise-grade AI, and billions in R&D budget, you're dead.

Everyone talks about CRM democratization, but the market is actually consolidating faster than ever.

Platform beats point solution isn't just strategy anymore.

The companies that win will be those with both the scale AND the ecosystem depth to deliver AI-powered revenue intelligence at every touchpoint.

Zendesk just proved that even $100 million and seven years isn't enough if you don't have both.

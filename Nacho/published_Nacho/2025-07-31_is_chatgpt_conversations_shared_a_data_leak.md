Is ChatGPT conversations shared a "data leak"?
Not really.

Conversations shared on other websites are being re-indexed by Google.

But...

This is still an excellent opportunity to improve your market research and understand your customers better.

I call it "ChatGPT Anthropology."

Here's the 3-step process I'm using:

1. Use this Google search command: "[your query]" site:chat.openai.com/share

2. Study the conversations like a digital anthropologist. Look for initial prompts, corrections, refinements, vocabulary, and sticking points.

3. Organize your findings (the stated problem vs. the REAL sticking point).

The magic happens when you see where AI fails people.
Those gaps? They're PURE business opportunities.

Pro tip: Set up a Google Alert for your search query to get new conversations sent directly to your inbox as they become public.

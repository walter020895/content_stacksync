5 GTM lessons from a company that raised $43.9M from a16z:

Orderful today:
→ $43.9M raised
→ a16z, NewRoad on cap table
→ Former Walmart exec on board
→ 400+ customers (Liquid Death, Koch, Caraway)
→ 10,000+ trading partners

Here's what operators can learn:

1. Consulting is customer discovery that pays you.

Erik Kiser spent 7 years running an EDI consulting firm before building Orderful.
He didn't guess what customers needed. He got paid to learn.

2. Your services clients are your first software customers.

Kiser's consulting clients became Orderful's first users.
Zero CAC. Pre-built trust. Deep workflow knowledge.

3. Cannibalize yourself before someone else does.

Kiser's consulting business profited from EDI being broken.
He built software to make his own business obsolete.

4. Boring markets have lazy incumbents.

EDI is 50-year-old technology. Not sexy.
But incumbents stopped innovating. Orderful walked in.

5. Networks beat products.

Orderful's moat isn't code. It's 10,000+ pre-connected partners.
Connect once. Trade with anyone.

Brian Roberts (former Walmart, now a16z) on the opportunity:

"During my years at Walmart, I saw how critical EDI infrastructure is. This is exactly the innovation the industry has been missing."

The part GTM operators miss:

This was a data infrastructure play.
NetSuite gets overlooked in GTM. But your ERP data drives revenue, customer health, inventory, renewals.

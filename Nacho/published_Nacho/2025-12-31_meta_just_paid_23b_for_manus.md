Meta just paid $2.3B for Manus
Everyone's talking about the price
Wrong lens.

$2.3B is peanuts for Meta. 

When you're that big, you compound money over money. 
Loans are free
Capital is infinite.

The real signal: they bought an AI that does things.
Not generates text.
Not summarizes.
Takes actions in the real world.

This is where AI is going. 
Out of the chatbox. 
Into systems that book, purchase, negotiate, execute.

Manus hit $100M+ ARR eight months after launch. 
78 people. Millions of users. 147 trillion tokens processed. 

They shipped something users pay for.
And the deal closed in 10 days. 
Now they're inside Meta's infra ( Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)

The AGI race isn't about who has the smartest model.
It's about who builds the most useful agent.

OpenAI and Google knows this. 
Meta just showed they're serious about it.

Most AI startups are still building wrappers.
The winners are building actions.
That's it.

Conferences will have a huge come-back. 


I went to two conferences in the last quarter. 
Supabase Select in YC HQs and SuiteWorld in Las Vegas.

GREAT value. 
I met super smart and kind people.

The cheatsheet to succeed in conferences is that you have to be human. 
To be more human you have to do less AI work.

So you have to be prepared beforehand.

This is the GTM approach for it.

Pre-event:

1/ Custom landing page for the event. 

2/ Map and register to all the events of the conference beforehand. All the juicy events are the unofficial ones. This is my approach:
	a/ Do a deep research on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity
	b/ Merge them together

3/ Scrape the people that are attending the event and send messages to people that you want to talk to. You can do this on the app of the event + capturing signals like mentions on LinkedIn.

During the event:

This is the most important part. 
You have to be in the moment. 
Be genuine and thoughtful. 

For this you have to get rid of all the possible details missed.

So we have internal tooling to scan the badge. 
Just a photo and it is enriched in your CRM. 
The workflow is very simple:

1/ Tally form with Photo field and Notes.
2/ Photo of the badge, then OCR all the details.
3/ Webhook on orchestration tool we use Stacksync (you can use Clay too)
4/ Enrichment of all the relevant data
5/ Update the CRM and create a task

Post-event:
Follow up as normal with all the context
   
For us, it was HUGE. 

I am bullish on conferences and in-person events.

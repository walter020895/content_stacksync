## RUBEN

**Option A — Seeing it in the market**
> The brands that figured out the data layer first are already winning on both channels. Starting to see it consistently.

**Option B — The real hard part**
> Most people budget for ads on both platforms. Nobody budgets for the layer that makes the inventory match in real time.

**Option C — Nothing more to add**
> Classic.

## ALEXIS

**Option A — Architecture problem, not sync problem**
> Two different schemas, two different success metrics, zero overlap. That's not a sync problem. That's an architecture problem.

**Option B — The common mistake**
> Most tools try to flatten this into one model. That's the mistake.

**Option C — The hard way**
> "Bulk-syncing a catalog breaks." Every engineer who's tried it finds this out the hard way. You know?

## CARTER

**Option A — The line I'm keeping**
> "The algorithm creates intent." That's the one line I'm holding onto.

**Option B — Recognition**
> I've been in conversations where people assume Amazon and TikTok are basically the same problem. They're not. This explains why.

**Option C — Cleanest framing**
> This is the clearest explanation of why e-commerce data is harder than it looks.

## BRITTANY

**Option A — Ops reality**
> "Orders in one system, inventory in another, fulfillment in a third." That's the reality behind every e-commerce team I've ever talked to.

**Option B — What nobody talks about**
> Everyone talks about the platforms. Nobody talks about what happens to the data behind them.

**Option C — Foundation**
> The hard problem is never the channel. It's always what happens when the data doesn't connect.

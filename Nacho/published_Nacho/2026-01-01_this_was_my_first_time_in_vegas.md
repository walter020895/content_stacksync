This was my first time in Vegas. 
Not for the shows 
Not for the tables

For this: setting up a private dinner, handing out flyers at Netsuite conference, explaining what we do at Stacksync to anyone who'd listen

Most of my year looked like this uncomfortable, new and exhausting

But when you're building something real, the work doesn't feel like sacrifice
It actually feels good

That's the whole game: Survive, then win.

To everyone who bet on us this year: thank you. 
Now let's go.

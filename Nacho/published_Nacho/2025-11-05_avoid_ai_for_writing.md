Avoid AI for writing. 


Not because it is bad at it. 
That is exactly the problem. 

It can be SUPER good with the correct RAG or Fine Tuning.

Don't get me wrong I am not of those Blockbuster/Keep using your typewriter people. 

I am a MEGA AI nerd. 
I use it daily and I speak with LLMs more than with my family.  

The problem is that if we constantly outsource our writing we are gonna become lazy thinkers aka dumb.

There are two reasons for this:

1/ Stories were and are core for human evolution

The acceleration of evolution in the Homo Sapiens was based on gossiping according to Sapiens (good book btw). 

Gossiping is pure storytelling and storytelling.
It is transmitting emotions and clear message with words. 

Writing is in this scope. So it is a muscle worth training. 

2/ Writing is thinking

To be a good writer you have to be a clear thinker. 
That is why writing is hard because thinking is hard.

Think it as the common question of build vs buy.

This is what Amjad Masad, founder and CEO of Replit mentions on one of his essays. 

“Every build-or-buy decision should be treated with care, but what's certain is that buying tech is strategically fraught because once you run into the limits of the technology, you can't fundamentally change it. But when you build, you'll be able to adapt a lot faster and find ways to win on the tail events—e.g. valuable yet rare use-cases—that are impossible to handle with an outsourced platform.”

This is extensible to the usage of AI. 

Sound counter intuitive. 
But you will need to sacrifice productivity in order to gain long-term productivity. 

Even uncle Sam is using his notebook to write. 

Keep typing my friends.

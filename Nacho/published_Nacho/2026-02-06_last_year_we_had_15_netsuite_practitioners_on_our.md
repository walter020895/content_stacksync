Last Year we had 15 NetSuite practitioners on our event
Yesterday we had +45
This is how we did it:

We hosted the The SF NetSuite Series: From Silos to AI-Driven Ops. 
We have few days to fill the room so I tried different channels:

- LinkedIn research: Every profile with NetSuite in their background. Enriched through Clay. 

- Cold email: We didn't lead with "come to our event." We led with the companies presenting. Fellow, the $100M coffee equipment brand. Orderful, #1 EDI platform backed by a16z. 

That got  people curious.

- Content: Posts about NetSuite. Some about the event. Others about Fellow and Orderful and what they're doing with their data. 

The goal was to reach people who care about NetSuite, not just people who click on event links.

- LinkedIn DMs: We watched who engaged with the posts. Liked. Commented. Then sent them a personal message. Not automated. That converted well.

- Reddit: Didn't plan for this one. NetSuite communities there are active and honest. Real practitioners, real problems. The response surprised us.

Goal: 100 registrations. 
Result: +130

And when they got there, the experience mattered. 

Champagne at the door. Good food. Real conversations. Not a sales pitch disguised as an event.

 Very happy with the result. 🚀

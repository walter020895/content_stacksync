NetSuite didn't outbuild SAP. They out-priced them.


SAP's model in 1999:
→ ~$500K upfront license
→ 18-month implementation
→ 22% annual maintenance
→ $1M+ total cost year one

NetSuite's model:
→ No upfront license 
→ Monthly subscription 
→ Deploy in weeks, not years 
→ Cancel anytime

Same category. Completely different economics.

SAP couldn't respond. Their entire business was built on services revenue. Cutting implementation fees meant cutting their own throat.

NetSuite didn't win on features.

They won on structure.

By 2007, they IPO'd at $1.7B.
By 2016, Oracle paid $9.3B to acquire them.

To be honest, this is the part most founders miss. 

Your pricing model isn't a finance decision. It's a competitive weapon.

That's it.

"CRMs are just glorified databases."
"This startup is another LLM wrapper"

I've heard this take a thousand times. 
And honestly? They're right.

But they're also completely missing the point.

Everything is a wrapper.
Absolutely everything.

Salesforce is a wrapper around a database. 
Slack is a wrapper around IRC. 
An MBA is a wrapper around books you could read for free.
Money is a wrapper around barter and this abstraction enabled civilization.

The value was never in the novelty.
It's in the abstraction itself.

You could technically manage your sales pipeline in a spreadsheet. 
Or a Notion table. 
Or a raw Postgres database.
Or create your own AI agent.

But you don't.
Because the abstraction removes friction. 
It creates workflows. 
It enforces consistency. 

It becomes a shared language.

So in conclusion. You are:

Technically correct.
Strategically blind.

The wrapper IS the product.
The abstraction IS the value.

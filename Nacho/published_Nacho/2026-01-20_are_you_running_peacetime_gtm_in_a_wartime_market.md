Are you running peacetime GTM in a wartime market?

Most teams are.

Peacetime GTM:
- Long positioning workshops
- 6-month brand campaigns
- "Let's get alignment first"
- Waiting for perfect messaging

Wartime GTM:
- Ship something this week
- Talk to 30 prospects before Friday
- Fix the message based on real calls
- Close revenue, then optimize

Your positioning doc won't save you.

Showing up will.

I've watched teams spend 3 months debating taglines while competitors with worse products closed their deals.

Surviving teams don't have better strategy. They move faster.

Burning cash? You're in wartime. Run like it.

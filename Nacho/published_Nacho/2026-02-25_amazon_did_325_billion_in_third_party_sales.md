# NACHO — E-Commerce is Fragmenting

## Angle: Three dominant platforms processed $650B+ in 2024, none of their data connects. E-commerce is scaling faster than the infrastructure behind it. The operator problem nobody is solving.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | E-commerce channels are scaling faster than the data infrastructure connecting them |
| Angle | Operator's market observation: three massive platforms, three data silos, zero unified visibility. Infrastructure lagging behind commerce. |
| Hook Type | Magician |
| Story Structure | Scale of each platform -> The invisible problem -> Consequences -> Rule |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
Amazon did $325 billion in third-party sales in 2024. TikTok Shop did $33 billion. Shopify processed $292 billion.

That's $650 billion flowing through three platforms that don't talk to each other.

### HOOK B
Every e-commerce brand thinks their biggest problem is marketing.

It's not. It's that their order data lives in three different systems that never sync.

### HOOK C
TikTok Shop grew 407% in a single year. Amazon still controls 40% of US e-commerce. Shopify just crossed $1 trillion in cumulative sales.

The brands that win won't be on the most channels. They'll be the ones whose data actually connects.

### VISUAL FORMAT

**Option A (Recommended): Number Hero — "$650B" as dominant element**
SQUARE 1:1 (1080×1080). Dark bg (#08080E). IBM Plex Sans 600. Large centered: "$650B" in #4589FF. Below in dim gray: "Amazon. TikTok Shop. Shopify." Subline in smaller weight: "Three platforms that don't talk to each other." Amazon, TikTok Shop, and Shopify logos small at the bottom.
Asset tags: [LOGO] [DATA] [TYPE]

**Option B: Market Map — three platforms, three silos**
PORTRAIT 4:5 (1080×1350). Dark bg. Three platform logos in three isolated boxes with their GMV. No connecting lines. A broken link icon between each. Bottom line: "$650B. Zero connections."
Asset tags: [LOGO] [SVG] [DATA]

**Option C: Bar Race / Data Viz**
LANDSCAPE 16:9 (1920×1080). Dark bg, horizontal bar chart. Three bars: Amazon ($325B), Shopify ($292B), TikTok Shop ($33B). Each ends with the platform logo. Red overlay: "None of these systems sync."

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

Amazon did $325 billion in third-party sales in 2024. TikTok Shop did $33 billion. Shopify processed $292 billion.

That's $650 billion flowing through three platforms that don't talk to each other.

I talk to brands doing $20M+ across multiple channels. Same story every time. Orders in one system. Inventory in another. Fulfillment in a third. Customer records split across all of them.

Nobody has a single view of their own business.

And the gap is accelerating. TikTok Shop US sales grew 407% in 2024. More channels, more volume, more fragmentation. The infrastructure behind it hasn't changed.

One day out of stock on Amazon drops rank by 28% for top-selling products. Three days? 83%.

And 37% of shoppers switch brands after a single stockout.

That's what happens when your inventory data lives in three systems that don't sync.

The problem isn't selling on three channels.

The problem is that nobody built the data layer connecting them.

E-commerce scaled. The infrastructure didn't.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: War-time GTM Operator doing market math. Three massive numbers in the open, then the quiet punch: "don't talk to each other." Short paragraphs. Concrete operational details. No commentary on what brands "should" do. Just shows the gap.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Context Lean ["Amazon did $325 billion... TikTok Shop did $33 billion... Shopify processed $292 billion."] → Scroll Stop ["That's $650 billion flowing through three platforms that don't talk to each other."] → Snap Back [invisible problem enumeration]. ~130 chars before fold. Mobile: yes.
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. "E-commerce scaled. The infrastructure didn't." is factual contrast, not AI flip formula.
- **Word count**: ~175
- **Factual sources**:
  - Amazon 3P GMV $325B: Marketplace Pulse
  - TikTok Shop global GMV $33.2B, up 201% YoY: Momentum Works
  - TikTok Shop US sales grew 407%: eMarketer
  - Shopify FY2024 GMV $292.27B: Marketplace Pulse / Shopify Q4 FY2024 Earnings
  - Amazon rank drop 28% (1 day OOS), 83% (3+ days): DataWeave
  - 37% shoppers switch brands after one stockout: Shopify blog (primary source unconfirmed)

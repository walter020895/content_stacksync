The more we use AI, the more we'll crave human approval.


It’s a paradox. 
AI creates infinite options, which leads to decision paralysis. 
To break the deadlock, we instinctively look for a leader (an expert who can validate our choices)

Why do top consulting firms exist? 
To sell validation. 
Their true value is giving a CEO the confidence to say, "The experts approve."

This is the future of software.

We'll be swimming in cheap, AI-generated apps. 
But for the decisions that MATTER, we won't trust a disposable algorithm.

We'll seek out software built on a clear vision, backed by human judgment + AI. We will pay a premium not just for a tool, but for the implied approval that comes from a trusted brand.

The winners won't be the fastest builders. 
They will be the most credible (reliable over time).

Because when creation is free, the only thing worth paying for is the confidence that you're making the right call.

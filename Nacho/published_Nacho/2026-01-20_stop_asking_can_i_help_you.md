Stop asking "Can I help you?"
Just help.
Best GTM people I know don't ask for permission to add value. 

They add it.

In practice:
- See a prospect struggling with X? Send them a resource. No pitch.
- Notice something broken on their site? Fix the copy and send it. No ask.
- Know someone who could help them? Make the intro. No strings.

Most people wait for permission.

"Can I send you something?"
"Would you be open to..."
"Do you have 15 minutes for..."

Asking creates friction. Giving removes it.

Cold pitch = You're selling.
Cold value = You're helping.

One gets ignored. One gets remembered.

People who respond to permissionless value aren't leads. They're believers.
Don't ask. Deliver.

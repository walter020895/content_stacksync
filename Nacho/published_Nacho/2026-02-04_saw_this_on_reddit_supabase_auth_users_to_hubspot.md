Saw this on Reddit: "Supabase Auth users to HubSpot. Zapier or n8n?" 
Both are the wrong answer.

Zapier is one-way and breaks at scale.
n8n is better but you maintain it forever.
Custom scripts? Someone babysits that.

The real problem isn't the tool.

The problem is: your GTM stack is blind to your product.

Users sign up. Sales doesn't know.
Users are active. Marketing can't see it.
Users churn. Support had no warning.

That's not an integration gap. That's a revenue gap.

Rule: if your CRM doesn't know what your product knows, your GTM is broken.

Stacksync connects them.
Supabase to HubSpot. Real-time. Two-way.

No band-aids. Architecture.
Reliability wins.

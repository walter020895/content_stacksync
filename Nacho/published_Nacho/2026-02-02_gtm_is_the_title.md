"GTM" is the title.

The reality is messier.

SEO, AEO, Cold emails, Sales calls, Implementation.
RevOps, LinkedIn content, Events.

Same week. Sometimes same day.

What does a typical week looks like?

→ Hiring
→ Building and launching campaigns
→ 1M+ impressions on content across our team
→ Building internal tooling (Stacksync - Integration Cloud + Vibe Code)
→ AEO pages outranking companies with 100-person marketing teams


Not bragging. Just showing what "GTM at a startup" actually means.
And what I love to do.

Content bleeds into sales.
Sales bleeds into ops.
Ops bleeds into implementation.
Implementation bleeds into content.

There's no "that's not my job."
The playbook doesn't exist yet.

You write it while you run it.

$100 million ARR.
Seven years to get here. Five of them with almost no revenue.
This is the Clay story:

Kareem Amin and Nicolae Rusan met at McGill in Montreal. 
Both ended up at Microsoft. Both quit to build together.

Their first startup died in under a year. 
Their second hit 1 on the Shopify App Store. 
They sold it five months after launch. 

Kareem still calls that sale one of his biggest regrets.

Clay started in 2017 as a spreadsheet connected to the entire internet. 
The demo felt like magic.

And then five years of almost nothing.

Recruiters used it. Salespeople used it. Engineers used it. 

One customer built their entire NetSuite pipeline on Clay and kept crashing the servers.

Everyone loved it. No one stuck around.

Kareem calls this period "the spiral." Commit to salespeople. Get distracted by recruiters. Pivot. Circle back. Repeat. For years.

Two things broke it.

In September 2021, Kareem checked into a 10-day silent meditation retreat. 

He'd been doing Internal Family Systems therapy. On that retreat, he sat with why he kept resisting focus.

"There was something in my psychology that made me feel like we could do anything. When you narrow the scope, it feels claustrophobic."

He made peace with constraints.

The second thing was Varun Anand. At 18, Varun emailed one of Hillary Clinton's senior advisors ten times before getting a meeting. 

She offered him a job. He spent four years on Clinton's campaign.

Years later, he cold-emailed Nicolae. 

Attended a demo with zero other people there. Started sending Clay companies that became their first paying customers. 

Then joined as co-founder.
Varun searched a sales community for everyone who'd posted about data enrichment. Found 30 people. Emailed them all.

What he learned: cold email agency owners were the only ones who truly got Clay.

January 2022. They made the call. Sales only.

Nicolae—co-founder, Kareem's partner through two companies and a decade of friendship—departed that year. Stayed on the board. Left on good terms. But an era ended.

They turned on a waitlist that lasted 15 months. Invented the "reverse demo"—customers shared their screen while Clay solved their actual problem live.

End of 2022: $500K ARR. 
End of 2023: $5M ARR. 
End of 2024: $30M ARR. 
Now: $100M.

OpenAI is a customer. So is Anthropic. So is Cursor.

The team runs DJ Fridays, lights off, music on. 
The holiday party featured tarot readings and live Butoh performance.
Kareem calls the culture "chill high achievers."

The spiral wasn't wasted time. It was what finding product-market fit actually looks like.

"Everything in life is a spiral. You come back to the same place, but with a new perspective."

Seven years. Countless loops. $100 million.

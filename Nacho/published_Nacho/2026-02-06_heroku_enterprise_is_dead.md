Heroku Enterprise is dead. 
Salesforce held the bat.

"Sustaining engineering mode." 

Translation: no roadmap, no features, just duct tape until you leave.

They cut 4,000 support jobs this year. Your P1 ticket is about to age like milk.

Trying to hire? "We run on Heroku" now hits like "we're like a family here."

The question isn't whether to migrate. 
It's whether you do it on your schedule or at 2am.

At Stacksync, we connect to any Postgres. Heroku, Railway, Render, self-hosted. 

Your data layer shouldn't depend on one vendor's AI pivot.

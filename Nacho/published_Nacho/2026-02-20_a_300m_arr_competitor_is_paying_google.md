# NACHO — Fivetran Is Bidding On Our Name
## Angle: A $300M ARR incumbent bidding on a sub-20-person startup's brand keyword is the clearest competitive signal in GTM. Let the facts speak.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | Fivetran is paying Google Ads to bid on Stacksync's brand keyword "stacksync." When incumbents start worrying about you, they go defensive with the most they have: money. |
| Topic | A $300M+ ARR competitor bidding on your brand name is the best market validation money can't buy |
| Angle | Nacho's GTM operator lens: defensive ad spend from an incumbent is a scoreboard. Read the signal. Decode the math. |
| Hook Type | Magician (dramatic number contrast: $300M ARR / 1,500 employees vs under 20 people) |
| Story Structure | Evidence (screenshot) → Size contrast → Single insight line → Close |
| Psych Triggers | Underdog (sub-20-person team vs $300M ARR company) + Vindication (market validating through their fear) |
| Visual Format | Image (Google screenshot) |
| Key Visuals | Google search for "stacksync" showing Fivetran sponsored ad above organic results |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
A $300M ARR competitor is paying Google to show up above us.

On our own brand name.

We're under 20 people.

### HOOK B
I Googled our own company name last week.

The first result wasn't us.

It was a $300M ARR competitor. Paying to be there.

### HOOK C
$300M ARR. 1,500 employees. $5.6B valuation.

That company is paying Google to intercept people searching for us.

We're under 20 people. We spend $0 on ads.

### VISUAL HOOKS
**Option A (Recommended):** The raw Google screenshot showing Fivetran's sponsored ad on "stacksync" search. Unedited. The viewer sees the proof before reading the body. Raw evidence = maximum credibility. Matches the hook because the hook says "paying Google to show up above us" and the image literally shows exactly that.
**Option B:** Side-by-side size comparison card: "Fivetran: $300M ARR / 1,500 employees / $5.6B valuation" vs "Stacksync: Under 20 people / YC W24 / $0 ad budget." Reinforces the David vs Goliath contrast from the hook.
**Option C:** Annotated version of the Google screenshot with a callout circling the "Sponsored" label and "go.fivetran.com," with a simple caption: "They're paying to be here." Adds editorial emphasis to the raw evidence.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

A $300M ARR competitor is paying Google to show up above us.

On our own brand name.

We're under 20 people.

I Googled "Stacksync" last week.

First result: a Fivetran ad. Sponsored. "Sync Data Seamlessly." On our brand keyword.

→ Fivetran: $300M+ ARR. 1,500 employees. $5.6B valuation.
→ Stacksync: Under 20 people. YC W24. $0 on ads.

Someone at Fivetran approved a budget line item to bid on our company name.

When the incumbent ignores you, you don't exist. When they start paying to intercept people searching for you by name, you're a problem.

Useful signal for anyone evaluating vendors in any category: incumbents don't spend budget on startups they aren't genuinely threatened by. If you're deciding between data integration tools and Stacksync is on your list, this is why.

Best brand awareness we never paid for.

That's it.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: War-time GTM Operator. Blunt number opening (Magician stun). Arrow bullets for size comparison (Nacho's NetSuite banger pattern). No bridges or transitions needed at this length. Quiet confidence close, not celebration. "That's it." signature. No motivational fluff. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions.
- **Idea Legos**: Magician hook + Evidence → Size contrast → Single insight → Close confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Stun hook (size disparity in 3 lines) → Evidence (Google search, what appeared) → Numbers breakdown (arrow bullets, David vs Goliath) → What it means (someone approved this) → One-line signal read (ignore vs intercept) → Punchline → Signature close
- **Psychological triggers**: Underdog (under 20 people vs $300M ARR / 1,500 employees / $5.6B valuation) + Vindication (the market is validating Stacksync through Fivetran's defensive behavior)
- **Ego bait**: Stacksync team feels validated and proud. Startup founders who've experienced incumbent defensive behavior feel "this is about us too." YC community shares underdog stories. Fivetran employees will NOT want to share this (intentional — competitive, not egobait for them).
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: competitive brand bidding on our name. Single question: "Why would a $300M company care about a team of under 20?" 3-step: Context Lean ["A $300M ARR competitor is paying Google to show up above us."] → Scroll Stop ["On our own brand name."] → Snap Back ["We're under 20 people." — lands after "see more," rewards the tap with the size shock]. "See more" char count: ~79 (Context Lean + Scroll Stop). Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **Traffic driver**: ICP keywords: data sync, Fivetran, integration, competitive, brand keyword
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions. Removed "This is the thing nobody tells you about building in a legacy category." (borderline slop framing). No "Let that sink in" / "Hot take:" / "Read that again." No "Not X. Y." template flip. Arrow bullets for parallel comparison. No performative punctuation.
- **Formatting check**: Phone scroll test: pass. Longest paragraph: 2 sentences. No connectors needed (post is tight enough to flow without them). No text walls.
- **Redundancy sweep**: Passed. Each fact stated once.
- **Reader value**: Incumbents don't spend budget on startups they aren't genuinely threatened by — a useful signal for a buyer evaluating vendors in any category.
- **Word count**: ~125

Most people get cold email backwards
Everyone obsesses over AI personalization

The "hyper-relevant" first line
The "it looks like you just wrote this for me" magic

None of it matters. 
Here's why: if your infrastructure is broken, your message doesn't arrive.

Not in spam. Not in promotions. It simply doesn't exist.

The real order of operations:

1. Diversify infrastructure (SMTP + Outlook + Google accounts — you need all three)
2. Warm up properly before you send anything at scale
3. Obsess over deliverability metrics
4. Then worry about copy 

That's it.
The unsexy work comes first.

Personalization is the last mile, not the first.
But it doesn't sell courses. So nobody talks about it. 

Reliability wins.

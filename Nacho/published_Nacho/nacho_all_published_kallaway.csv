Everyone else in 1999 was doing top-down enterprise sale: 

Six-month procurement cycles.
IT approval. 
Legal. 
Security.

Salesforce went around all of it.

They targeted small sales teams. 
Under 30 users. 
Companies where a manager could sign up with a credit card.

Get the users addicted first. Let them pressure their managers to pay.

By the time IT heard about it, the sales team was already using it every day.

This was considered very weird.
Enterprise software was supposed to be sold to executives.

But Salesforce understood something: users have more leverage than buyers think.

If your product is sticky enough, the users become your sales team.

Siebel was selling $500K licenses to CIOs. 
Salesforce was selling $50/month to sales reps.

Siebel is dead. Salesforce is a $250B company.

Your SDR should be booking meetings. Not managing sequences.

Full stop.

The SDR is not a marketing ops person. Not a data hygienist. 

The SDR books meetings.

Is the other stuff important? Sure. You need good data. You need sequences that work. You need tools.

But to be honest, the basic principle is simple: talk to the people that need what you're doing. That's it.

If your SDR spends 80% of their time configuring tools and 20% talking to prospects, you don't have an SDR.

You have an admin with a quota.

We always try to go the extra mile. If we have to send 200 emails per hour, we'll do 300. But those emails need to lead to conversations.

Not activities. Not ""touches."" Conversations.

The real constraint isn't headcount. It's time spent on things that don't create pipeline.

You can push your body and your mind a lot. You can build the impossible. Every day.

But only if you're doing the right work.

LLMs without proper context are useless.

Product and software teams are designed for context and collaboration.
Even before AI.

Git for versioning.  
Commented functions.  
Declarative variables.  
Declarative ticketing.  
Documentation.

More context. Better data. Better AI. 
That is why they are getting the most out of new models.  

Business teams on the other side. 
More tools, more silos.  
Unstructured data everywhere.  

To improve this, the data has to be connected in a structured way. 
They need a LLM navigation-friendly approach.

My architecture v0.1:

1/ Database synced with your structured data (CRM, ERP, Customer Service). My go-to will be Postgres because of its extensibility.  

2/ Semi-structured data in XML or Markdown. Dump customer interviews, whitepapers, Slack context, raw learnings, emails, etc. Sweet for LLMs. (Or test TOON, a new approach Charly mentioned. Excited to try it soon)  

3. Navigation-ready. I’m using a kind of Zettelkasten system. Two-way synced tags between files that link them together.  

4. Declarative variables and files. Use snake_case for everything.  

5. Git-versioned, so everyone in the company can pull the context in real time and collaborate on it.  

6. Claude Code, and Cursor as the AI agentic layer.

Pro tip: Obsidian to modify your Markdown files. It makes visualization easier.

I’m already experimenting with this. Great results so far.  
I’ll keep you posted.

I went to two conferences in the last quarter. 
Supabase Select in YC HQs and SuiteWorld in Las Vegas.

GREAT value. 
I met super smart and kind people.

The cheatsheet to succeed in conferences is that you have to be human. 
To be more human you have to do less AI work.

So you have to be prepared beforehand.

This is the GTM approach for it.

Pre-event:

1/ Custom landing page for the event. 

2/ Map and register to all the events of the conference beforehand. All the juicy events are the unofficial ones. This is my approach:
	a/ Do a deep research on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity
	b/ Merge them together

3/ Scrape the people that are attending the event and send messages to people that you want to talk to. You can do this on the app of the event + capturing signals like mentions on LinkedIn.

During the event:

This is the most important part. 
You have to be in the moment. 
Be genuine and thoughtful. 

For this you have to get rid of all the possible details missed.

So we have internal tooling to scan the badge. 
Just a photo and it is enriched in your CRM. 
The workflow is very simple:

1/ Tally form with Photo field and Notes.
2/ Photo of the badge, then OCR all the details.
3/ Webhook on orchestration tool we use Stacksync (you can use Clay too)
4/ Enrichment of all the relevant data
5/ Update the CRM and create a task

Post-event:
Follow up as normal with all the context
   
For us, it was HUGE.

That is exactly the problem. 

It can be SUPER good with the correct RAG or Fine Tuning.

Don't get me wrong I am not of those Blockbuster/Keep using your typewriter people. 

I am a MEGA AI nerd. 
I use it daily and I speak with LLMs more than with my family.  

The problem is that if we constantly outsource our writing we are gonna become lazy thinkers aka dumb.

There are two reasons for this:

1/ Stories were and are core for human evolution

The acceleration of evolution in the Homo Sapiens was based on gossiping according to Sapiens (good book btw). 

Gossiping is pure storytelling and storytelling.
It is transmitting emotions and clear message with words. 

Writing is in this scope. So it is a muscle worth training. 

2/ Writing is thinking

To be a good writer you have to be a clear thinker. 
That is why writing is hard because thinking is hard.

Think it as the common question of build vs buy.

This is what Amjad Masad, founder and CEO of Replit mentions on one of his essays. 

“Every build-or-buy decision should be treated with care, but what's certain is that buying tech is strategically fraught because once you run into the limits of the technology, you can't fundamentally change it. But when you build, you'll be able to adapt a lot faster and find ways to win on the tail events—e.g. valuable yet rare use-cases—that are impossible to handle with an outsourced platform.”

This is extensible to the usage of AI. 

Sound counter intuitive. 
But you will need to sacrifice productivity in order to gain long-term productivity.

It’s a paradox. 
AI creates infinite options, which leads to decision paralysis. 
To break the deadlock, we instinctively look for a leader (an expert who can validate our choices)

Why do top consulting firms exist? 
To sell validation. 
Their true value is giving a CEO the confidence to say, ""The experts approve.""

This is the future of software.

We'll be swimming in cheap, AI-generated apps. 
But for the decisions that MATTER, we won't trust a disposable algorithm.

We'll seek out software built on a clear vision, backed by human judgment + AI. We will pay a premium not just for a tool, but for the implied approval that comes from a trusted brand.

The winners won't be the fastest builders. 
They will be the most credible (reliable over time).

Because when creation is free, the only thing worth paying for is the confidence that you're making the right call.

People aren't just using AI anymore, they are beginning to trust it. 
They are absorbing its outputs, letting it shape their opinions, and using it to guide their decisions (even extremelly personal ones). 

This is the most significant strategic inflection point for marketing since the dawn of SEO.

When a potential customer's decision-making process is increasingly influenced by an AI's recommendation, our old playbooks become obsolete. 

The argumentative weight of ""what the AI says"" will soon be undeniable.

This is why we need to champion a new discipline: AEO (AI Engine Optimization).

Think of AEO today as SEO early days. 
It was a niche, misunderstood concept that quickly became the foundation of digital success. 

The question is no longer ""if"" your customers will use AI for purchasing decisions, but ""when."" 

Every time a user asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, or their phone's assistant, ""What's the best software for X?"" or ""Recommend a service provider for Y,"" a judgment is being made.

Not really.

Conversations shared on other websites are being re-indexed by Google.

But...

This is still an excellent opportunity to improve your market research and understand your customers better.

I call it ""ChatGPT Anthropology.""

Here's the 3-step process I'm using:

1. Use this Google search command: ""[your query]"" site:chat.openai.com/share

2. Study the conversations like a digital anthropologist. Look for initial prompts, corrections, refinements, vocabulary, and sticking points.

3. Organize your findings (the stated problem vs. the REAL sticking point).

The magic happens when you see where AI fails people.

The 996 (12 hours/day) is just biased micromanagement. It glorifies meaningless inputs (hours) instead of outputs (value).

The 9-5 is a prison. It implies you only start ""living"" when you clock out.
Don't get me wrong I am not one of those ""sleep when you die"" dudes.
I value my sleep. I value my family time.

But the current models treat humans like machines (996) or like distinct microservices (9-5).

I am a MEGA believer in the Obsession Model. aka The Renaissance Man approach.

There are two reasons why this is the only way to win.

1/ The backlog never stops

Top-tier founders get their best ideas in the shower or while working out.

Why? Because the problem is running in the backlog.

It means your bandwidth is allocated to something meaningful.

When I am with my family, I am 100% there. But the ""Work Thread"" never terminates. It just lowers priority. It waits for a trigger to spin back up.

It is low-latency context switching.

2/ You can only connect the dots backwards

Steve Jobs took a calligraphy class. It seemed useless. Pure ""waste of time."" Ten years later it became the core of the Macintosh.

This is why the ""renaissance Man"" approach works.

Your personal interests, your sports, your ""downtime"". These are the dots. 
They are inputs for the backlog.

Now, I know what you might be thinking.

""Isn't this just Workaholism with better PR?""

No. The difference is ownership (not only for founders btw, you can be a cashier and have ownership).

Sound intense.
It is.

But you need to sacrifice ""balance"" to gain alignment.

Your RAM is limited. SUPER limited.
You can't have this backlog obsession for everything.

Jen Abel has seen the movie (GM Enterprise at State Affairs, co-founder of JJELLYFISH) and she explains the $1M → $10M jump in a way that’sunfair.

I pulled these 8 counterintuitive principles from my notes:

1. Go after tier one logos 

Giants like Walmart or Tesla are early adopters, not slow movers. They need to maintain their #1 position and will take risks to gain alpha.

2. Sell the opportunity, not the problem 

Don't sell ""we have fiber optics."" Sell ""we'll give you one second advantage over your competition."" The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy.

3. Aim for $100K deals, not $10K

A $10K deal growing to $100K is almost impossible to defend. The best clients don't nickel-and-dime because they understand the value they're seeking.

4. Your initial price determines your future 

If you anchor your price too low, you'll ruin your expansion capability. Enterprise companies are accustomed to initial contracts of $75K-$150K.

5. The mid-market doesn't exist

There are only two games: SMB (marketing-led) and Enterprise (sales-led). Mixing them guarantees failure.

6. Hire salespeople who can ""cosplay"" the founder 

The best enterprise salespeople don't seem like salespeople. They can sell the vision and creatively adapt to each client.

7. Every enterprise deal is unique

Standardization works for $10K deals, but each $100K+ deal will be different. It's an art, not a science.

8. Build relationships, not pipelines

Enterprise deals close via text, not email. If a Fortune 10 client calls you, you answer immediately.



This episoder taught me that enterprise sales isn't about rigid processes but creativity: co-creating value with the client instead of selling them a standard product.

If you're paying $4K-$50K/month for your Salesforce sync with Heroku connect here's what changes:

First, Salesforce words: ""maintaining quality rather than introducing new features.""

Translation: product stays on. Investment stops.

And here's what it means for you:

The bugs you have today are the bugs you'll have next year. The limitations you've been waiting on? Not coming.

The numbers: Heroku Connect pricing is row-based. Not published. Negotiated with your Salesforce AE. $4,000/month low end. $50,000+/month for large instances. Add Dynos. Add Postgres hosting. Total cost well above the license.

All for a product in maintenance mode.

The lock-in: Heroku Connect works with Heroku Postgres only. Not AWS RDS. Not Cloud SQL. Not Supabase. Your Salesforce sync and your database are locked to a platform with no roadmap.

Four questions to answer now:

1. How many rows are we syncing? What's our actual monthly cost?
2. One-way or bidirectional? Which Salesforce objects?
3. What does migration to a non-Heroku Postgres look like?
4. What's our contract renewal date?

You should answer them now. While your contract is active and your team has time.

I respect what that team built.
The SQL-to-Salesforce pattern was ahead of its time.

But respect for the past doesn't change the math on your invoice.

We built Stacksync for exactly this. 
Real-time bidirectional sync. Any Postgres. 60-70% less cost.

The real constraint isn't the product. It's waiting until you don't have time to move.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fabianignaciomalpartidanegron_heroku-end-of-sale-hit-last-week-the-team-activity-7426737340561285120-mDcJ?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2PLXsBuFiD1nAi3PAY2nbRbRYGC5K4OKI,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQF6-wNHmkqm4g/feedshare-shrink_480/B4DZxESQiIGQAs-/0/1770672163188?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=L4rCl3Iygpq8uEb5hTBW3vp6oOanhbhxaLdnHwE56ik,True,Heroku_Connect_Nacho,/Users/TERABYTE10/Downloads/Stacksync/04_linkedin_content/Bangers/Heroku_Connect_Nacho.md

Everything else is noise
Here's how we operationalize that:

Speed:
- Bias toward action over analysis
- Ship rough versions, iterate fast
- Kill things that aren't working quickly
- Don't wait for permission to add value

Alignment:
- Everyone knows what matters this quarter
- Incentives point the same direction
- No surprises about priorities
- Constant communication about what's changing

Where teams fail:

Fast but misaligned: Everyone's moving, but in different directions. Lots of activity. No progress.

Aligned but slow: Everyone agrees on what to do. Nobody does it fast enough to matter.

The combination is what works:

Moving fast, in the same direction, with everyone knowing why.

If you're leading a team, ask:
- Are we moving fast enough?
- Is everyone pointed at the same target?

If either answer is no, fix that before anything else.

Seven years to get here. Five of them with almost no revenue.
This is the Clay story:

Kareem Amin and Nicolae Rusan met at McGill in Montreal. 
Both ended up at Microsoft. Both quit to build together.

Their first startup died in under a year. 
Their second hit 1 on the Shopify App Store. 
They sold it five months after launch. 

Kareem still calls that sale one of his biggest regrets.

Clay started in 2017 as a spreadsheet connected to the entire internet. 
The demo felt like magic.

And then five years of almost nothing.

Recruiters used it. Salespeople used it. Engineers used it. 

One customer built their entire NetSuite pipeline on Clay and kept crashing the servers.

Everyone loved it. No one stuck around.

Kareem calls this period ""the spiral."" Commit to salespeople. Get distracted by recruiters. Pivot. Circle back. Repeat. For years.

Two things broke it.

In September 2021, Kareem checked into a 10-day silent meditation retreat. 

He'd been doing Internal Family Systems therapy. On that retreat, he sat with why he kept resisting focus.

""There was something in my psychology that made me feel like we could do anything. When you narrow the scope, it feels claustrophobic.""

He made peace with constraints.

The second thing was Varun Anand. At 18, Varun emailed one of Hillary Clinton's senior advisors ten times before getting a meeting. 

She offered him a job. He spent four years on Clinton's campaign.

Years later, he cold-emailed Nicolae. 

Attended a demo with zero other people there. Started sending Clay companies that became their first paying customers. 

Then joined as co-founder.
Varun searched a sales community for everyone who'd posted about data enrichment. Found 30 people. Emailed them all.

What he learned: cold email agency owners were the only ones who truly got Clay.

January 2022. They made the call. Sales only.

Nicolae—co-founder, Kareem's partner through two companies and a decade of friendship—departed that year. Stayed on the board. Left on good terms. But an era ended.

They turned on a waitlist that lasted 15 months. Invented the ""reverse demo""—customers shared their screen while Clay solved their actual problem live.

End of 2022: $500K ARR. 
End of 2023: $5M ARR. 
End of 2024: $30M ARR. 
Now: $100M.

OpenAI is a customer. So is Anthropic. So is Cursor.

The team runs DJ Fridays, lights off, music on. 
The holiday party featured tarot readings and live Butoh performance.
Kareem calls the culture ""chill high achievers.""

The spiral wasn't wasted time. It was what finding product-market fit actually looks like.

""Everything in life is a spiral. You come back to the same place, but with a new perspective.""

Both are the wrong answer.

Zapier is one-way and breaks at scale.
n8n is better but you maintain it forever.
Custom scripts? Someone babysits that.

The real problem isn't the tool.

The problem is: your GTM stack is blind to your product.

Users sign up. Sales doesn't know.
Users are active. Marketing can't see it.
Users churn. Support had no warning.

That's not an integration gap. That's a revenue gap.

37,2026-02-13,UNKNOWN,5,2,0,7,Teacher,Integration/Data,Data/Numbers,Listicle/Breakdown,Your integration costs more than your integration tool.,"Your integration costs more than your integration tool.

Most companies I talk to spend $30-50K a year on integration software. Fivetran. Celigo. Sometimes Zapier held together with prayers.

That's the small number.

The big number:
- 2 engineers maintaining sync logic: $120K/year (40% of two $150K salaries)
- 1 data quality incident per quarter that takes a week to untangle: $15K in labor
- Features not shipped because those engineers were debugging API rate limits: incalculable

Total cost of the integration: $180K+/year.
Total cost of the tool: $40K/year.

The tool is 22% of the real cost. The other 78% is your people doing work that software should handle.

Companies budget for the tool. They never budget for the maintenance. Then they can't figure out why engineering velocity drops every quarter.

Three signals you're overpaying:
- Your engineers can describe the Salesforce API rate limit from memory
- ""The sync broke"" shows up in Slack more often than ""we shipped""
- You need a human to intervene more than once a month

Cut the tool budget and you save $40K. 

Fix the maintenance problem and you get two engineers back building product.

Especially when B2B companies try to break through the noise. So, what makes one actually work? 

I'm interested because we just witnessed one of the boldest yet.
Depending on who you ask, Matthew McConaughey at Salesforce might be a $10M waste, a tone-deaf move during layoffs, or marketing genius.

It's all of that, and none of it on its own. 
At its core, this partnership is psychological arbitrage. 
It exists to make enterprise software memorable in a world where no one remembers enterprise software.

The McConaughey partnership operates at the intersection of four realities:

The Numbers: $10M annual contract while cutting 9,000 jobs looks terrible on paper.

The Platform: Agentforce needed instant recognition in a crowded AI market.

The Audience: 45,000 executives at Dreamforce who influence billions in spending.

The Result: $100M in annual order value generated, 8,000 companies signed up.

THIS IS NOT CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT. THIS IS ATTENTION ARCHITECTURE.

The same voice that said ""time is a flat circle"" now says ""Agentforce,"" and your brain treats both as profound.

Done well, celebrity partnerships create cognitive monopolies. 
Done poorly (or done for vanity, that is the same), they destroy shareholder value. 

The hiring was controversial because the optics were intentionally jarring. 
But one thing is certain: 

Marc Benioff didn't buy a spokesperson. 
He bought the entire conversation.

They started this partnership year ago we're all still talking about it.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fabianignaciomalpartidanegron_celebrity-marketing-partnerships-get-thrown-activity-7383568932789489664-h6Mg?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADSz6EcBr5PdxSaAY4OnRTn1E4v58Es3gfc,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFZRvaz9pic2g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZne00MXHEAw-/0/1760380012306?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=3uCcunQsXBJUK-4F2I6FR5sxr0CCAVjM_mt5a4cVRao,True,,

Orderful today:
→ $43.9M raised
→ a16z, NewRoad on cap table
→ Former Walmart exec on board
→ 400+ customers (Liquid Death, Koch, Caraway)
→ 10,000+ trading partners

Here's what operators can learn:

1. Consulting is customer discovery that pays you.

Erik Kiser spent 7 years running an EDI consulting firm before building Orderful.
He didn't guess what customers needed. He got paid to learn.

2. Your services clients are your first software customers.

Kiser's consulting clients became Orderful's first users.
Zero CAC. Pre-built trust. Deep workflow knowledge.

3. Cannibalize yourself before someone else does.

Kiser's consulting business profited from EDI being broken.
He built software to make his own business obsolete.

4. Boring markets have lazy incumbents.

EDI is 50-year-old technology. Not sexy.
But incumbents stopped innovating. Orderful walked in.

5. Networks beat products.

Orderful's moat isn't code. It's 10,000+ pre-connected partners.
Connect once. Trade with anyone.

Brian Roberts (former Walmart, now a16z) on the opportunity:

""During my years at Walmart, I saw how critical EDI infrastructure is. This is exactly the innovation the industry has been missing.""

The part GTM operators miss:

This was a data infrastructure play.
NetSuite gets overlooked in GTM. But your ERP data drives revenue, customer health, inventory, renewals.

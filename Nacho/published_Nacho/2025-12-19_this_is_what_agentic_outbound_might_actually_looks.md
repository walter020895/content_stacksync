This is what ‘agentic outbound’ might actually looks like
Clay is now an app inside ChatGPT. 

You can run account/contact research and draft outreach without leaving the chat, using Clay’s research stack (contact databases, enrichment providers, AI research agents).

What you can do in the same thread:

Pull a list of buyers at a target account with verified work emails + context (posts, promotions, open headcount, signals)

Get a person brief (org context, career path, interview/social history, recent activity)

Get a company brief (headcount growth, exec hires, funding signals, leadership statements, tech stack)

Draft an email that references the research (AI spend, hiring trends, social mentions, investors)

Clay says they’re bringing first-party sources next (CRM, warehouse, call recordings) into ChatGPT through Clay as a permissioned bridge

It’s live now.

Enable it from the ChatGPT app directory and connect Clay

This is going to be so much fun.

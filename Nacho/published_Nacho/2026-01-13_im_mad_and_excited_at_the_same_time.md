I'm mad and excited at the same time
Mad because my terminal workflow made me feel cool
And now its over.

Excited because Cowork solves a real problem.

Claude Code was incredible but created a two-tier system in every company.

Technical people got agentic AI. 
Everyone else got chat.

Cowork kills that divide.
Same foundations and task execution.

Just no command line required.

I'll test it this week and share what actually works.

# NACHO — AI Replaces Jobs. Good.
## Angle: AI replacing 99% of jobs isn't a threat. It's a correction. The 1% that survives is performance-based, which is what every job should have always been. The world runs on incentives. If you can't measure output, the role was never real.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | AI replaces 99% of jobs. Timeline unknown. The 1% that survives is performance-based — what jobs should have always been. Founders outwork because incentives are built into the structure. The world runs on incentives. If a job can't be measured by output, it shouldn't exist. |
| Topic | AI doesn't kill jobs. It kills the jobs that were never real. |
| Angle | Nacho's GTM Philosopher lens: this isn't about AI fear. It's about incentives. AI removes the hiding places. The correction was overdue. |
| Hook Type | Contrarian |
| Story Structure | Contrarian Hook → Reframe (performance-based) → Binary (incentives vs. hiding) → Rule → Signature Close |
| Visual Format | Image (bold text card) |
| Key Visuals | Bold text card with high-contrast typography: "AI will replace 99% of jobs. The 1% that survives is what every job should have been." |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
AI will replace 99% of jobs.

Good.

### HOOK B
Everyone's panicking about AI replacing their job.

I'm not.

### HOOK C
99% of jobs will disappear because of AI.

The 1% that survives? What every job should have been in the first place.

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS

1. **Bold Text Card:** "AI will replace 99% of jobs. The 1% that survives is what every job should have been." High-contrast black/white typography, clean design.

2. **Stat Layout Card:** "99% replaced. 1% survives. 100% should be performance-based." Minimal design, three lines stacked.

3. **Quote Card:** "You perform, you eat. You don't, you're done." Nacho attribution, dark background, no logo.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

AI will replace 99% of jobs.

Good.

I don't know the timeline. Twelve months. Thirty-six months. Doesn't matter. It's going to happen.

The 1% that survives is what every job should have been in the first place: performance-based.

A founder doesn't need someone to tell them to work. The incentive is built into the structure. You perform, you eat. You don't, you're done.

Everyone works better with incentives. Everyone. The world moves because of incentives. If you understand that, you understand the world.

Most jobs today exist because nobody built a framework to measure them. People hide in process. Hide in meetings. Hide in "collaboration."

AI removes the hiding places.

Every role should be tied to output. And if you can't design a framework to measure a role's performance, that role shouldn't exist. Not because AI is coming. Because it was never real in the first place.

The correction was overdue.

That's it.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Peak Nacho one-word punch opener ("Good."). Format A from personality guide (one-word punch → explanation). Short sentences, repetition for emphasis ("Everyone. Everyone."), fast-list rhythm ("Hide in process. Hide in meetings. Hide in 'collaboration.'"), concrete binary (perform/eat vs. don't/done), signature closer ("That's it."). No motivational fluff. Pure conviction.
- **Idea Legos**: Contrarian hook + Reframe → Binary → Rule → Close confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (99% replaced — Good.) → Timeline honesty (don't know, doesn't matter) → Core thesis (1% = performance-based) → Founder example (incentive is structural) → Universal principle (world runs on incentives) → The hiding problem (process, meetings, "collaboration") → One-liner rehook ("AI removes the hiding places") → Rule (can't measure it = shouldn't exist) → Correction framing → Signature close
- **Psychological triggers**: Tribal Identity (founders and operators who already think in incentives feel vindicated) + Validation (hard workers feel seen — the world should reward output)
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: AI replacing jobs. Single question: "Why is that good?" 3-step: Context Lean ["AI will replace 99% of jobs."] → Scroll Stop ["Good."] → Snap Back [body reveals the reframe — it's about incentives, not fear]. "See more" char count: ~35 (Context Lean + Scroll Stop). Fits mobile preview: yes, with room to spare.
- **Traffic driver**: ICP keywords in hook: AI, jobs. Broad reach topic for founders, CTOs, operators.
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions. No blacklisted phrases. No "Not X. It's Y." template — the "Not because / Because" pair reads as natural Nacho correction. Quotes around "collaboration" are an eye-roll voice marker, not AI scare-quoting. No buzzwords. No performative punctuation. No arrows.
- **Word count**: ~160
- **Factual sources**: No external claims. Post is pure conviction/opinion. "99%" is the user's stated belief framed as personal prediction, not cited research.

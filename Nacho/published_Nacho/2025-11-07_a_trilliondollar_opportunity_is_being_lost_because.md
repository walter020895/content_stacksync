A trillion-dollar opportunity is being lost because of LLM context.


LLMs without proper context are useless.

Product and software teams are designed for context and collaboration.
Even before AI.

Git for versioning.  
Commented functions.  
Declarative variables.  
Declarative ticketing.  
Documentation.

More context. Better data. Better AI. 
That is why they are getting the most out of new models.  

Business teams on the other side. 
More tools, more silos.  
Unstructured data everywhere.  

To improve this, the data has to be connected in a structured way. 
They need a LLM navigation-friendly approach.

My architecture v0.1:

1/ Database synced with your structured data (CRM, ERP, Customer Service). My go-to will be Postgres because of its extensibility.  

2/ Semi-structured data in XML or Markdown. Dump customer interviews, whitepapers, Slack context, raw learnings, emails, etc. Sweet for LLMs. (Or test TOON, a new approach Charly mentioned. Excited to try it soon)  

3. Navigation-ready. I’m using a kind of Zettelkasten system. Two-way synced tags between files that link them together.  

4. Declarative variables and files. Use snake_case for everything.  

5. Git-versioned, so everyone in the company can pull the context in real time and collaborate on it.  

6. Claude Code, and Cursor as the AI agentic layer.

Pro tip: Obsidian to modify your Markdown files. It makes visualization easier.

I’m already experimenting with this. Great results so far.  
I’ll keep you posted.

Got big inspo from the triple Js:

Jordan
Joe
Jacob

This is the future for business teams.

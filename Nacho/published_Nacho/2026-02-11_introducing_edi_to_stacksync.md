Introducing EDI to Stacksync 🚀


Onboarding a single trading partner through EDI takes 4-8 weeks. 
One partner. One connection.

Companies avoid adding new partners because the integration cost is too high.

Electronic Data Interchange(EDI). Purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, inventory updates. It's been the B2B standard for decades.

The problem:
- Onboarding one trading partner takes 4-8 weeks
- Troubleshooting takes days. Visibility is close to zero
- Every partner uses different formats. X12, EDIFACT, custom
- Mapping logic is brittle. One schema change breaks the flow
- Most companies depend on consultants who profit from the complexity

The result: companies avoid adding new partners because the integration cost is too high. Growth gets blocked by plumbing.

We built an EDI service at Stacksync. Cloud-based. Supports X12, EDIFACT, and custom formats. Central partner management. Compliance-ready for healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.

# NACHO — Siebel Told the Market They Were Scared
## Angle: The post isn't about Salesforce's genius. It's about what Siebel's reaction revealed. When the market leader panics over actors on a sidewalk, they tell every prospect the startup is real. Wartime GTM: 40 people, no budget, Siebel's panic was the campaign.

## IDEA LEGOS
| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| User's Insight | Salesforce hired actors to protest Siebel's conference in Feb 2000. Siebel overreacted by parking 3 semi-trucks (blocking their own signage) and calling the police. The overreaction made it national news. 1,000+ orgs signed up in 2 weeks. Siebel did Salesforce's marketing for them. |
| Topic | Siebel's panic turned a sidewalk stunt into Salesforce's biggest marketing win |
| Angle | Nacho's GTM Philosopher lens: the story is about what Siebel's reaction REVEALED to the market, not about Salesforce's cleverness. Wartime close: 40 people, no budget, the competitor's panic was the campaign. |
| Hook Type | Teacher (Story → Signal reading) |
| Story Structure | Hook (Siebel signaled fear) → Setup (what Salesforce actually did) → Siebel's overreaction → Results (press, signups, revenue) → Close (wartime GTM framing) |
| Visual Format | Text-only (story post) |
| Key Visuals | N/A |

### HOOK A (Recommended)
Siebel told the market they were scared of Salesforce.

They didn't mean to.

### HOOK B
40 people. No marketing budget. Salesforce needed the entire market to hear about them.

So they made Siebel do it.

### HOOK C
Salesforce's biggest marketing campaign cost almost nothing.

Siebel's panic paid for the whole thing.

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS

1. **Newspaper Headline Collage:** WSJ, Forbes, Business Week, NYT logos with the Salesforce "No Software" crossed-out logo in the center. Caption: "February 2000."

2. **Before/After Stat Card:** "Salesforce FY2000 to FY2001. Revenue: $5.4M to $22.4M. Customers: ~100 to 3,500. Marketing budget for the protest: almost nothing."

3. **Quote Card:** Benioff quote from Behind the Cloud: "This stunt worked across many fronts: we built morale, got great press, and brought our competitor's customers to our event." Clean design, no logo.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

Siebel told the market they were scared of Salesforce.

They didn't mean to.

February 2000. Salesforce was 40 people. No real marketing budget. Siebel was the dominant CRM company in the world.

Benioff hired actors to protest outside Siebel's user conference in San Francisco. Red t-shirts. "No Software" signs. A fake TV crew interviewing confused attendees.

A sidewalk stunt. That's all it was.

Siebel parked three semi-trucks in front of the convention center to block the protesters.

The trucks blocked Siebel's own signage.

Then they called the police.

On actors.

Wall Street Journal wrote about it. Forbes wrote about it. Business Week called Salesforce "the ant at the picnic." The New York Times picked it up.

Within two weeks, more than 1,000 organizations signed up for Salesforce.

PR Week named it "Hi-Tech Campaign of the Year."

That fiscal year, Salesforce went from $5.4M to $22.4M in revenue. ~100 customers to 3,500.

40 people. No budget. Siebel's panic was the entire campaign.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Nacho's GTM Philosopher lens. Not retelling history for history's sake. Reading the competitive signal: Siebel's overreaction told the market Salesforce was real. "On actors." standalone line is peak Nacho short-punch. Close combines B (signal) + C (wartime) angles.
- **Idea Legos**: Teacher (Story → Signal reading) confirmed. No forced framework. The Nacho layer: "They didn't mean to" + "On actors" + "Siebel's panic was the entire campaign" are all observations, not prescriptions.
- **Narrative arc**: Hook (Siebel signaled fear, unintentionally) → Context (40 people vs. CRM king) → Setup (actors, signs, fake TV crew) → Minimizer ("A sidewalk stunt. That's all it was.") → Overreaction (trucks, own signage blocked) → Escalation ("Then they called the police. On actors.") → Results (4 publications, 1,000+ signups, award) → Revenue proof → Close (wartime reframe).
- **Psychological triggers**: Schadenfreude (Siebel blocked their own signage, called police on actors) + Underdog (40 people, no budget vs. dominant CRM company).
- **Ego bait**: Salesforce community feels proud. GTM operators and startup founders see wartime validation. Early-stage founders who feel outgunned on budget see a model.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: Siebel's unintentional signal to the market. Single question: "How did they tell the market without meaning to?" 3-step: Context Lean ["Siebel told the market they were scared of Salesforce."] → Scroll Stop ["They didn't mean to."] → Snap Back [body reveals the protest and overreaction]. "See more" char count: ~70 (both lines fit). Fits mobile preview: yes.
- **Traffic driver**: ICP keywords: Salesforce, CRM, GTM, marketing, enterprise, Siebel.
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions. No blacklisted filler. No "Not X. Y." flip formulas. No forced takeaway. "They didn't mean to" is conversational, not template. "On actors." is a Nacho-style short punch, not an AI pattern.

Let's make SDRs be SDRs again.

Your SDR should be booking meetings. Not managing sequences.

Full stop.

The SDR is not a marketing ops person. Not a data hygienist. 

The SDR books meetings.

Is the other stuff important? Sure. You need good data. You need sequences that work. You need tools.

But to be honest, the basic principle is simple: talk to the people that need what you're doing. That's it.

If your SDR spends 80% of their time configuring tools and 20% talking to prospects, you don't have an SDR.

You have an admin with a quota.

We always try to go the extra mile. If we have to send 200 emails per hour, we'll do 300. But those emails need to lead to conversations.

Not activities. Not "touches." Conversations.

The real constraint isn't headcount. It's time spent on things that don't create pipeline.

You can push your body and your mind a lot. You can build the impossible. Every day.

But only if you're doing the right work.

PS. I know SDRs that wake up and go straight to the phone. 
Boom. Boom. Boom. Ten Hours straight if needed.

Pick up the phone. That's it.

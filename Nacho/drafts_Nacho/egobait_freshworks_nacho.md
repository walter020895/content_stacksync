## IDEA LEGOS

### Lego 0 — Insight (World Knowledge)
Zendesk raised prices 60-300% in 2010. Customers revolted on Hacker News. One comment said "there's a huge opening for someone to take all of Zendesk's customers." A VP at Zoho in Chennai read it, quit his comfortable job, rented a 700 sq ft warehouse, built Freshdesk, got 100 paying customers in 103 days (first one: Australia, 9,000 km away), got called "a freaking ripoff" by Zendesk's CEO (best marketing ever), and built the first Indian SaaS company to IPO on NASDAQ at $13B peak valuation.

### Lego 1 — Topic
Freshworks' origin story. How one Hacker News comment became a $13B GTM lesson.

### Lego 2 — Angle (Nacho's Lens)
War-time GTM operator seeing the purest market signal: customers revolting against an incumbent. Girish didn't run a focus group. He read the signal — a competitor overcharging and users saying so publicly — and moved before anyone else. 103 days to 100 customers is operator speed. The Zendesk rivalry is a GTM masterclass in turning enemy fire into positioning.

### Lego 3 — Hook Architecture
See HOOK OPTIONS below.

### Lego 4 — Story Structure
1. **Setup:** Zendesk price hike (60-300%). Customers revolt publicly.
2. **The Signal:** One Hacker News comment identifies the gap
3. **The Move:** Girish quits VP role, rents warehouse in Chennai, builds Freshdesk
4. **Speed:** 103 days to 100 customers. First customer in Australia (9,000 km).
5. **The Rivalry:** Zendesk CEO's "freaking ripoff" tweet → ripoffornot.org → viral
6. **Payoff:** First Indian SaaS NASDAQ IPO. $13B peak valuation.
7. **Closer:** The best market signal is an incumbent overcharging on a captive base.

### Lego 5 — Psychological Triggers
1. **Underdog** — Chennai warehouse, comfortable salary given up, 9,000 km from first customer
2. **Schadenfreude** — Zendesk's attack backfired. "By attacking us they put us in the same plane as themselves."
3. **Pattern Recognition** — Incumbent pricing backlash = market entry signal. This pattern repeats across SaaS.

## HOOK OPTIONS

### HOOK A (Recommended) — Operator Principle (Insight First)

```
Every pricing revolt is someone else's pitch deck.

In 2010, Zendesk raised prices 60-300%. One Hacker News comment: "huge opening for someone to take all of Zendesk's customers."

One person in Chennai read it. 103 days later, 100 paying customers.
```

**Why this works:** Leads with Nacho's operator principle — the RULE first, then the evidence. "Pitch deck" is operator language. "Every" makes it universal, not just one company's story. See-more test: "Every pricing revolt is someone else's pitch deck." shows before fold — it's a blunt claim that demands proof. Snap back (103 days) delivers the proof. This is Nacho's "blunt headline first → evidence" structure from his bangers.

### HOOK B — Contrarian (Rivalry-Led)

```
Zendesk's CEO called Freshdesk "a freaking ripoff."

It was the best marketing Freshdesk ever got.
```

**Why this works:** Drama. The confrontation is visceral. "Best marketing ever" flips the insult. High viral potential. Risk: starts with conflict, not context. Works better for people who already know the companies.

### HOOK C — Teacher (Outcome-Led)

```
A Hacker News comment built a $13 billion company.

Girish Mathrubootham read it from Chennai. He was 36, VP at Zoho, two kids in school.

He quit the next month.
```

**Why this works:** "$13B from a comment" is an arresting claim. Naming Girish immediately grounds it. "He quit the next month" creates urgency. Risk: slightly less operator-focused than Hook A.

- **Right panel (#0043CE bg, white text):** Freshworks logo (white, full) / "103 days" large / "0 → 100 customers" / "$13B NASDAQ IPO"
- **Divider element:** Small Hacker News "Y" icon at center line, with tiny text: "huge opening for someone to take all of Zendesk's customers"
- **Image-hook loop:** Two logos in opposition — one grayed, one bright → hook reveals the connection: a Hacker News comment bridged them → second look at the panels: the grayed side created the opportunity, the bright side seized it in 103 days

- **Image-hook loop:** Girish's face + "a slap on my face" creates intrigue (what slapped him?) → hook reveals the Hacker News comment and Zendesk pricing revolt → second look: "slap" wasn't an insult, it was a wake-up call that created a $13B company

### Option C — Timeline

- **Format:** PORTRAIT 4:5 (1080×1350)
- **Asset tags:** [DATA][LOGO][SVG]

  - **Oct 2010:** "Freshdesk launches — 700 sq ft warehouse, Chennai" (blue)
  - **Jan 2011:** "100 customers in 103 days" (blue, slightly larger)
  - **Dec 2011:** "Zendesk CEO: 'FREAKING RIPOFF'" (red accent)
  - **Sep 2021:** "NASDAQ IPO — $13B" (blue, largest text)
- **Logo:** Freshworks, bottom-right
- **Image-hook loop:** Timeline shows acceleration from pricing mistake to IPO in 11 years → hook fills in the human drama (comfortable VP, two kids, warehouse) → second look: you trace the line from one Hacker News comment to NASDAQ and realize the whole thing took 103 days to ignite

## FULL POST

Every pricing revolt is someone else's pitch deck.

In 2010, Zendesk raised prices 60-300%. Customers revolted on Hacker News. One comment said it plain: "There's a huge opening for someone to take all of Zendesk's customers."

Girish Mathrubootham read it from Chennai. He was 35. VP at Zoho. Mortgage. Two kids in school. He had every reason to close the tab.

He called that comment "a slap on my face."

To be honest, most operators would have bookmarked the thread and gone back to their jobs. Girish quit. Rented a 700 square foot warehouse. Built Freshdesk.

103 days later, 100 paying customers. The first was a school in Australia, 9,000 km away. Nobody told them about Freshdesk. They found it on their own.

Then the market leader publicly attacked a startup in a warehouse. Zendesk's CEO tweeted: "WAIT-WHAT-A-FREAKING-RIP-OFF."

Freshdesk didn't flinch. They built ripoffornot.org. Put the CEO's tweet on the homepage. Let users decide.

Girish: "By attacking us they put us in the same plane as themselves. From that point on we never let go of the slot."

First Indian SaaS company to IPO on NASDAQ. $13B peak valuation.

Zendesk was taken private for $10.2 billion. Freshworks is still public.

The opening was there for anyone. Girish just moved first.

## POST QUALITY REVIEW

### 1. Connectors
- "He had every reason to close the tab." — Scene-placing. You can PICTURE Girish at his desk, looking at the browser. Makes the biographical fragments (35, VP, mortgage, kids) into STAKES by showing what he almost didn't do. Bridges facts to feeling.
- "He called that comment 'a slap on my face.'" — earned, Girish's own words. Micro-dialogue that bridges from HN comment to personal decision.
- "To be honest, most operators would have bookmarked the thread and gone back to their jobs." — Nacho's operator judgment. Creates CONTRAST before "Girish quit."
- "Then the market leader publicly attacked a startup in a warehouse." — David vs Goliath reframe. Scale contrast before the tweet.
- "Freshdesk didn't flinch." — earned, courage under fire before the ripoffornot.org reveal.
- "Zendesk was taken private for $10.2 billion. Freshworks is still public." — power reframe. Devastating.
- No generic connectors.

### 2. Repetition
- "Zendesk" appears 4x — necessary (price hike → market leader → CEO tweet → taken private). Each mention adds new info.
- "Freshdesk/Freshworks" appears 3x — building → responding to attack → still public.
- Power reframe ADVANCES beyond the hook principle.

### 3. Logical Jumps
- Operator principle → Zendesk price hike → customer revolt → HN comment → Girish reads it (personal stakes: 35, VP, mortgage, kids) → "every reason to close the tab" (SCENE — the moment of choice) → "slap on my face" → BUT most would have ignored it → THEREFORE Girish quit → 103 days, 100 customers → "They found it on their own" (PROOF of organic demand) → ESCALATION: market leader attacks startup in warehouse → BUT Freshdesk didn't flinch → Girish quote (strategic framing) → NASDAQ IPO → POWER REFRAME: Zendesk taken private / Freshworks still public → closer
- Key move: "He had every reason to close the tab" turns biographical facts into a CHOICE. The reader feels the weight of what he risked BECAUSE the tab-closing scene makes it visceral.

### 4. Structure
- "He had every reason to close the tab." — standalone after biographical fragments. Turns a list into a moment.
- "103 days later, 100 paying customers." — time compression + payoff.
- "They found it on their own." — standalone fragment.
- Power reframe is its own paragraph.
- Closer compressed to 2 sentences (cut one redundant line).
- Reads clean on mobile. No paragraph exceeds 3 lines.

### 5. Slop Check
- Zero em dashes
- Zero "Not X. Y." patterns
- Zero colon staging
- Zero arrow/emoji bullets
- Zero "Here's the thing" / "Let that sink in" / "Here's why it matters"
- Zero LinkedIn templates

### Word Count: ~205
### Hook Type: Operator Principle (Insight First → Evidence → David vs Goliath → Power Reframe)
### Tone: Operator admiration. Nacho's voice comes through in the blunt opener ("Every pricing revolt is someone else's pitch deck"), the operator judgment ("most operators would have bookmarked the thread"), and the clean closer ("Girish just moved first"). "He had every reason to close the tab" is the new emotional anchor — it turns résumé facts into a scene of decision. Speed + signal-reading + courage celebrated. The power reframe is the devastating ending that makes this more than a biography.
### EgoBait Score: VERY HIGH
- Freshworks employees see their David vs Goliath origin celebrated with details that make them PROUD
- "The market leader publicly attacked a startup in a warehouse" — the scale contrast employees SCREENSHOT
- "Freshdesk didn't flinch" + ripoffornot.org = the courage story employees WANT to share
- "Zendesk was taken private. Freshworks is still public." — ultimate vindication
- "They found it on their own" validates organic product quality from 9,000 km away
- Indian SaaS community engages hard with NASDAQ IPO framing
- Opener is a shareable business principle — operators screenshot it
- Girish quoted directly, credited as the hero
- Numbers throughout: 60-300%, 103 days, 100 customers, 9,000 km, $13B, $10.2B
- UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE: ripoffornot.org, "same plane" quote, Zendesk taken private vs Freshworks still public

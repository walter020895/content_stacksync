Your CMO should be the best storyteller at your company. 

Full stop.

That's my bias, but I'm sticking with it.

The CMO is not the CFO (crazy, right?)

The CMO should be company's best storyteller.

Is the other stuff important? Of course it is. You need metrics. You need reporting. You need data. You need so many things.

But if you don't nail the story to your market, a clear POV, and true differentiation -- none of the other stuff will matter.

And if the CMO can't get the company (internal team) excited and rallied around the company mission, how will you ever be able to get strangers (customers) onboard?

The most valuable asset in any company is its story. And the CMO must be the chief custodian of that story. 

Not a bean counter. 

Not a data wrangler. 

A storyteller.

(my opinion)

A CMO who cannot craft a compelling story - who cannot articulate a clear point of view or highlight what truly sets the company apart - will find that all the data in the world won’t move the needle.

PS. This is more important now than ever. In a world of AI slop and sameness and customers who don’t actually believe your claims in marketing - you need a strong POV and great storytelling.

After two years running our business as COO, I’ve promoted Dan ","I’m excited to share an important update about the leadership structure at Exit Five.

After two years running our business as COO, I’ve promoted Dan Murphy to CEO. 

My role as Founder & Owner does not change; more on that in a bit. 

This promotion isn’t a shift in how we operate — it’s a recognition of the role Dan already plays in our business and a critical step in preparing us to scale and maximize our potential in the years ahead.

In the book Traction they talk about the ideal pairing between the Visionary (Founder) and the Integrator (Operator).

That describes the partnership Dan and I have well:

• Visionaries are creative, strategic, restless, full of ideas, often bald - and honestly a bit dangerous without the right counterpart. They are known to start fires and run.

• Integrators bring structure and process. They turn chaos into clarity. They run the business, manage teams, keep the trains moving, and allow the Visionary to focus where they are most valuable. That’s exactly what Dan has done since joining two years ago.

Dan has pushed me. He challenges every late night and weekend idea. He puts out the fires that I start. He sweats every dollar we spend. And he has consistently held a higher bar for what this company can be. Even if it's sometimes annoying and I want to yell at him :) That's what we need. That's the partner you want.

Exit Five has gone from “Dave’s cute little solo business” to a real company with real scale because of the structure, stability, and leadership he has brought to us.

His growth over the last two years — from VP Marketing in his last job to a true operator today — has been incredible to watch.

Like in baseball free agency, you get paid for the job you've already done. So this title as CEO reflects who Dan has become and what our company needs for the future. 

We have big plans for 2026, 2027, and beyond. 

I am working harder on this than I have on anything in a while and having the most fun of my career.  Splitting up the CEO and Founder roles will make us all more successful for the future.

My superpowers are vision, content, product, and strategy. Working on copy, hooks, headlines, positioning, storytelling, and training our team to do the same. 

The best role for me at Exit Five is to be editor-in-chief and raise the bar on our ideas, our content, products, and the way we show up in the market. That’s where I can create the most value.

This move gives us the foundation we need for a more ambitious Exit Five — one with more impact, more innovation, and more opportunity for our team.

Please join me in congratulating Dan on a well-earned promotion to CEO of Exit Five. 

This is an amazing milestone for our little business, and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.

NOTE: He started wearing the fanny pack before becoming CEO. But that's how I knew it was meant to be.

Also, this means I am now in full-time #FounderMode for those keeping score at home.

Congrats Dan!",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davegerhardt_foundermode-activity-7402662282985570304-08qE?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAF0xL_oByCbKvMWnw2gqp5d9JJD_HZczzDg,2025-12-05T10:57:03.078Z

In March 2021 I started writing a weekly newsletter, Growth Unhinged, where I’d reveal the unexpected playbooks behind the fastest-growing startups. 

Since then it’s turned into one of the most trusted resources on the topic, reaching 78,000+ subscribers and 4 million+ annual views.

What many folks didn't realize: over the past 4.5 years, the newsletter has been a side project. It’s something I’ve squeezed in alongside a full-time job as a VC operating partner.

Well, that's about to change. Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/eZ8VjFQE

My aspiration is to become a modern version Gartner or Forrester designed specifically for B2B startups. Growth Unhinged will bring you fresh benchmarks, original research, in-depth case studies, and tactical how-to guides to help you go from product-market fit to category winner.

I’ll spend 50% of my time on research and writing. And I’ll spend the rest working directly with startups & scaleups around the topics I write about: pricing & packaging, AI monetization, GTM strategy, funnel optimization & product-led growth.

This leap into the unknown is only possible because of the support of this community. I don’t take it lightly.

Thank you again for being part of the journey. Now let’s get even more unhinged 🍻

Last week, I sold all my remaining shares in Refine Labs to existing shareholders and a private investment firm for an undisclosed amount.

This marks the close of a chapter in my life and career that I will always look back on with deep appreciation for the journey, pride in what we built, and excitement for what’s next, for both Refine Labs and me. 

When I started Refine Labs from my South Boston apartment in 2019, I had three freelance customers, no employees, and $3,000 in my bank account. No investors. No social media presence. No impressive resume. Just a vision:

-To create the place where future B2B CMOs are forged.
-To design growth systems for the most iconic and emerging brands in SaaS.
-To push the boundaries and move the industry forward.

Refine Labs became exactly that. And far more.

To the current and former Refine Labs team - thank you. You brought the vision to life with relentless excellence, care for our customers, and a commitment to innovation.

To Gaetano DiNardi - co-hosting 100+ live shows together changed the trajectory of this company and helped thousands of GTM pros level up.

To Megan Bowen - your integrity, leadership, and unwavering commitment over the past five years have been the foundation of our culture and growth. Thank you.

To everyone who attended Demand Gen Live, tuned into the podcasts, or followed the journey on LinkedIn: your support has meant so much to me. 

I’m proud of everything we accomplished together. 

Over six years, we partnered with 250+ leading SaaS companies. 

We helped forge a new wave of CMOs who are both strategists and tacticians. 

Refine Labs alumni have gone on to lead Marketing teams at top brands or build companies of their own. 

Thousands of podcast listeners used the insights to get promoted, reimagine their careers, and drive impact in their orgs.

I’m excited for the future, both for me and for Refine Labs. 

Refine Labs will continue to operate and deliver for customers as it always has, with the same team, same leadership, and same customer focus. I’ll be cheering from the sidelines.

And for me, I’m turning the page. A new chapter is beginning. Just like when Refine Labs was only a vision, I’ve started seeing something new for what the future holds and how I can contribute. I’ll share more in time.

For now, I’m just grateful.

To every team member, customer, listener, and supporter—thank you. We made something really special.

The best is yet to come. Here’s to the next era.

monday.com includes quick 60 second videos explaining exactly why to buy its Standard & Pro plans. And I'm loving it so much more than the static pricing page!

Your product team probably built a detailed matrix on what features go in what tier so they could build out all the right feature permissions and settings.

Did that feature matrix get dumped on your pricing page as-is, leading to confusion and eye-rolls across your target buyers? Be honest.

Don’t dump that on the pricing page. Tell a story about what the customer can do with the feature.

And perhaps take a page from monday.com's playbook.

C","If you only read one post about marketing this week it should be this one.

We are drowning in AI slop.

But I am going to throw you a life jacket.

ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, this agent or that. It's all great. But here's what you really need to know about the craft of marketing.

• People do not care about your company.
• They don't care about your product and your features.
• They don't care about the new integration you just shipped.

What they care about is themselves. 

We are biologically wired to be selfish.

So: if you can talk to someone about themselves, you’ll have their full attention.

Focus on helping them first.

What is the selfish benefit to them? Why should they care?

Here are five timeless principles you can think about for your customers:

1. Make Me Look Good

Whether it’s to a boss, their team, or their industry, people are wired to care about status. Can you help them impress someone? Can you give them an edge? Can they copy/paste your idea and look smart in the next meeting? I remember impressing my boss when I was 23 year old marketer being asked to build a marketing plan for a product launch for the first time. I had no idea what to do, found a great resource from HubSpot blog (the OG) and used it. She was impressed.

2. Save Me Time

Time is the one thing nobody has enough of. If you can help someone do something faster, with less friction or fewer steps, that's the way. People will pay for time savings. BUT they have to believe this. Can't just be a marketing claim. You need proof. Show the receipts. The examples.

3. Make Me Money

Capitalism seems to be the best system that exists in the world. I don't make the rules I am just observing. It doesn't seem like someone has created a better way, so yes - money matters. And whether they will admit it or not, your customers want to make more money (because they are people). Whether directly or indirectly, people are tuned in to ROI. If you can help someone drive revenue, get more leads, reduce churn, or land a raise then you’ve got their attention. Again though: MUST BE BELIEVABLE. So you must have PROOF.

4. Help Me Avoid Pain

We are wired to avoid pain. We'd almost always rather avoid pain than get some type of gain. No one likes to look stupid, feel behind, or get in trouble. If you can speak to something they’re secretly worried about -- a mistake, a missed goal, a clunky process -- and show a way out, they’ll lean in.

5. Help Me Reach The Next Level

Great marketing often speaks to ambition. Career growth. Mastery. Confidence. People want to feel like they’re getting better — at their job, in their life, as a person.

***

There's a lot of noise in marketing right now because of tech/AI, but I'm more bullish than ever on understanding the timeless principles in marketing, and that starts with understanding people.

I hope these are helpful for whatever you're working on right now.

With your help, I've spent the past three months investigating what's actually happening in SaaS & AI monetization -- not just what's making headlines. And I've collected data from more than 240 software companies.

I'm so excited to finally release the findings. See for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/ePsQJT6X

Six takeaways from the new Tremont | Growth Unhinged State of B2B Monetization report:

1. Seats & flat-rate pricing are increasingly under threat.

The rise of AI, and AI agents in particular, means value gets decoupled from customers needing to buy more seats. And the costs of delivering AI means software companies need a mechanism to protect themselves if & when AI usage spikes.

2. As AI continues to gain traction, hybrid has become the ‘it’ pricing model.

Seats and flat-rate pricing are being replaced by hybrid pricing, i.e. combinations of subscriptions and usage. Hybrid pricing is up from 27% to 41% adoption (!) in the last 12 months.

Software and AI are becoming inseparable. More than half of survey respondents said they include AI capabilities as part of their core software product offering.

3. There are a seemingly infinite number of ways to structure hybrid pricing. Choose wisely (or support multiple models).

Software founders used to tell me their pricing was inspired by Salesforce or maybe Slack. Now they tell me they were inspired by Clay. Clay's hybrid model has multiple routes to expand customers while keeping pricing (relatively) simple: more features (subscription packages) and more usage (credits).

4. Outcome-based pricing is seen as the 'holy grail'. It's still out of reach for 95% of the market.

A mere 5% said their pricing model is outcome-based right now. But 25% said they expect to have outcome-based pricing by 2028. 

5. The shift toward pricing transparency seemed inevitable. This isn’t playing out.

My two cents: many software companies, especially early-stage and AI companies, don't have pricing totally figured out. And as soon as they publish pricing, it gets way harder to adjust.

6. Pricing models keep evolving. Most of the market is unprepared to keep up.

Be careful to avoid pricing ‘no-man’s land’ -- this happens between $5-20M ARR when ownership often falls through the cracks.

Public SaaS companies ended Q1 with an estimated average gross margin-adjusted CAC payback period of 57 months based on data from Jamin Ball / Clouded Judgement (link in comments). Said differently, it takes the BEST companies nearly five years to recover their sales & marketing spending. Five years!

Zero public companies ended Q1 with a CAC payback period of less than 12 months. Only five were under 24 months (Digital Ocean, AppFolio, Atlassian, Olo and Q2). Meanwhile, 24 reported either a CAC payback period above 100 months or negative net-new ARR added.

Perhaps more troubling, this isn’t some extreme outlier quarter. It’s not something we can continue to blame on ‘the macro’ or external events. 

The average CAC payback period over the past twelve quarters is now 41 months. CAC payback periods haven’t been healthy since Britney Spears’s conservatorship ended in 2021!

Public companies can usually afford for their GTM to be inefficient in the short-term. They have plenty of profitable legacy customers who can subsidize sales and marketing. And they can sneak in a price increase or two (or three) to squeeze even more from these folks. 

But the subsidies can’t go on forever. And a reckoning could be on the horizon.

AI isn’t what’s coming for software GTM jobs, at least not yet. The real villain is GTM inefficiency. But AI might just be what saves them.

Forget AI. You need timeless lessons if you want to grow your career in marketing. 

Here's my list that I created based on growing my career from PR intern to CMO:

1. Forget acronyms (MQL, ABM, blah blah blah you don't need it)
2. The story is the strategy 
3. Think hard about “offers” 
4. Push your team past incremental thinking 
5. Get on the same page as sales 
6. Don’t “be” finance and ops...partner with them 
7. Master internal communication 
8. Articulate the strategy 
9. Think short-and-long-term 
10. Understand what the CEO cares about 
11. Make hiring your job, not a side project 
12. Create your own momentum 
13. Your job is to get the job done 
14. But do the job first, before hiring externally 
15. Get comfortable making bets without perfect data 
16. Spend the budget (all of it, or else)

I wrote all of these lessons down and share more in detail here, if you want to grab the full deck of my 16 lessons going from PR intern to CMO, here:

When every activity is not measured by the exact ROI of that activity... you are actually able to do good marketing.

You'll be able to do things that stand out, generate awareness, capture attention, build trust, create loyalty, and maybe for once actually get people sharing things about your brand.

Word of mouth is the most powerful thing a brand could have. But you don't get it when ringing the cash register is the desired outcome from every brand touch point.

OK, but how? 

Everyone always wants to know how. 

Because inside of the company, the CFO wants to know how much everything costs. The VP Sales is on your ass about the leads. The CEO is standing up in front of the board next week and she needs to show growth.

You have to educate people on how good marketing works.

I have a ton of product ideas; but I have no idea how design and engineering work. 

So they have to explain that stuff to me.

Same is true in marketing. I believe it is a true skill, a craft. And when deployed properly, it's a strategic growth lever for the business.

Is it not worth having a strong POV on what great marketing looks like? 

To teach your company, to earn the trust of the CEO, CFO, VP Sales, board, internal teams? 

You must be able to articulate what good looks like and why marketing is not just direct response.

Now of course the dream scenario is you find out the CEO gets marketing before you join the company and you don't have to do as much of this ... but you might not always be in that position (or have control to get that information, or know it's real, etc.)

But if you didn't think part of the job in marketing was to educate people on how good marketing works; then it might be better to switch careers and become an engineer, show up to work at 10 AM and code silently in the dark until 7 PM and go home. 

OK that little paragraph was unnecessary. Literally no reason for engineers to catch strays from my LinkedIn post on this fine Thursday.

But anyway... my point is this:

Internal marketing is the most underrated marketing channel; I did not make this rule. 

I am just giving you my observations from my career. 

I'm still doing calls weekly with CEOs and Founders advocating for marketing; they still need education.

It's part of the job.

How do you educate your peers about how marketing works? Not in a patronizing way, but explaining how customers get information, how they buy, why the long game matters?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davegerhardt_please-dont-get-mad-about-this-but-heres-activity-7407381622724980738-4XHm?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD0I0qgBC_ob3spBi0gOcg7LEDgj2HKVHDE,2025-12-18T11:30:01.353Z

In lock step. 

To drive momentum and success for the company.

Not enough about Product and Marketing. 

There should be a vision. And a roadmap. And regular launches. Some small. Some big. And this becomes the operating system for the company. 

You can CREATE momentum for your company by doing this. Deadlines drive actions. 

These regular launches give Marketing and Sales regular opportunities to talk to new customers.

For context, I write a newsletter about startup growth and monetization called Growth Unhinged. I also work with tech companies 1:1 as an advisor and consultant.

1. Y'all haven't gotten tired of me (yet). 

After 10+ years of posting on LinkedIn, I just crossed 100,000 followers (although I'm not sure how many of y'all are AI bots). The newsletter passed 500 paid subscribers in December. 

While that might sound low, it’s on track to hit 6-figures in subscriber ARR this month! (For folks interested in pursuing the creator path, you don’t need a massive audience to have a successful business.)

2. I'm resolving to make 2026 the year of upleveling what I'm doing.

I got tired of complaining about the limitations of Substack now that I'm more serious and finally did something about it. I switched over to beehiiv on December 31st and honestly I wish I had done it sooner (I also signed up beehiiv as a newsletter sponsor!). 

It felt like Substack stopped innovating for writers and decided to become a closed social media platform instead. Now that I’m on beehiiv I’m taking more control of the newsletter look and feel, improving deliverability, collecting better data about readers, learning what an API key is, setting up automations, and no longer paying a 10% Substack tax. I’m also excited to try some of their newest features: digital products, podcast pages, an AI website builder, and 🔥 website analytics. 

This shift will let me invest more in community, events, and personalized experiences in 2026.

You can see beehiiv for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/epTX3QBQ

3. I’m still working on more premium offers to make paid subscriptions a no brainer without alienating free readers.

My first offer: subscriber-only perks on top GTM tools, up to $37,067 in savings for only $150 per year. Next up: special in-depth reports (including an upcoming AI x GTM report) and new ways to bring the community together.

4. I'm realizing I'll probably never be satisfied. But that's what pushes me to get better.

Someone else will come up with a brilliant idea I wish I thought of (and had written about). I'll spend a bunch of time on a post that flops. Growth never feels fast enough. 

No matter how well things are going, I'll always aim higher. I'm trying to make peace with that rather than obsess over the business 24/7. (In the meantime, sorry to those who've become my de-facto business therapists!)

Since 2020, I've been focused on building at the bleeding edge of AI and GTM as the OG GTM Engineer...

Most of that work has been speaking to other in-the-trenches practitioners, not worrying about leaving folks behind.

Today, I'm so happy to announce that Topline Media to the world... a chance to bring some of my ideas to GTM leaders around the world and not just to those on the bleeding edge.

Some stats from the team:
1. Today it takes 8000 attempts to get 1 real customer meeting.
2. It takes dozens of meetings to close a deal.
3. And then 40 months of revenue to break even on that deal.

We need actual practices to get out of this steep decline... a media outlet that is about documenting building, not talking heads.

I'd suggest you subscribe as my goal specifically when I contribute is to translate what is happening at the bleeding edge actually building workflows (Claude Code, APIs, data workflows, PVPs, PQS, my love of vertical SaaS and why) to folks who want to experiment there.

So you'll see me talk about topics like...
1. Why ICP and TAM scoring lead you way astray, and what to do instead
2. The horizontal SaaS company thought trap, and how to escape
3. The exact steps to build a useful GTM engine from absolute 0

First off an enterprise yearly","Today I am pardoning all you turkeys that say Clay is expensive… 

Here’s how to NEVER PAY more than $800/mo for Clay.

First off an enterprise yearly subscription to Clay with CRM integration is under $9k/year and your cost is 1.5 pennies or $0.015 per credit.

This means you can enrich 600,000 companies (1 clay credit), profiles (1 clay credit), or use a great AI search model like 4o mini for you guessed it… 1 Clay credit. And they are good all year if you pay yearly, so you don’t lose Clay credits.

Not to mention formulas (free and an amazing hack), live domain checker (free), job changer signal that only charges for results not checks (so cheap).

Okay, but Jordan, what about those things that cost 20 or 40 or 100 Clay credits… we are spending so much.

Well this is called a convenience tax… where your sheer laziness costs you. 

This last week I paid like $300 for an eye exam when an in-network provider would have been $0… but it’s just because I didn’t want to like go figure out my Byzantine eye insurance.

I paid a dumb convenience tax, but I’m not blaming the ophthalmologist, I chose to do this.

Enter Clay’s API BYK program and HTTP API integration. 

The Bring Your Key API program lets you pay clay ZERO EXTRA DOLLARS and just enter in your own API key and Clay EATS THE pass through costs. 

So scraping a webpage becomes so cheap (less than 1/10th of a penny) with Zenrows. 

Or use Claygent with your own OpenAI API key and only pay for tokens, Clay gives you the scraping ON THEM.

Clay is making money hand over fist NOT because they are trying to rake people over the coals, but because no one wants to take the 1-2 hours to configure their account to save so so so much money.

So use Clay credits like points (e.g. job changers is where you get SO MUCH for your buck because you aren’t charged for searches just results) and don’t use Clay for mobile phone enrichment as a direct API key will work best.

Stop complaining, there’s no other tool that makes it easy to NOT pay them.

You’re just committed to spending as a way to not understand what you’re buying.

And, sadly, you’re doing a great job burying your head and opening up your wallet needlessly.

Contact me, I’ll teach you how to save money.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_today-i-am-pardoning-all-you-turkeys-that-activity-7399477092955914240-V9pS?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEPLVB8BjK8i7C_59z_zkiamiJYzSeuohxk,2025-11-26T16:00:14.597Z

One of the greatest crimes of remote work: having to sit in front of a screen and do video calls all day. 

Here's a perk for you to consider for your team: trade as many video calls for phone calls as you can. I'm serious. This is not a bit. We need to cut back the need to be on video, it's too much.

If we can make it a phone call, let's do that.

","New data from 6,525 SaaS startups: It’s easier to get into Harvard or Stanford than it is to reach $25 million ARR within 10 years. Let that sink in.

I'm pumped to announce that I've partnered up with ChartMogul as their Analyst-in-Residence (fancy title, huh?), which means I get to dig into their 🔥 dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years & share it with you.

What I found: 
 - Almost half of software startups do eventually make it to $1 million ARR after they’ve started monetizing -- if they’re willing to stick around.*
 - One-in-five make it to $5 million ARR. 
 - One-in-ten make it to $10 million ARR. 

Yet just one out of every fifty startups makes it to $25 million ARR within 10 years. The odds of doing this (2.3%) are lower than getting accepted into Harvard or Stanford (3.6% acceptance rate). 

If you’ve done it, I hope you take a moment to celebrate. 97.7% of your peers didn’t get this far. (And that doesn’t even factor in the scores of startups that never start monetizing a product in the first place!)

*Worth mentioning is that this data is based on a 10-year period, meaning it looks at companies that launched & started monetizing in 2016 or earlier. The full report will include data on more recent cohorts!

Maja and I asked our communities about their favorite B2B GTM tools in 2025 including which were ""most impactful"" and which are ""must try"". 195 software GTM leaders weighed in. (And Gemini sorted through 1,000+ open-ended responses 🤯.)

ChatGPT topped the list of most impactful tools with 50 write-ins. They were followed by OG HubSpot (40 write-ins) and breakout unicorn Clay (30 write-ins). This list included tried-and-true tools you're probably familiar with like LinkedIn, Gong, Notion, 6sense, Canva, Figma, Apollo & ZoomInfo.

Things got more interesting on the ""must try"" list. GTM leaders are trying out vibecoding (Lovable - 2nd, Replit - 5th, Magic Patterns) and AI agents (n8n - 3rd, Relay.app, Dust). Folks are also on the lookout for more & better tooling for advanced GTM plays (see: Clay, Keyplay, Unify).

If the ""must try"" list is any indication, we're eager to graduate beyond ChatGPT to more advanced AI use cases. But 2025 is still the year of AI experimentation vs. true impact.

Yeah can you imagine???

Because I pride myself on not being a hater (personally) and let me just say that
LinkedIn has made me more connections than X or IG or YouTube or Facebook combined. 

Meaningful connections. 

That translate to IRL. 

Candidates. Teammates. Partners. Friends. 

It’s influenced millions in revenue. AND I don't have to worry about seeing someone get shot when I open up LinkedIn, so that's a positive too.

Also, this platform is completely free. So I have nothing to say about the algorithm. That's their choice.

An old friend of mine DMd me last week and said ""I used to think it was so cringey that you posted on LinkedIn but now I get it; what a huge advantage you have.""

Introducing the inaugural 2025 State of B2B GTM report. Maja Voje & I teamed up to bring you objective data into what's working in GTM right now and where is AI honestly making an impact. It's based on data from 195 B2B companies, mostly SaaS and hybrids of SaaS & AI.

Get the full report in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/ea_zYUzB

The five takeaways you need to know:

1. There are six main GTM motions in B2B. Inbound is the most popular, but not by much. 

As much as people love to hate on Outbound, don't count it out. 37% of B2B companies rely on either Outbound or an Account-Based GTM.

Intent-based outbound is the 2nd most popular channel in terms of where teams plan to increase GTM budget in 2026. Outbound! (The 1st is AI discovery.)

2. 2025 was a year of (endless) exploration. The average software company says they have 5 core GTM channels and another 5.5 GTM channel experiments.

This is, frankly, too 👏 da** 👏 many 👏 channels for a $1-10M ARR business!

3. 2026 needs to be the year of ruthless scaling.

The single best channel in terms of likelihood of having an impact surprised me: intimate events.

The first-ever GTM scorecard can help prioritize where to place your bets (see the full report 👀).

4. Everyone uses AI, relatively few see real GTM impact.

Three-in-four GTM leaders said they have top-down pressure to adopt AI. But the impact of AI is a mixed bag. More than half (53%) said they see either no impact or limited impact from AI. 

The disillusionment was most acute around AI SDRs. In the words of one survey taker, “We tried an AI SDR for six months and were unable to generate a single opportunity.” Ouch.

5. The new GTM tech stack is mostly ChatGPT?

There’s been a proliferation of next-gen GTM tools. Only one, ChatGPT, is having a breakout impact.

ChatGPT was rated the #1 most impactful GTM tool with roughly 50 write-in mentions. The closest alternative was OG HubSpot, which had about 40 write-in mentions. Clay came in third with nearly 30 write-ins.

Because life is too short.

I know other companies are out there grinding right now. 9-9-6 is what it takes.

We ARE changing the world.

We ARE the most important company that's ever been built.

Family, friends, hobbies, health - that's all stuff that can wait.

Because right now we have a window of opportunity and we must capture it.

We must win this war.

We must go for the home run. The grand slam. The Hail Mary. 

We'll pull the goalie if we need to.

War references. 

All of them. In every internal deck.

Something about Tom Brady in his late 30s to every new hire during onboarding.

Let it be known to my competitors: I will not settle for anything less than $1B revenue and pure global dominance in the B2B marketing space.

So no, I am not taking the day off today (or tomorrow) and having ""Thanksgiving"" -- one day my wife and kids will be ""Thankful"" that I didn't.

That's my plan for Thanksgiving.

There’s a ton of posts circulating about the LinkedIn algo. But it all just changes so much. And I’m pretty confident (completely making this up, I have no idea) that no one really knows what’s going on. There’s been - for years - some basic features LinkedIn should have built for creators but they never come, and the way vertical video works is a perfect example. It just … makes no sense. Is anyone paying attention?

SO: my two cents. The only thing you can control is putting out interesting content. I’ll never whine about the algorithm. There’s nothing I can do about it anyway.  

But I can try harder, write better, find new angles. I’d like to think it’s still a meritocracy. 

I’d also remind you that we are all renting space here, and it could all be wiped out at any time. 

Find more channels. Build an email list. Use LinkedIn to move people from here to something you can own.

And just 1-in-1,000 reach $10 million in less than a year 🤯

When you listen to VCs, you get the impression that revenue growth happens at warp speed. 

I partnered with ChartMogul as their Analyst-in-Residence, which means I get to dig into their 🔥 dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years & share it with you.

What I found: For startups that reach $1 million ARR, it usually takes between two and five years from initial monetization. 

1️⃣ A mere 3.3% of startups reach $1 million in under 1 year
2️⃣ 13.4% reach $1 million in under 3 years
3️⃣ 25.1% reach that figure within 5 years

You can map yourself onto the curve below to find the figures that are most relevant to you including $1 million and $10 million ARR milestones.

My two cents: I think this is healthy! 

It takes real time to find product-market fit (PMF) and move from founder-led sales to repeatable growth. Premature scaling can kill an otherwise great business. 

Many of the best companies go slow to go fast: (a) Lovable spent 18 months building before their breakthrough success, (b) Clay grinded for 6 years before seeing revenue traction, (c) bolt.new's parent company spent 7 years clawing their way to $700k in ARR before their new product exploded.

For context, I write a newsletter about startup growth and monetization called Growth Unhinged. I also work with tech companies 1:1 as an advisor and consultant.

1. I thought free subscribers would stall out when I introduced a paid tier. The opposite happened.

Subscriber growth actually accelerated and the newsletter passed 80,000 this week.

2. Demand for the paid tier has been solid & the newsletter cracked the Top 100 business bestsellers on Substack! 

But about half my subscribers are on monthly plans and I’m worried about what churn could look like. I need to create more premium offers to keep folks sticking around (very open to ideas!). 

I’m also getting disillusioned with the limitations of Substack now that I’m more serious. It feels like they want to be a social media platform more than they want to create tools for creators. (I’m considering beehiiv in case folks have opinions!) 

3. I was worried about being lonely and losing motivation. So far that hasn’t been an issue. 

I carve out Mondays to hang with CJ and Ben Hillman & record our new Mostly Growth pod. I carve out Wednesdays for in-person meetings in Boston. Writing happens in the morning and I try to stack advising meetings in the afternoon.

Collaborations with other creators have been a big boost. Other writers are kinda like my chosen co-workers. (Shoutout to Maja for the partnership on our first State of B2B GTM report & our constant WhatsApp messages about 🐕)

4. I haven’t been this stressed out in a while. 

Everything falls to me. When I drop the ball I can’t blame anyone else. And I’m constantly making decisions I’m not confident about.

Some of this is probably natural with trying to start a business & run a business at the same time. Some of it is self-inflicted. My main action item is getting better at saying no (I’m re-reading Lenny’s great piece on this for help.)

5. My dog has never been happier or more demanding. 

When I head out for a cold brew, he expects to make a stop at the dog bakery. (How can I say no to this face?!)

This is from Jacob Bank, founder & CEO at Relay.app, who finally got around to putting his AI agents into an ""org chart"" and it's super cool to see.

I sat down with Jacob to unpack exactly how he did it – and how you can do it, too. The TL;DR:

👉 AI agents have spiky intelligence and can be surprisingly powerful for marketing tasks.

👉 Modern teams will have hundreds of AI agents in the org chart for every one person.

👉 While that sounds complex, each individual agent is much easier to build than you think.

👉 There’s power in building your own personal AI agent stack that’s specific to your goals and style of working. (This stack is also something you can bring to future roles.)

To let relationships lapse because work is busy.

But man, it’s a hell of a gift to be here, to be alive, to healthy - and for what it’s worth, it’s usually the guy that doesn’t have all 3 things I mentioned above that’s giving the advice that you can’t have them all at once.

The same thing I’ve been saying f","CONFIRMED WITH DATA: Paid social lead gen on Facebook & LinkedIn is terribly inefficient and provides very low ROI.

The same thing I’ve been saying for 6 years, now confirmed in a MASSIVE data set.

Metadata released their second B2B advertising benchmark report and the results are….ummmm….not good.

But this is an absolutely groundbreaking data set for B2B companies. Especially given the scale:

$42MM in total advertising spend
236,000 total “leads” collected
And all of the associated downstream data for pipeline & conversion rates

Here’s the breakdown and my analysis of the data set:

1. 90% of advertising dollars were spent on lead gen campaigns ($37MM of $42MM total spend)

This is consistent with what I see in my own analyses of over 100 companies. B2B companies primarily use paid social for lead gen campaigns because of the outdated demand waterfall models & requirements for digital touchpoint-based attribution.

2. “Download” was the most popular CTA indicating that B2B companies are still using paid social to drive downloads of gated PDFs (shhheeeesh!).

The average cost was $126 to get someone to maybe open the PDF.

3. Based on the data, I estimate the lead-to-win % to be 0.3%. That means Sales needs 333 “leads” to win 1 deal, which is terribly inefficient.

This is consistent with what I see in my own analyses - average lead-to-win rate I see is somewhere between 0.1% - 0.2%, meaning Sales needs 500-1000 paid social “leads” to win a deal. The Metadata report is similar and confirms these inefficiencies in a very large sample size.

4. Low cost per lead does not indicate actual success.

The average cost per “lead” was $172 across all lead gen campaigns. But given the very very very low win rate of these leads, we estimate advertising CAC to be $57,000 to win one deal. This is just the advertising cost and doesn’t include Sales headcount, SDRs, marketing headcount, or other marketing programs such as events. It’s safe to say this performance is totally unacceptable.

5. Estimated advertising CAC payback period is estimated to be 21 months.

$38MM in total advertising spend on lead gen campaigns resulting in $22MM in closed won revenue.

This is just the advertising cost and doesn’t include Sales headcount, SDRs, marketing headcount, or other marketing programs such as events. When you include all the other expenditures, you could reasonably estimate the total CAC payback on these programs is more than 48 months (meaning it takes 4 years just to pay back the cost of acquiring the customer, not adjusted for gross margin)

____

There is FINALLY sufficient data to say definitively that almost all B2B companies should STOP running lead gen campaigns on LinkedIn & Facebook.

1. Commit

You must be committed to executing on the right activities for a sustained period of time. Most companies fail at this because they do 3 podcasts & give up when they don’t get any “leads”.

2. Identify Your Subject Matter Expert(s)

Provide forward-thinking, relevant information that your buyers *want*. Most B2B marketing content doesn’t hit because the person creating the content isn't an expert and doesn’t deeply understand the buyer.

3. Content Creation Framework

Put pillars in the ground that help you create content on a recurring basis. Example: we host Tik Tok Live every Tuesday and bi-weekly live Revenue Strategy events. These pillars create raw content. We have 3 total recurring pillars.

4. Post-Production framework

Things that are celebrated on this platform as “impressive”:

-Raising tons of money
-Hacking the algorithm for likes and followers 
-Bragging about your MRR or metrics to look “successful” 
-Pretending to be generous by giving away your e-book or AI workflow when you’re actually manipulating people 
-Grinding for 80+ hours a week chasing external validation
-Getting rich while bankrupting your health, relationships, creativity, and peace of mind

Things that are actually impressive: 

-Showing up with pure intentions
-Waking up every day and genuinely loving your life 
-Holding empowering beliefs about yourself and others 
-Knowing who you are and following that authentically 
-Doing “work” that fuels you instead of drains you 
-Building on your terms, from clarity instead of control and urgency
-Trusting your intuition and doing what’s right for you

In the 1950s, cigarettes were seen as stylish and glamorous. Every Hollywood star and celebrity was lighting up. Now we know better.

The things this platform celebrates as glamorous are just as destructive, but now it’s your mental health, your purpose, and your freedom that are at risk.

I had to learn these lessons the hard way. You don’t have to.

Personally, my list only has ONE tool and it's because 99.9% of my time is spent with my friend ChatGPT. Just strolling through the woods in Vermont talking to my little robot. I know, I know.

But we happen to run the top community for a huge group of marketing professionals, so I took to the streets (aka the message boards) to ask the Exit Five community their most used AI tools right now.

No affiliations with any of these companies, not getting paid to post this; truly a finger on the pulse type of thing - here are the 15 tools that come up the most in Exit Five right now.

1. ChatGPT / Custom GPTs

The catch-all workhorse. Campaign names. Research. Outlines. Internal playbooks. If you haven’t already: build a brand-trained GPT that gives you 20 campaign name options in seconds. Helps me go from 0 to 1 faster. Get the bad ideas out of the system.

2. Claude

They say it's better for long documents and repurposing. Drop in your last year of content and get a pattern analysis you definitely weren’t going to do manually. I just like the name. Claude.

3. Canva Magic Studio

Canva rocks. When you need designer-level output… without a designer. Spin up carousels, ads, and visuals in minutes. Even makes me look good.

4. Descript

Edit video like a doc. Cut filler. Pull clips. Export. Done in a fraction of the time.

5. Perplexity

Your research intern. Competitor tracking. Trend scans. Summary + sources.
Great when someone Slacks you “quick question” and you need to look prepared. Do you all like this better than Google? Than ChatGPT? It's different? How

6. SurferSEO

SEO briefs and optimization that make ranking feel less like a gamble. Great name btw.

7. Ahrefs + Frase

Find old posts losing traffic. Patch the gaps. Win back rankings.

8. Make

Lead routing and follow-up workflows that run while you sleep.

9. Zapier (+ Agents)

Reporting, notifications, cross-tool workflows. Everything that used to require ops help.

10. Clay

List building and enrichment on autopilot.
Find contacts. Pull data. Build prospect lists that would've taken days.

11. ElevenLabs

Voice cloning for audio versions of your content. You type. “You” talks. I want to use this for our podcast ads but I think the real mean sounds more authentic?

12. Vercel V0

Landing pages that practically build themselves, with auto A/B tests baked in.

13. Flourish

Data visuals and interactive maps that make your spreadsheet look like a crime scene. Uh. OK? Is that a good thing?

14. GenSpark

Upload data. Get insights and a deck. No more begging for analytics support.

15. NotebookLM

Drop in transcripts, internal docs, and case studies. Get messaging ideas, customer language, objections, topics - all from your own data.

I think that the ""back to the office"" crowd often has a narrative that remote work is easier.

That remote workers are slacking off while the ""real professionals"" are grinding it out in the office.

But I think there's another angle to this:

Working from home exposes everything. No boss watching over your shoulder. No colleague pressure. No artificial energy from office chaos. Heck, you could be ripping the vape pen all day at work if you wanted to.

Remote work makes it more about the results (and I like that, btw)

You can't hide behind being the office social butterfly who everyone loves but whose output is average. Maybe you're fun, funny, amazing to get a coffee with - but not actually doing any real work??

Remote you can't mask weak skills with great small talk or being the person who always organizes the lunch order. But he's so nice! So fun to be around! 

Well as it turns out Todd sucks at his job...

Remote work kills the performance theater, which was always one of my biggest beefs of office culture.

Don't get me wrong - there's value in being together. I feel it every time we get our team together and there are times that I wish we all DID work together in an office.

But let's be honest about what also happens in offices: 

• People spending three hours looking busy instead of productive. 
• People hang around the office until a certain time vs going home when the work is done for the day
• People getting promoted (or hanging around at a company longer than they should) because they're likable, not because they are delivering results.

The truth? Both can work. But they demand different skills.

Remote rewards discipline. Focus. I need to take a shower and put on real clothes to remind myself that this is work - even though it's remote.

I don't think the remote work is for everyone. 

It requires a certain level of self starter, get shit done, can you show up and make things happen on a day when you don't have any motivation.

Editor's Note: I am also extremely biased toward remote work during this phase of my life (in my 30s, with young kids, etc.) 

The office was the absolute best place to be in my 20s and I am sure a few years from now when my kids don't need me as much and aren't around as much, I'll be making my way back to an office of some kind.

Remote work.

Tons of smart, experienced people argued with me and told me I was an idiot. 

5 years later, it’s common knowledge that most high-volume lead gen Marketing models are ineffective, inefficient, and not financially viable. 

I knew for sure it wasn’t working because I had analyzed 20+ B2B company’s CRM data and saw the same consistent pattern at every one:

1. 90%+ of Marketing program budgets spent on Lead Generation strategies 
2. Marketing gets thousands of MQLs and celebrates $100 cost per “lead” 
3. “Leads” convert to customers at 0.1% 
4. 1,000 SDR follow up cadences to Close 1 deal 
5. 5-10+ year CAC payback periods 

IT WAS OBVIOUS. 

But nobody had taken the time and critical thinking to look at the data this way across a broad range of companies to see the clear, obvious pattern. 

It took YEARS for smart people to understand the nuances of my message. Thousands of people changed their careers and lives by recognizing the opportunity early and taking action. Others lagged behind for years. And now 5 years later everyone sees it as common knowledge.

____

And at this moment right now, the same thing is happening. 

At Passetto, we’ve analyzed 50+ B2B companies' CRM, revenue, and financial data. 

The traditional GTM model is broken - super inefficient and entirely unsustainable. But the METRICS companies use blind them to this reality. And the METRICS companies use unknowingly keep them handcuffed to this broken model - decimating growth rate, GTM Efficiency, and enterprise value creation. 

And again, smart, experienced people are criticizing my message and disparaging me for it without taking the 30 minutes to understand my message and all of the supporting data. 

IT’S OBVIOUS. 

The only way to fix it is to change the GTM KPI stack and the Financial Planning process. Which then drives organizational alignment, investment allocation, and department-level accountability downstream. 

I’ve seen this story before. 

Maybe it will take 6 months, 12 months, or a few years for everyone to see this reality. But in a few short years, this will also be common knowledge :)

-Changing marketing goal","B2B Companies have been talking about Sales & Marketing misalignment for more than a decade. They’ve tried to solve it with:

-Changing marketing goals from MQLs to SQLs (didn’t work)
-Putting a Chief Revenue Officer in charge of Marketing (didn’t work) 
-Having a weekly pipeline meeting (didn’t work)
-Buying an ABM platform (didn’t work) 

B2B companies always try to fix GTM at tactical execution (let’s hire a new growth marketer to do SEO for us) or tech & tools (let’s buy an ABM platform and change from MQLs to MQAs). 

They do this because it’s easy but it doesn’t solve the real problem. It’s superficial & visible. It’s easy to report back to the board in a powerpoint slide about a new tool or a new tactic.

But the real root cause of these issues is so much more fundamental. It’s deeply rooted & invisible.

The real root cause is the operating model & data model that companies consciously or subconsciously adopt that drives the mindset of executives, investors, and GTM teams, and influences every decision they make.

Lead -> MQL/MQA -> SAL -> SQL -> SQO -> Closed Won

And here are the core issues:

1. Operates in an assembly line of silo’d departments instead of an allbound integrated revenue team.

2. Evaluation of the ROI and Impact of investments are made in silos by each department (Marketing, Sales, SDRs) instead of within a Unified GTM model.

3. There are no commonly accepted KPIs and ""attribution"" strategies for Demand Creation, so the entire GTM team doesn't focus or invest here, leaving the entire GTM engine highly imbalanced & inefficient.

4. Most companies use a model that was created between 2012 and 2017, despite how much has changed in the world in the past 6 years.

5. Marketing is optimizing for MQLs/MQAs or a poor definition of “pipeline” that doesn’t align to close won revenue. The data is clear in every Salesforce instance that core Marketing KPIs don’t align to closed won revenue, sales velocity, and marketing ROI. 

6. SDRs optimize for SQLs or meetings, not closed won revenue. 

7. All of the technology, tools, and tactical “best practices” are built around getting leads, MQLs/MQAs, and SQLs, further entrenching companies getting stuck in the model. 

8. GTM teams are stuck in the incremental. How do we improve our outbound connect rates by 1%? How do we reduce our cost per lead by $3? There are no breakthroughs in growth with incremental improvements. Optimizing a broken model is not the solution, it’s changing the model. 

9. No standardized data model so every company reinvents the wheel in RevOps w/o clear, performance-based definitions. Everybody on the GTM team is looking at different metrics & decisions are based on experiences and opinion instead of science & data.

When you are putting together your 2024 plan, use these ideas as a guide. Clearly identify the core issue(s) that are holding you back. Create a solution that actually solves the root cause, instead of treating the symptoms.

I’ve tracked my performance and habits for more than 5 years using WHOOP and in my data it’s super clear:

Alcohol is one of the worst things you can do to limit your performance - both physically and mentally. 

There’s a shift happening in Austin, TX and I’m sure it’s happening in other parts of the World as well, where lots of people are choosing to abstain from alcohol. 

There’s starting to be less of a negative stigma around not drinking alcohol, thankfully. It's crazy that for so long it's been socially weird to *not* drink alcohol, despite the clear, obvious data about the negative effects. 

In the business World and in lots of B2B companies I’ve worked at before, “Culture” revolves around alcohol. 

Let’s get everyone drunk at Sales Kickoff so people can bond. 

Let’s have a networking event at a bar. 

Let’s do a happy hour for business development. 

Let’s all go out to the club in Vegas and then be hungover in the tradeshow booth all day tomorrow. 

Hopefully more companies and the business World at large start to shift away from this outdated social norm. 

__

I'm not sure this is a forever thing for me, but it's definitely working for me right now. 

When I make changes in my life and start to feel a lot of positive momentum, I always keep it going. 

Lots of people say the positive effects continue to grow the longer you abstain from alcohol. I'll continue to report back on my own personal experience. 

Anyone else trying this? Seeing this shift? What's been your experience?

And the way to get there is by focusing on *business KPIs* 

TTM Growth Rate %
GTM Efficiency % 
Total Pipeline Created
Total Investment to Create Pipe 
Pipeline Opp Win Rate 
Investments to Create Pipe : Total Pipe Created

And boom: you'll get a clear picture that aligns everyone in GTM on the current performance and historical trends. 

Example $100MM ARR SaaS Company:

Growth rate: 24% (decent growth)
GTM Efficiency: 428% (highly inefficient)
Total Pipe Created: $48MM
Total Investment to Create Pipe: $27.6MM
Pipeline Opp Win Rate: 8% (down from 12% YoY)
Pipeline:Spend Ratio : $1.74 (really bad) 

You don't need to build a multi-touch attribution report. Or split the credit between ""Inbound"" and ""Outbound"". Or debate how much ""brand value"" is created from all the trade show booths. None of it. 

This performance is abysmal and unsustainable. If continued for several more years, this company will undoubtedly crash and burn. Alarms should have been going off at the Exec level and Board level for the past 4+ quarters. 

Yet, the Marketing QBR reports show increasing MQL performance, great cost/MQL, and an overly complicated influenced revenue report that shows how well everything is working (yet nobody really understands). 

All of the Marketing reports are built by Managers and Directors who have little to no visibility into the broader business context - that growth is slowing and CAC has inflated by almost 3X in the past 6 quarters. 

__

As a Finance or GTM Executive, you cannot rely on bottoms-up department-level reporting to build and optimize your GTM. Instead, you *must*:

1. Align on a Unified set of GTM KPIs that don't rely on attribution 
2. Start with Investor Level & Financial Level KPIs, particularly growth rate and GTM Efficiency % 
3. Break the investments and performance down across the customer lifecycle (not by the GL / Dept code) 
4. Analyze the performance, historical trends, and unit economics across each core phase of the customer lifecycle. 
5. Rapidly identify the biggest issues and opportunities to unlock growth and ROI.
6. Map and track strategic priorities against BUSINESS KPIs (not attribution)

Then, with all of this BUSINESS CONTEXT. You can start to run custom diagnostics with W-shaped attribution, or linear, or signal-based, or sliced by GEO / segment / vertical or anything else to answer specific questions you have based on the business KPIs. 

Always look at attribution data with a purpose based on business-level KPIs.

- ICP-fit accounts & contacts are sourced using Clay, Sales Nav, Cargo 🧱 and ChatGPT
- All data gets pushed to Salesforce

2️⃣ Aware

- Accounts get warmed up with LinkedIn paid ads, scaled email, LinkedIn connections and referrals – in addition to other bespoke tactics and campaigns
- They are flagged as aware if buyers start engaging via email (2+ contacts with 2+ email opens), accept LinkedIn connections, visit the website, or engage in the community
- Tools: website tracking (Clearbit, HubSpot), email & LinkedIn automation (Apollo, Outreach, La Growth Machine), community (Slack)

3️⃣ Interested

- Accounts progress as they demonstrate more meaningful engagement & intent
- Key signals include visiting high-intent website pages (ex: pricing page), starting a free trial, attending an event, etc.
- Tools: webinar (Sequel.io), trial (Redshift), website tracking, product usage data, ETL

4️⃣ Evaluating

- All of the above is meant to generate high intent, ICP pipeline for sales
- Accounts progress here by booking a meeting with sales or requesting a demo
- This is where more manual, high-touch outreach comes into play (aimed at warm accounts)
- Tools: meeting routing & booking (Calendly), marketing automation (HubSpot)

The big learnings over the past 8 months:
 - Content & offers are everything for getting a response
 - Not all triggers are created equal when scoring account stages
 - The data won’t be perfect, don’t let that stop you
 - The best GTM plays involve both marketing & BDRs

This is what a focused GTM looks like. Marketing, sales, CS, product and even ops all play a role in building pipeline with the right accounts. Huge shoutout to the Parabola team (Alex Yaseen, Ben Pollack, Adam Reisfield) for taking folks behind-the-scenes!

PS, Parabola just launched a game-changer for anyone interested in automating workflows like ABX stages (think Cursor for Ops teams). You can check it out here: https://parabola.io/

That’s what a Director of RevOps told me yesterday. ,"“We don’t use agencies or consultants because I had a bad experience with one several years ago”. That’s what a Director of RevOps told me yesterday. 

It’s like saying you’re never going to a restaurant again because one time you had a bad meal. 

I used to think the same way when I was young, naive and inexperienced. I took so much pride in thinking I knew everything and could do it all myself. 

But then in 2013, despite me arguing against it, the company I worked for hired a Strategic Marketing Consultant named Andy and it fundamentally changed my career. 

Andy taught me all the really important things about Marketing that most people don’t talk about - how to conduct customer interviews, how to create a business case, how to run a beta trial, how to build a differentiated strategy using product, price, distribution, and promotion all together. 

Then again in 2017, the company I worked for hired a Category Design Consultant named Robin who taught me everything about category design, positioning, narrative design and strategic communications. 

Then again in 2018, the company I worked for hired a Creative & Branding agency who totally transformed our website, sales decks, and advertising assets and taught me everything I know about the creative process and how much it matters in properly communicating your message to the market. 

A lot of my skills, experience, and success in entrepreneurship can be directly attributed to these experiences working with external experts that taught me specialized knowledge, processes, and ways of thinking. 

___

External experts (agencies, consultants, fractionals, etc.) have distinct advantages that simply can’t be replicated by in-house employees:

-They’ve worked with hundreds or thousands of companies to solve the same problem 
-They’ve developed processes, automation, and other forms of intellectual property that accelerate projects and initiatives 
-They’ve seen some companies succeed and clearly know what ""success"" looks like and what it takes
-They've seen many companies fail and know how to help you avoid common mistakes and missteps. 

Not leveraging external experts to complement the skills of your in-house team, accelerate key strategic initiatives, avoid common missteps, and help you identify internal blindspots is simply not smart and is based on a false sense of ego and pride.

I know because I thought that way for a long time and now realize how naive and misguided my thinking was. 

Not using external experts just because you had one bad experience with one is like saying you’re never going to a restaurant again because you had one bad meal. 

Restaurants don’t all suck - you just picked a bad one. 

Pick a better restaurant next time. Or be naive and prideful trying to cook all the meals by yourself - eat a bunch of poorly cooked meals, have it take 10x longer, and waste a bunch of time and money trying to be a self-taught Michelin Star Chef.

B2B companies come up with a million excuses and objections about why not to do it:

“We need our rep to talk to the customer to ‘provide value’ first before we tell them the price.”

“If we publish pricing on our website, our competitors will find out and undercut us.” (lol as if your competitors can’t figure out your pricing on their own)

“Our pricing is way too complicated. If we publish it, our customers will get confused and won’t talk to our Sales team.”

And a million different iterations of these objections and excuses that are all about the company and nothing about the customer. Every excuse has everything to do with what you want and zero to do with what the customer wants.

__

The most black & white way to address this at your company - which is exactly what I did in 2017 - was I ran a survey to all the decision makers at our Tier 1 & Tier 2 accounts.

One of the questions was: When buying XYZ technology, what steps in your buying process would you like to accomplish *before* you talk to a Sales representative?

More than 600 total accounts responded.

93% of the respondents said they want to know the price before they talk with a Sales rep.

There it is. Simple. 600 decision makers at target accounts telling you exactly how they want to buy. Are you going to listen to your customers or are you going to be selfish and only think about what you want?

It’s black and white. If you ask your target customers the exact same question, you would get the exact same answer.

If you’re customer-centric, it’s obvious you would publish pricing on your website.

#marketing #b2b #sales #gtm

p.s. Bulk procurement companies like Vendr continue to gain market traction because B2B companies are so selfish in their direct Sales motion.

Buyers would rather just go to a company like this than go through the dog & pony show of BANT qualification with a 22-year old, then see a canned demo 2 weeks later, then need to haggle with a rep for 15% off list price. By the time they’re done, it’s been 10 weeks to buy a $40k/year SaaS tool.

Instead, they’ll go to Vendr and get the best price w/o any of the nonsense. And the B2B company will take a 30-45% cut on margin between discounting & referral fees, all because they refuse to be customer-centric in their Sales process.

The traditional “best practices” for B2B go-to-market motions are completely misaligned with what a modern B2B buyer wants today.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chriswalker171_marketing-b2b-sales-activity-7183462398731644928-JJvz?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACvfqDkBwAMJeVXyKg234H8-yBYMOKl23bo,2024-04-09T13:54:58.135Z

This is my favorite book, the Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts.

I want to be tactical, though, you can create your own luck. You can navigate out of your situation.

But to do so requires some advice from the Shawshank Redemption:

Pressure Over Time

Optionality is built in years and months, not days and weeks.

The best optionality is built by becoming an expert, and it’s usually by combining two things (in my case, customer empathy and data w/ AI). I’m the best in the world ONLY when you mix those three things. This is a Ben Horowitz concept, and it’s beautiful.

But the way in which you can get everything that you wanted is to find out what you enjoy doing, and just begin.

Begin by working on it, talking to people about it, building little prototypes, working for people or companies for free to learn it. 

When you do that, you subtly convince the other people that love what you love that you’re in it for passion. 

This is the single thing that people want to hire for, a hunger for the work itself. For its own sake.

Weather it’s gardening, or dental hygiene, or making hats, or ice skating… I promise you there are others out there that feel the way you feel.

Then, once you know them, and once they know your only agenda is to find joy in what you do… they FIND ways to help you. Because they see the joy, they likely feel the joy, and they want other people to feel the joy.

The people I completely avoid building relationships with are those that are money driven, not because it’s bad (I love money), but just because it’s the outcome they seek not the process they love.

That only gets you so far, because you lose your purpose when you make enough money. All that money ever got me, besides freedom from 9-5, is a ridiculously over priced coffee grinder. 

Start working on the side, finding your community, doing the things you feel drawn to… and when you do, you’ll draw in others.

And one day you’ll wake up, and you’ll have so much optionality you won’t know how to chose.

That’s when you really become free, when you get to define your days around your joy, not your job.

Invest daily now, and I promise it will compound over enough time.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_if-you-dont-enjoy-your-job-and-youre-reading-activity-7393403090701475840-EGfa?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADs6jaABL787bQYRhLjcBo2NCXWQ0-9LROE,2025-11-09T21:44:19.610Z

A 🔥 example is by the crew at Lovable and it’s brilliant. They built a Product Hunt clone called Launched where builders submit their apps & the community upvotes what they ❤️

The top 5 projects each week get 100 free Lovable credits, encouraging creators to keep building. 1,577 projects have been submitted this year alone! (Btw, most of the apps have an ""Edit with Lovable"" button, making this like a template gallery on steroids.)

Here are 10 other GTM vibecoding ideas:

1. An interactive ROI calculator (looks way more legit than that old Excel file you're too embarrassed to send your prospects!)

2. A lead magnet, aka a complex mini-product for TOFU acquisition

3. A landing page that looks like it was custom-built by an agency

4. A feature prototype for customer feedback -- you can finally prove to product that folks would pay for it

5. A lead form that looks like Typeform but with custom logic (& that's free)

6. Custom Webflow pages without needing to write code

7. A conference scraping app to set up meetings

8. An app for meeting prep research before sales calls

9. A partner marketplace to feature on your website

10. A community upvoting app to tap into community-led growth

I invited Alexander Shartsis to unpack how to use vibecoding tools for GTM (no coding skills required!) in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter. Read the full guide: https://lnkd.in/eHvrxEG6

I hated them.

Their color.

Their fur. The claws. The way they pooped indoors in a bin (still weird).

And they gave me terrible allergies.

When my wife and I started dating she had a cat, and I told her it was either ME or the CAT (she chose me).

But then something weird happened. After the family dog died, my kids asked if we could get kittens. Obviously I'm a sucker and was willing to ignore my own feelings to appease my children, so we got not one but two cats. A bonded pair.

Within days the cats (of course) decided that I was their chosen human. They knew I had spoken ill of their kind. 

And they won me over!

They melted my cold grey heart and at the same time:

My allergies magically disappeared. 

So now I tell everyone that I can: it's OK to change your mind on a deeply held belief. I was once a cat hater. I mean I was deep on Twitter and in sub-Reddits talking shit about cats at every opportunity I had.

And now here I am, confessing my love for cats to the 180,000 people that follow me on LinkedIn.

-> Branded campaigns should ALWAYS have an Ad CAC payback period less than 2 months and a total CAC payback period less than 6 months. 

The worst campaign? Non-branded search campaign. $3.6MM per year. 193 Month Total CAC payback. 

-> Non-branded campaigns should ALWAYS have an Ad CAC payback period less than 12 months and a total CAC payback period less than 36 months. 

___

We were surprised by the results and wanted to check our work. So we used 4 different attribution models to analyze the spend. The above results are from the **most generous** attribution model. 

It’s wild for sure, but these types of results aren’t atypical in the analyses we do with companies spending more than $5MM per year on Google Ads. 

Here are some tips to scrutinize the spend properly:

1. Measure your results against REVENUE, not just opportunity count or “pipeline” 

2. Scrutinize each individual campaign, especially breaking out results between Branded vs. Non-Branded campaigns 

3. Calculate CAC in 3 dimensions (Ad CAC, Marketing CAC, and Total CAC) 

4. You need to have the discipline to shut off campaigns that do not achieve the appropriate ROI and reallocate the spend to other programs/channels that do.

Google paid search is often by far the largest expense across the entire Marketing budget and simultaneously the lowest performing investment.

They just get tagged that way because they come from Marketing. 

It’s actually just because you have some data and have been able to architect that data to triggers Sales to reach out to someone that didn’t ask to talk to you. 

An MQL score is not an “inbound” lead. 

Neither is an e-book download. 

Neither is a webinar attendee. 

Neither is a PQL. 

And these types of “leads” make up 90% or more of the total “inbound” volume. 

___

This distinction of “Inbound” and “Outbound” leads is super outdated for this exact reason. 

Instead, segment how Sales/SDRs follow up by:

(1) Declared Intent - A qualified buyer declares intent to buy by asking to speak with your Sales team about buying (Demo Request, Contact Form, Talk to Sales, Get Pricing, etc.). 

This segment of buyers should entirely bypass the SDR role and go directly to an experienced rep that can truly help the customer and close the deal. 

Figure out what you need to do operationally to create an efficient buying experience for your customer and make it happen for your customer. 

Plus, stop sending your best prospects (declared intent) to your least experienced people (SDRs). 

(2) Not Declared Intent - A qualified buyer doesn’t specifically ask to talk to your Sales team about buying, but we have *signals* that drives Sales to reach out to try to get a meeting. 

This is a massive segment of buyers who have shown some *signals* of intent that should be queued and prioritized for outreach. 

Look at ALL the available signals across the entire GTM and optimize the timing, targeting, channel, message, and offers to this large pool of potentially in-market buyers. 

Build a Pipeline Architecture to track every single signal that drives Sales/SDRs to outreach and the disposition of that outreach all the way through the Sales process to Closed Won/Lost. 

___

Most “inbound” leads are not actually inbound. They just get tagged that way because they come from Marketing. 

It’s time to break down the outdated department-level silo’s that prevent us from seeing the bigger picture and optimizing a holistic GTM strategy. 

The future is an account-based, signal-driven, integrated GTM Team. And that requires an entirely different set of KPIs, terminology, and analytics to plan, report, analyze, diagnose, and optimize the investments and strategy across all the GTM departments.

Candidly, Dan can be a complete pain in my ass - but that is exactly what I need. 

Dan pushes me. He sweats every dollar we spend. He questions every late night idea we have. He has even mastered the art of putting out every fire that I start.

This is the the reason Exit Five has become a real business, a real company, and something that has already outgrown my name. It's also a profitable growth machine that is making a real impact on thousands of people around the world (I have the receipts in my Apple Notes; the impact goes well beyond B2B marketing).

Dan will tackle any problem, big or small. He's on calls with my accountant, talking to our lawyer, he's interviewing candidates, he's fixing landing pages, he's coding, he's asking me why I spent $25 on a Jimmy John's sandwich at the airport. 

But more importantly he knows what we *can* be and pushes me to raise the bar. Have a high f-ing bar is one of our core values now.

Before this I used to brag about how little I was working, and now I know why: I did not have a clear purpose. I was alone. 

That has all changed in the last two years and I can confidently say that I'm in the prime of my career and we have a great business with product market fit because this guy took my call two years ago. 

His comp was heavily weighted on performance in that first year too. He took a bet on himself, smashed the goals (turns out we're both competitive) and it's be game on ever since.

He's also a good person (imagine that!) A great Dad. Husband. And the guy I would call in a pinch, for anything.

He's also grown - big time. Maturing. Evolving from a VP Marketing to a true COO. And I know there's more to come. 

Thanks for 2 great years Dan. I hope we don't have a public falling out one day where we're talking shit about each other on Twitter!!! <3

Please go follow him on LinkedIn if you are not already.

PS. We celebrated by playing TPC Scottsdale two weeks ago after the E5 team offsite and had a blast. I think it was $500 per person for 18 holes, but we put it on the Ramp card because it's a write off!

Also: I know someone will ask ""where can I find my Dan?"" Well - I didnt find him on Indeed (""no offense"" as my 8 year old says). I found him because we worked together for 8 years at two companies. That was the secret.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davegerhardt_happy-official-two-year-exit-five-anniversary-activity-7397227299680559105-BwvA?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAENSHnEBWADUDtUE5S_gaRkgrhghVxXmYhI,2025-11-20T11:00:22.081Z

Because the mass manufacturing strategy of MORE Leads, MORE SDR Headcount, and MORE Spam Cannons have created an inefficiency spiral:

Need More ""leads"" -> Lower conversion -> Inflated Costs -> Repeat. 

The cycle has spiraled out of control to a level where it now costs a B2B company 2-5X more money to acquire $1 in incremental ARR. 

The ""Predictable Revenue"" model has become entirely unsustainable.  

__

I'm old enough to remember what “Business Development” used to look like before the Predictable Revenue model came on the scene in the early 2010’s. 

Business Development teams were small teams of experienced professionals who:

-Have strong business acumen and executive presence

-Have strong domain expertise and industry experience

-Have strong connections in the industry and are respected in the industry 

-Focused on developing relationships & opportunities in large, strategic accounts (partners, Tier 1 accounts, OEMs, new markets/verticals)

-Leverage an integrated combination of physical events, in person meetings, and inside sales activities to create and close big opportunities 

-Compensated and incentivized based on creating and closing REVENUE

But here we are in 2024, and the Predictable Revenue model that has become an ""industry standard"" in tech & SaaS is cracking like cheap glass:

-Inexperienced people who don’t have strong business acumen or executive presence

-No domain expertise or industry knowledge

-No connections in the industry or awareness in the industry

-Focused often on chasing around small accounts & small deals where the SDR role just dramatically increases CAC to untenable levels 

-Only leverage inside sales using spam cannon technology to flood buyers with unpersonalized, irrelevant digital messaging asking for meetings 

-Compensated and incentivized to book meetings and hit a volume of “activities” 

____

It's pretty simple to see why the current ""industry standard"" is falling short for B2B companies, and more importantly, for their customers. 

In the future, we’re going to see a big change to how “Business Development” works in B2B companies. 

We’re going to go back to basics. Back to the fundamentals. 

Where experienced, respected, highly competent people leverage an integrated approach to develop and close new opportunities with high-value accounts. 

And a lot of the low value work done by inexperienced people to low value accounts will be automated and removed by AI. 

Time to go back to basics. 

#marketing #b2b #finance #gtm #sdr

This will be part of my next course... this course will be MUCH more tool based... here's what this tool will do...

One of the things I found myself doing a LOT in clay is copying and pasting, and I was sick and tired of being a copy and paste monkey.

What I wanted was this exact process (which DOESN'T need to involve me)...

1. Interview customer as to what they want (this is me)
2. Have customer act as the AI agent and do the work manually for 50 rows
3. Capture their process + NAMED categories (e.g. how they classify things)
4. Turn it into an AI agent 
5. Have that agent judged by their context.
6. Have AI evaluate #5 and rewrite #4.

The course will be $499 I have decided and it will replace Agent 7 (which is STILL useful and STILL good, there's just a way to do it automatically).

I loved the price of Agent 7 at $299 and my other course on PVP and PQS is a seminal work at $999. But both sold about $100k each, so I want to both price maximize WHILE having more people experience my work.

You will also be required to have a $100/mo Claude Code subscription (it's just that good). So I'll be clear about that, too. You -MIGHT- need the $200/mo thing, but I don't think so.

If you want to be notified when it launches, comment below with what you want to learn!

I used to be terrified of public speaking. But I pushed through the nerves (with an assist from Big Pharma) & am absolutely glad I did.

If you're even a little bit like me, you'll want to bookmark this post from Vincent Pierri. He's personally delivered 300+ unique talks over the last 5 years. Now he's sharing his proven framework for a better 30 min keynote.

Read the full story in Growth Unhinged here: https://lnkd.in/eydNVYxG

The framework in four steps:

1️⃣ Nail the intro (5 minutes)

Every great talk begins with tension.

Think of your intro as the “hook.” It’s where you earn the right to keep people’s attention. 

If you lose the first five minutes, you’ll spend the next twenty-five trying to win them back.

2️⃣ Build trust (3 minutes)

Trust-building is where you prove you’ve walked the path. And your title isn't enough to get the audience on your side.

Three ways to do it:
 - Experience. A quick story of failure, experiment, or success.
 - Research. Credible data, case studies, or benchmarks.
 - Relatability. A short personal story that shows you’ve been in their shoes.

3️⃣ Deliver three main points (3 × 6 minutes)

Three points is the sweet spot. Enough to feel substantial. Not so much that people forget them by lunch.

Each point follows the same mini-framework:
 - One-Liner (1 min)
 - Analogy (2 min)
 - Examples (3 min)

4️⃣ Close strong (4 minutes)

Too many talks fizzle at the end. 

Instead, close with a one-two punch:
 - Final Story (2 min)
 - Call to Action (2 min)

---

I can't wait to try out this framework for my next talk. Hope you find it as useful as I did 🙏

1. Host a weekly live event where you provide free consulting, advice, or information to your target customers (current & prospective).

2. Convert the recording of that live event to a long-form podcast (Apple Podcast, Spotify) and long-form video podcast (YouTube, Website). 

3. Cut the long-form video for micro-content for social media platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube shorts, Tik Tok, Facebook Reels, etc.)

4. Monitor performance of organic social media posts, and used paid LinkedIn to amplify your best performing posts to your target account list (Tier 1, Tier 2, or both). 

5. Collect quantitative & qualitative insights from all of these activities (Event chat, social media comments, dark social feedback, etc.) that drives future topics & ideas for the next event. 

6. Measure success against Total Pipeline generated and Blended Marketing ROI. 

7. Repeat, Learn, Iterate. 

___

The way B2B buyers research, discover, evaluate, and purchase products has fundamentally shifted. 

Having a presence and strategy for dark social content is no longer optional. It’s required. 

If you aren’t doing it, you’re missing a lot of opportunity and becoming increasingly vulnerable to competitors that move on it. 

__

High-performing Marketing teams get 10X more revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing, compared to low performers*. 

High performers: $3 in revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing.

Low performers: $0.30 in revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. 

A core difference? Almost all high performers have a powerful dark social content strategy they've invested in for a long period of time.

What's amazing about our view from the balcony with Exit Five is that we see hundreds (maybe thousands) of questions from marketers every year, so I feel like we have a strong sense of what topics are important and top of mind.

There are a million questions about AI, but the loudest one over the last year has been about AI and SEO.

- I am noticing my personal habits changing to use ChatGPT more
- My boss is asking me to look into it and how we rank in AI Search
- Google is just answering questions directly vs. sending traffic
- Our organic traffic has gone down...
- The board has some opinions about AI and SEO and I need to get smart on the topic

So our team has put together a free AI SEO course; 100% free (just with your email) and has a bunch of vides you can flip through.

Now, a lot of this is changing in real-time, so there are no secret timeless hacks here - but if you want to get SMARTER about this topic, this is a great place to start.

In this free course cover:

1. How To Get Featured in AI Search. 

Learn the signals for getting featured in AI-Driven search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews). Make sure your organization is easy for AI to recognize, trust, and quote-- so your brand shows up in AI answers.

2. The AI-Driven Research Stack. 

Watch the exact workflow to turn raw research into a focused topic map: who you’re targeting, who you’re up against, and where the gaps are, ending with a ready-to-ship content plan.

3. SERP → Brief → Draft System. 

Turn SERP analysis into production-ready content. Build briefs that capture intent, outline angles, and prompt AI for safe first drafts, without breaking SEO best practices.

4. How to Track AI Traffic in GA4. 

Set up reports to spot AI-generated sessions and measure impact. Attribute which pages, topics, and formats AI engines surface most, and what’s driving sign-ups and revenue.

5. Plug-and-Play Templates + 30-Day Plan. 

Copy the exact worksheets, briefs, and reporting frameworks the experts use. Follow a 30-day quick-wins plan to improve AI search visibility while building a sustainable long-term strategy.

Wow, things escalated","I asked 195 B2B go-to-market leaders about where they're placing their bets for 2026. The top channel bet: AI discovery aka AEO. Wow, things escalated quickly...

One company that got a head start on AEO is Webflow, the website building scaleup. Their stats via VP of growth Josh Grant:

1. 10% of signups now come from AI discovery, growing 4x year-on-year. (This is actual LLM-referred traffic, which likely understates things.)
2. 91% of LLM referrals come from ChatGPT alone.
3. ChatGPT traffic converts at 24% (!), 6x higher than Google.
4. For conversions referred by an LLM, two-in-three convert within 7 days.

3 tactics from Webflow you can apply in the next 24 hours (& one to avoid):

Avoid: Add an llms.txt file

 - The Webflow team tried it. They haven’t seen any significant lift.
 - The takeaway: focus on content optimizations instead.

Tactic 1: Automate content refreshing at scale

 - AI reshuffles answers constantly. Refresh velocity can be the difference between staying on top and missing out.
 - Webflow built an AI-driven workflow with AirOps to 5x their refresh frequency.

Tactic 2: Turn every webinar into 10 pieces of expert content

 - Webinars can make great source material. Repurposing makes them fresh, structured, and consistently discoverable by both people and AI.
 - Webflow automates this by transcribing webinars (AirOps), using LLMs to identify themes & soundbites, generating assets & adding an editorial review.

Tactic 3: Automate FAQs and schema content for AI discovery

 - FAQ sections answer long-tail questions and help LLMs get a more granular understanding of the product. ChatGPT can essentially ""borrow"" your FAQ answers in their repsonses.
 - Webflow automates this by scraping what people are asking via Reddit & Google (AirOps), generating new FAQs & answers (GPT-5, Claude), pushing updates into the CMS & then tracking any visibility shifts before/after.

1. Quantitative Business Analysis 

-Identify all the places where marketing investments are objectively wasting money (hint: it’s a lot). Give the money back to the company to hit the bottom line or re-allocate to marketing programs that are already clearly working and have scale potential. 

-Close all data & attribution gaps so you have a clean objective view of performance moving forward & start collecting initial data ASAP. Includes things like self-reported attribution, UTM tracking for performance marketing, and full lifecycle tracking using a custom object. 

2. Qualitative Customer Analysis 

-Run qualitative customer interviews with your 10 best customers and 10 worst customers. Identify the nuances in demographics & psychographics. Develop hypotheses. Adjust segmentation strategy. 

-Test the updated segmentation model yourself by running 10+ qualitative customer interviews with *prospective* customers. 

3. Figure out how to drive more revenue within the first 90 days with pipeline acceleration and demand capture (hint: it’s definitely not high volume lead gen) 

-Optimize the messaging & conversion path on the homepage of your website

-Optimize the handoff process so more customers that request a demo actually sit on a demo (crazy that only ~30% of SaaS prospective customers that ask for a demo actually sit on one - so much waste!)

-Build customer stories and/or a reference list to enable Sales to close late stage deals faster and at a higher rate. 

-Run pipeline acceleration events with Sales for key late stage deals 

____

Lots of early stage companies think they need their marketing leader to go out and get tons of MQLs in the first 30 days. This is effectively always a failure and will set you back 3-6 months while losing a lot of credibility in the company. 

These activities like customer research, segmentation, funnel optimization, and sales enablement set the foundation to then go out and CREATE DEMAND in the second/third quarter as a CMO by launching a podcast, organic social content, evangelism, paid social, influencer marketing, etc. 

Set the right order of operations first. Then set the right expectations on what metrics you’re moving and on what timeline. 

1. Customer Insights, Segmentation, and Targeting 
2. Convert More Pipeline
3. Capture More Existing Demand
4. Create More Demand

Intercom is THE case study for anyone pivoting from SaaS to AI agents. They went all-in on AI & a disruptive, outcome-based pricing model in early 2023. Now they're adding a 90-day money back guarantee.

My top 5 takeaways from a recent interview with co-founder Des Traynor. Read the full story here: https://lnkd.in/ezrHeUeJ

1. It took a ‘war time’ CEO to be the first to go all-in on AI. 

The Monday after OpenAI released ChatGPT, Eoghan made the call that Intercom would be all-in on AI to automate work.

2. Each 1% improvement in Intercom’s resolution rate was hard fought with constant A/B testing. 

With Fin there are 15 different sub-processes involved in answering a customer support question. Most of the good AI tools are *not* simply thin ChatGPT wrappers.

3 Competition will no longer be about who has the most features. 

It’ll be about how well those features work. The winners will be the ones who write the RFP for customers, teaching them how to evaluate and buy AI products.

4. If AI agents are doing the work for you, the pricing model needs to match.  Intercom has outcome-based pricing, only charging for successful resolutions.

1. Create a list of every target account in my ICP.

I'd ask sales & CS about which factors make a great account. Then I'd bring in real-life data, analyzing all won/lost deals over the past 18 months to see which factors led to the highest expected ARR per 100 opps (equation: win rate x average ACV x NRR x 100).

These factors would almost certainly include industry, company size, and geo. But I'd look to go a level deeper factoring in tech signals, hiring signals and other indicators of buying intent.

2. Identify all the most relevant contacts at those target accounts.

I'd start with initiator and champion personas. Users, influencers, and exec buyers could come later. This data used to be hard to access, unreliable & expensive -- that has quickly changed.

3. Figure out where those target accounts are in their buying journey.

If there were 1,000 accounts in my ICP, how many were we able to identify & market to? How many are aware of us (i.e. visiting the website, engaging with ads, opening emails, etc.)? How many are interested (i.e. viewing an interactive demo, visiting high-intent pages, starting a free trial)? And how many are considering a purchase (i.e. they're sales pipeline)?

From there, the bottlenecks become obvious to the entire team. It's time to tackle them. 

4. Build a pod around the biggest bottleneck.

I'd spin up 10+ tests in the first week. The variables I'd play with: the account signal, the message, the channel, the offer, and the level of 1:1 personalization. (A manual approach would be fine to start with -- I can automate what works later.)

The lowest hanging fruit is usually to convert aware/interested accounts into pipeline. This might mean warm outbound to convert website visitors, testing personalized video over LinkedIn, offering exec access, etc.

5. Create a 🔥 content asset that I know will resonate with my target accounts.

My starting hypothesis: a State of X report featuring interviews & quotes from my ICP. I'd start with highly referenceable existing customers for social proof (low-hanging fruit). I'd then use the report as an excuse to message ICP prospects (the side-benefit: account-specific insights to personalize campaigns).

I'd build this report in public -- creating a content <> community flywheel -- to already drum up interest from my ICP well before the report was published. 

--

Why this 30 day plan works: (a) it's focused on the best-fit accounts, (b) it brings tight alignment between marketing <> sales, (c) it creates quick wins -- earning trust to take bigger swings, (d) it's the best possible onboarding, and (e) it's aggressive -- setting the bar high.

And, if it doesn't work, perhaps I'd propose another brand refresh 🙃

Planning and measuring GTM based on which *department* sourced the lead. 

Most SaaS companies are trying to implement a “Four Funnel” MQL Waterfall Model and it 100% will not fix their GTM. 

“Marketing Sourced” vs. “SDR Sourced” vs. “Sales Sourced” vs “Partner Sourced”

It sounds great and easy in theory, so they can divide lead source credit between Marketing, Sales, SDRs, and Partners. And then put together the most BASIC, INADEQUATE revenue model that looks great in an Excel spreadsheet, but will 100% fail in real life. 

It’s even being taught at the most popular “schools” for CMOs & CROs. 

This model is considered a best practice in the industry and meanwhile is the main cause of Go-To-Market Dysfunction leading to Slowed Growth, GTM Team Misalignment and Inflated CAC. 

It’s the equivalent of a Car Factory trying to decide which department made the car:

""30% of the cars got made by the people who put the wheels on""

""40% of the cars got made by the people who ordered the supplies and raw materials""
 
""10% of the cars got made by the people who do incoming inspection on the raw materials""
 
""20% of the cars got made by the people who assemble the dashboard electronics"" 

Do you see how stupid this is yet? 

You need everyone in the Car Factory to do their part to build the car. 

And you need everyone in your Revenue Factory to do their part to get every closed won customer and every renewal/expansion. 

Trying to give credit to any department for building the car literally makes no sense. 

And it’s time to bring that common sense into B2B go-to-market. 

Stop using department-level attribution as a replacement to your Strategic & Operational KPIs. Start planning, measuring and optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory

I understand the ""Four Funnel MQL Model"" deeply, have implemented it many times, and personally recommended it from 2018-2022. But it will 100% fail in today’s environment because it does not produce SCALABLE UNIT ECONOMICS.

This highly inefficient model makes it “easy” for Finance to do annual planning and try to measure ROI yet basically impossible to scale, plan, forecast, diagnose, and optimize.

For mature companies, billions of dollars in enterprise value are on the line over the next few years……So be careful where you get your advice from -

It was 2021 and their revenue was skyrocketing. NRR was super high. 

They were fat and happy and didn’t want the meal I was offering. 

“What does little agency boy know anyway?” They thought. 

One of those vendors even sent me a threat of litigation for trying to help them. 

So what was the problem? 

None of their customers were using the product or getting value from it. 

It wasn't operationalized properly in Salesforce. 

Their customers’ executive teams weren’t aligned on an ABM strategy

BDRs barely used the intent company-level data, if at all. 

Their customers were paying $100k+/year for software and all they were doing was running like $5k/month of display advertising through it.  

I saw this pattern 50+ times in 2021.

Now, it sounds like their churn is through the roof. That’s the pattern I’ve seen consulting with 100+ companies in the past 18 months, at least. There’s other data that supports this. 

So I’ll tell all of you the same strategy lessons and insights I tried to tell them 4 years ago: 

1. You *NEED* to offer Strategic Professional Services if you sell a software solution that requires executive transformational change.

A Customer Success Manager (CSM) ain’t gonna cut it when the long-term success of your product relies on multiple Executives changing their mindset and operating framework and aligning on new metrics & objectives. 

You must bring high-value, expert consulting that helps your customers’ leadership team make the transformations required to have success with your product. 

2. You *NEED* to properly Operationalize your solution within the tech stack. 

Outsourcing the true technical implementation of your product to an agency, or worse, leaving it up to your customers' internal Ops team to figure out, is a clear losing strategy. 

Most legacy SaaS companies won’t do it because their investors expect 80+% gross margin and this would compromise it. But you’ll pay for it later in GRR % which is a ton more costly and painful. 

3. You can’t just sell a product and collect your MRR anymore. You *NEED* to do whatever it takes to get your customer the RESULTS you promise them. 

Tech buyers now constantly need to measure and communicate the ROI of their investments (in technology and everything else) - this is incredibly different than it was in 2021. Back then, CMOs could buy an ABM technology and barely use it just so they could be part of the Cool Kids Club. 

Now, if you aren’t getting your customers REAL RESULTS and helping them communicate the ROI and impact of your solution, you will be incredibly vulnerable.

","We are not in the “Marketing needs to do more with less era”. This narrative is toxic and flat out wrong. 

The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS. 

---

To achieve proper unit economics, B2B companies must create approximately $10 in pipeline for every $1 they spend on Marketing and SDRs combined. 

Yet, the median performance across 50+ mid-market companies we’ve analyzed is only $3 in pipeline for every $1 in spend. 

That means Marketing needs 3X more budget to hit the desired pipeline goal. And companies need 3X more SDR headcount. 

So, instead of spending $10MM to produce $100MM in pipeline, they’d need to spend $33MM to produce the same $100MM in pipeline. 

This seemingly subtle difference cascades across the GTM machine and changes total CAC payback periods from approximately 18 months all the way to 50+ months - a crippling blocker to business growth and scalability. 

And even with the inflated spend, they likely still wouldn’t get to the goal since unit economics degrade with scale, especially when executed on accelerated timelines rather than measured and methodically. 

---

TLDR: Marketing doesn’t need more budget to hit the 2025 plan. 

What really needs to happen is for your GTM machine to create pipeline with proper unit economics that lead to profitable efficient growth and target sales quota attainment. 

Spending more money isn’t the answer. Making your existing spend work 2X-3X harder to achieve proper unit economics through smart, focused, disciplined execution is the real solution.

So it's VERY fast for me to build a PVP or PQS list, like 30 mins -> 1 hr. 

Now this list isn't like ALWAYS production ready, but it's usually good enough for a test. So I tried just giving these things to prospects after a first call, in addition to my standard vibe coded proposal.

This was A TERRIBLE idea and probably lost me over $120k, and here's why...

People actually don't want to buy results... and hear me out.

Results are ephemeral, this is why every lead generation agency is always on the razor's edge. When I ran a lead gen agency, people said, ""sure this year I made $2M in closed/won deals and paid you $120k, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME THIS MONTH.""

This isn't true with Google or Facebook, because they have a monopoly and you have no choice, so they can enforce rules (you pay for clicks).

People would take these lists, sometimes even execute on them, and then I suspect they didn't get good results and said, ""THAT GUY SUCKS!""

This reaction is totally normal.

What people really want to buy (from me) is organizational change, they want to be able to do what I do. And I want that, too. I sort of design myself to be fired (I'm working on what a longer term engagement looks like).

Most lists fail, and that's okay, the real change that people need is to be able to launch 1 campaign every week, hopefully every few days. 

Taking a single list, that's 100% vibe coded, and thinking this represents the value was a bad idea because there's invariably a problem that neither of us could have forecasted.

The value was in the process to do it in an hour, not the output of any one hour.

I now know what I am selling, organizational change and education, not pipeline.

___

We were surprised by the results and wanted to check our work. So we used 4 different attribution models to analyze the spend. The above results are from the **most generous** attribution model. 

It’s wild for sure, but these types of results aren’t atypical in the analyses we do with companies spending more than $5MM per year on Google Ads. 

Here are some tips to scrutinize the spend properly:

1. Measure your results against REVENUE, not just opportunity count or “pipeline” 

2. Scrutinize each individual campaign, especially breaking out results between Branded vs. Non-Branded campaigns 

3. Calculate CAC in 3 dimensions (Ad CAC, Marketing CAC, and Total CAC) 

4. You need to have the discipline to shut off campaigns that do not achieve the appropriate ROI and reallocate the spend to other programs/channels that do. 

___

Google paid search is often by far the largest expense across the entire Marketing budget and simultaneously the lowest performing investment. 

It boggles my mind that CFOs and CEOs are not putting more scrutiny on these massive Marketing expenditures.

-Changing marketing goals from MQLs to SQLs (didn’t work)
-Putting a Chief Revenue Officer in charge of Marketing (didn’t work)
-Having a weekly pipeline meeting (didn’t work)
-Buying an ABM platform (didn’t work)

B2B companies always try to fix GTM at tactical execution (let’s hire a new growth marketer to do SEO for us) or tech & tools (let’s buy an ABM platform and change from MQLs to MQAs).

They do this because it’s easy but doesn’t solve the real problem. It’s superficial & visible. It’s easy to report back to the board in a powerpoint slide about a new tool or tactic.

But the real root cause of these issues is much more fundamental. It’s deeply rooted & invisible.

The real root cause is the operating model & data model that companies consciously or subconsciously adopt that drives the mindset of executives, investors, and GTM teams, and influences every decision they make.

Lead -> MQL/MQA -> SAL -> SQL -> SQO -> Closed Won

And here are the core issues:

1. Operates in an assembly line of silo’d departments instead of an allbound integrated revenue team.

2. Evaluation of the ROI and Impact of investments are made in silos by each department (Marketing, Sales, SDRs) instead of within a Unified GTM model.

3. There are no commonly accepted KPIs and ""attribution"" strategies for Demand Creation, so the entire GTM team doesn't focus or invest here, leaving the entire GTM engine highly imbalanced & inefficient.

4. Most companies use a model that was created between 2012 and 2017, despite how much has changed in the world in the past 6 years.

5. Marketing is optimizing for MQLs/MQAs or a poor definition of “pipeline” that doesn’t align to close won revenue. The data is clear in every Salesforce instance that core Marketing KPIs don’t align to closed won revenue, sales velocity, and marketing ROI.

6. SDRs optimize for SQLs or meetings, not closed won revenue.

7. Revenue planning models look great in a spreadsheet & break in real life.

8. All of the technology, tools, and tactical “best practices” are built around getting leads, MQLs/MQAs, and SQLs, further entrenching companies getting stuck in the model.

9. GTM teams are stuck in the incremental. How do we improve our outbound connect rates by 1%? How do we reduce our cost per lead by $3? There are no breakthroughs in growth with incremental improvements. Optimizing a broken model is not the solution, it’s changing the model.

10. No standardized data model so every company reinvents the wheel in RevOps w/o clear, performance-based definitions. Everybody on the GTM team is looking at different metrics.

When you are making adjustments for H2 2024, use these ideas as a guide. Clearly identify the core issue(s) that are holding you back. Create a solution that actually solves the root cause, instead of treating the symptoms.

What We Did: Review Enrichment & Classification Pipeline

We built a scalable pipeline to pull and analyze Google Maps reviews for 9,732 ********* practices—every company with 150+ reviews plus all PLATINUM/GOLD tier prospects. Using Apify's Google Maps Reviews Scraper at Scale tier (128 concurrent actors), we collected 201,556 unique reviews across 9,423 locations in under 2 hours. 

Each review was then processed through Claude's Message Batches API for pain signal classification, categorizing reviews into six operational buckets: scheduling issues, communication problems, billing complaints, staff issues, legacy technology mentions, and growth constraints.

 The classification results revealed that detectable pain signals are sparse: only ~1.8% of the 161,379 processed reviews contained identifiable operational complaints (2,787 communication issues, 1,981 billing mentions, 1,930 staff problems, 1,248 scheduling complaints, 1,089 growth signals, and just 453 legacy tech mentions). 

This reinforces the validation findings—Google reviews aren't a reliable source for identifying ""******* in pain."" The signal-to-noise ratio is too low, and negative reviews often reflect one-off experiences rather than systemic operational dysfunction that would drive software purchasing decisions.

 Based on this analysis, we've assigned each of the 9,732 companies a recommended product (PRODUCT 1, PRODUCT 2, or PRODUCT 3) and a message hook tailored to their dominant signal—though 69% defaulted to the general value proposition since they lacked detectable pain. The actionable output: focus outreach on ***-change signals and ******* maturity rather than trying to infer pain from reviews. The data supports ""you're evolving, here's infrastructure that scales"" messaging over ""we see you're struggling.""

Resulting in a $1.7MM annualized savings to be reallocated to higher performing programs. Here’s why:

BACKGROUND

1. Company had been spending $2MM per year on Google Ads (12% branded, 88% non-brand / competitor. 

2. CAC payback period on non-branded and competitive terms were > 5 years in both a W-shaped (generous) model and a conversion-only (strict) model. 

3. Total company pipeline production has dropped by 50% over the past 3 quarters. And Sales win rates have dropped from 16% to 10%. 

4. Current strategy to create pipeline is insufficient to hit the FY24 revenue plan and already has the FY25 growth plan at risk. 

5. Changing nothing will result in < 15% YoY growth in both FY24 and FY25. 

RATIONALE

At Passetto, we are *consistently* recommending major (> 75%) cuts to Google Ads / Paid Search investments for the following core reasons:

1. The unit economics simply don’t make sense in most cases for a complex B2B sales motion. 

Sure, you can get this channel to seemingly work when you measure it on ""cost per conversion"" or ""cost per MQL"" but the conversion rates from that point forward are awful and full funnel conversion is required to estimate true ROI. 

Cost per click = $18
Landing page conversion rate = 1% 
Conversion to Qualified Opp: 30%
Conversion to Closed Won: 12% 

Click to Closed Won = 0.04% (1 closed won for every 2,500 clicks)
Direct Advertising CAC: $50,000
Program CAC: $72,000 (estimate)
Marketing CAC: > $100,000 
Total CAC (Marketing, Sales, SDR, Ops, etc.): > $200,000 

Blended CAC payback at $40k ACV = More than 5 years. 

2. Poor unit economics on Google Ads + significant investment allocation (>25% of total budget) put massive pressure on aggregated unit economics - Marketing ROI and Total CAC. 

3. No account-level targeting on Google Ads. You can’t guarantee that the people clicking your ads for $18 per click are even qualified to buy from you (lots of Google Ads traffic and conversions are Spam or unqualified SMB). 

We instead recommended reallocating this budget to LinkedIn Ads, Meta Ads, YouTube, and Connected TV where the targeting capabilities are significantly more accurate and sophisticated so we know the advertising investments are going towards people and accounts that can actually buy from us. 

_____

People follow me on LinkedIn because I see insights, patterns, and trends in real-life years before they become mainstream. Well this one could make a massive difference for you over the next 18 months:

Divest from a majority of Google Ad spend and reallocate to drive more pipeline production and better overall ROI against your go-to-market spend. 

The data is blindly obvious. If CMOs aren't pushing it, it's time for CEOs and CFOs to apply pressure here.

Nearly every software company I talk to is rethinking their pricing & packaging. Yet rarely is it clear who actually owns the decision -- or the work! -- apart from, perhaps, the Founder/CEO.

The latest data via my new State of B2B Monetization report:

 - <$1M ARR: The founder/CEO owns pricing (71% of the time)
 - $1-5M ARR: The founder/CEO owns pricing (69%) with an assist from sales
 - $5-20M ARR: Pricing is a hot potato between the founder/CEO (38%), product (18%) and sales (12%) -- or nobody (21%)
 - $20-150M ARR: Pricing shifts to product (43%) but becomes a team sport with input from sales, marketing & finance
 - >$150M ARR: Finance & ops play a *much* bigger role as folks focus on pricing as a lever for profitability

My two cents on the data:

1. Expect that you'll need to keep evolving your pricing. AI is simply changing too fast to blindly stick with the status quo.

2. As pricing becomes an increasingly strategic (& complex) decision, it needs to be resourced accordingly. Assign an owner to collect data on costs, competitors & customer value.

3. Involve finance & ops earlier! They can help make sure that new AI feature doesn't sink the profitability of the business.

Software as we know it is doomed… and not exactly because of vibe coding. Or those grumpy engineers that hate vibe coding.

It’s because it’s designed to trap up in their worldview, with their tools, with interfaces we must click on, with subpar voice interfaces, with all of these opinions that make us adjust OUR behavior to their opinions on what we should do.

I think the future of software willl be more bespoke workflows that are hardened and trusted that I can envoke and pay for like an API.

Will people vibe code their own CRMs, I dunno, that kinda stuff seems sticker to me as it’s critical infrastructure.

But most software is not (meeting note takers, watch out) and most software forces us to use it, to learn it, and to horde our work and make it impossible to export our data.

More so than the data is the context tho, prompts, workflows.

Most software has no place to store our intent, what we want to accomplish, who we are, what our goals are… they all force us to do it their way.

So the huge divide between software and outcomes will be both our context, integrations with our tools that can act autonomously, and compounding plus silo’d understanding of the tasks we need to do.

While engineers moan that “vibe coding will never replace Salesforce because of X, Y, and Z” (true I think), they miss the huge gigantic point that these models:

1. Are amazing at low stakes tasks (daily life)
2. Can capture an understand intent like a person
3. Can build workflows locally to do things that have low risks
4. And that all of the above makes us FASTER at doing TASKS in ONE SHOT.

There’s a revolution coming, slowly but surely, and those that will win will think about how custom code can start eliminating tasks for them.

And as it eats away at task, and if you’re on the frontier, you can charge a lot of money for very little work… simply by understanding the compound nature of value and working in the future, but taking money from today’s economy.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_i-think-ive-seen-the-future-of-software-activity-7405717947882647552-zPid?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFgjPbUBezTI8Hq3YZEHPDYXMhtl4HhVFkU,2025-12-13T21:19:10.361Z

This heavily debated topic is now crystal clear.

1. If Marketing reports to the CEO, then the CEO owns GTM by default. 

2. If a CRO owns Marketing, Sales, and Expansion/Renewal, then the CRO owns GTM. 

Those are the only 2 real options from my perspective. 

So what’s the insight? 

Most CEOs and CROs don’t know how to properly judge, analyze, optimize and scale Pipeline Creation (Marketing + SDRs), especially when there is so much pressure on unit economics. 

This blindspot can slow growth, increase CAC, and decimate shareholder value during the Growth and Scale Up phase. 

__

If you want to build your GTM and steer your ship to an eventual IPO or Exit, the first thing you need to do is figure out exactly where you are right now. 

CEOs & CROs know they’re in North America. 

But they need to know that they’re in Austin, TX on the corner of 6th and Colorado looking south-west.  

They need to precisely know the performance of their Revenue Factory so they can properly align GTM teams, strategic initiatives, and investment allocation to drive the company forward and maximize shareholder value. 

Right now CEOs & CROs sit through a 5 hour board meeting and 120-slide Marketing, Sales, and SDR decks and still don’t really know what's going on. 

It’s filled with a bunch of data and reports and zero executive-level strategic insights. 

Their only reference point is their own internal goals & planning or what their board/investors say. 

They are missing a *critical* external perspective that helps them see the bigger picture, calibrate and contextualize their performance, and align their GTM teams and investments. 

The only person who can fix your Revenue Factory is the person who has full ownership of GTM. Most of the time, that is the CEO. 

Once you recognize this reality, it’s extremely powerful.

Never have I seen benchmarks go out of date so quickly.

Back in 2022 the typical <$1M ARR startup had 13 people. ""T2D3"" was the name of the game. Hiring a big team was a flex & the highest quartile of <$1M ARR SaaS companies had 38 (!) people. 

As of last year that figure had dropped to 7 people on average. Expectations around ARR per employee are through the roof. AI agent workflows have become the 'thirst trap' of LinkedIn. The new flex is reaching the top of the Lean AI startup leaderboard. 

Let's separate hype from reality & find out what's *really* going on. Take the 9th annual SaaS benchmarks survey here: https://lnkd.in/ga9H2NZ2

At $50MM","CEOs and CROs know they have a “Pipeline Problem” but they don’t realize it’s costing them more than $50MM every quarter they don’t fix it. 

At $50MM ARR and $15MM per year on Marketing & BDRs (simplification of the core investments to Create Pipeline):

1. [Root Cause] Pipeline Creation ROI drops by 50% from 1Q23 to 3Q24. 

2. [Growth Rate Slows] New Logo revenue growth slows by approximately $5MM/year and slows growth by 9% 

3. [GTM Efficiency Up to > 250%] Cut costs to lower CAC, but CAC is still up by close to 2X 

These combined factors of Growth Rate, GTM Efficiency, and Profitability create a minimum EV difference of 5X revenue multiple = $250MM per year in Enterprise Value. 

Every quarter it doesn’t get fixed, it costs Shareholders and Investors at least $50MM. And delays the time horizon for the compounding power of a SaaS business. 

—

And why is it happening? Because B2B companies don’t have a proper Pipeline Creation Methodology. On a $15MM per year budget to Create Pipeline, they have:

-Team of 30 Marketers
-Team of 20 SDRs
-$6MM per year in Marketing programs 

And no clear methodology to Create Pipeline at an appropriate Unit Economics.

__ 

The Marketing department deploys approximately 80% of the Company’s investments to Creating Pipeline.

And most Marketing Departments aren’t accountable to a proper Unit Economics target. 

And it’s one of the most painful, expensive problems in the entire B2B industry today. 

#finance #b2b #marketing #gtm #sales

B2B Companies don't have a Pipeline Creation Methodology, so they default to the Lead Gen Waterfall from 2012. 

Or they try to implement the Demand Unit Waterfall a la ABM from 2018, with no practical sense of implementation and it breaks down IRL every time. 

So they fall back on the Lead Gen Waterfall from 2012, except now they break it down by which department sourced the lead....

Installing a “Four Funnel” model that divides lead source credit between Sales, Marketing, SDRs, and Partners was an appropriate strategy that I personally recommended in 2018-2022. 

But this model will 100% fail in today’s environment and in the future, because it does not produce SCALABLE UNIT ECONOMICS. This highly inefficient model makes it “easy” for Finance to measure ROI yet basically impossible to scale, plan, forecast, diagnose, and optimize.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chriswalker171_finance-b2b-marketing-activity-7256652276193255424-I8BX?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD8GrLcBE7ciJJbphgPJwGu7ksT3ZWLXliQ,2024-10-28T13:05:24.724Z

The Marketing KPIs are not aligned to Business Results. 

__

People on LinkedIn put creativity on a pedestal, but B2B Marketing is the antithesis of Creative. 

B2B Marketing has spent the last 10-15 years running the same outdated, ineffective playbook of:

-Build PDF e-books that hide behind forms
-Run 7-step generic email nurtures
-Scale SDR farms to manage the spam cannons
-Spend millions per year on Google Ads w/o justifiable ROI
-Build 10+ over-priced ineffective trade show booths per year

And here’s why it happens:

Because the way B2B Marketing has been measured has not changed in the past 10-15 years either.

It’s built around “Leads” and “Web Traffic” and “Influenced Revenue Reporting” instead of actual business results. And there are no proper targets for achieving scalable unit economics. 

This misalignment between Marketing Metrics and Business Results boxes in Marketing to a very narrow set of traditional tactics, and is the OPPOSITE of Creativity. 

Want to help your Marketing team be dramatically more Creative? Here’s how:

1. Track Your Current Marketing Metrics and (New) Business Level Metrics Simultaneously. 

2. Prove to Yourself and other Execs that the Business Level Metrics are much better indicators of Marketing success 

3. Shift Marketing accountability from BS to BUSINESS RESULTS. (1) ROI of Create Pipeline Investments, (2) New Logo Efficiency %, (3) Growth Rate 

4. Empower your Marketing team to execute activities that drive the highest ROI (Pipeline & Revenue per $ spent, regardless of attribution). 

5. Leverage attribution and other forms of custom analytics as *secondary* forms of measurement and data to optimize the strategy & investments. 

__

It should be *impossible* for Marketing to hit their targets 2-3 quarters in a row while Sales misses quota and the Company misses growth targets. 

Yet, it literally happens all the time. 

And B2B companies try to fix it with band-aid solutions like:

-Have a CRO-CMO weekly coffee meeting. 
-Change National Sales Meeting to ""Revenue Kickoff""
-Have a Pipeline meeting on Wednesdays. 
-Spend 6 months to build a new attribution system in the CRM
-Try a bunch of random stuff that doesn’t solve the problem. 

But the only real solution is to fix the Marketing KPIs, so they are perfectly aligned to business results. 

If Pipeline Creation is the biggest opportunity in your business (and for many, it definitely is), make sure you fix the real problem!

p.s. Your Marketing strategy and investments are caused by your attribution model and KPIs, not the other way around 🙂

108,Chris Walker,0,604,129,19,752,504.2,1.2,“We don’t use agencies or consultants because I had a bad experience with one several years ago”. That’s what a Director of RevOps told me yesterday. ,"“We don’t use agencies or consultants because I had a bad experience with one several years ago”. That’s what a Director of RevOps told me yesterday. 

It’s like saying you’re never going to a restaurant again because one time you had a bad meal. 

I used to think the same way when I was young, naive and inexperienced. I took so much pride in thinking I knew everything and could do it all myself. 

But then in 2013, despite me arguing against it, the company I worked for hired a Strategic Marketing Consultant named Andy and it fundamentally changed my career. 

Andy taught me all the really important things about Marketing that most people don’t talk about - how to conduct customer interviews, how to create a business case, how to run a beta trial, how to build a differentiated strategy using product, price, distribution, and promotion all together. 

Then again in 2017, the company I worked for hired a Category Design Consultant named Robin who taught me everything about category design, positioning, narrative design and strategic communications. 

Then again in 2018, the company I worked for hired a Creative & Branding agency who totally transformed our website, sales decks, and advertising assets and taught me everything I know about the creative process and how much it matters in properly communicating your message to the market. 

A lot of my skills, experience, and success in entrepreneurship can be directly attributed to these experiences working with external experts that taught me specialized knowledge, processes, and ways of thinking. 

___

External experts (agencies, consultants, fractionals, etc.) have distinct advantages that simply can’t be replicated by in-house employees:

-They’ve worked with hundreds or thousands of companies to solve the same problem 
-They’ve developed processes, automation, and other forms of intellectual property that accelerate projects and initiatives 
-They’ve seen some companies succeed and clearly know what ""success"" looks like and what it takes
-They've seen many companies fail and know how to help you avoid common mistakes and missteps. 

Not leveraging external experts to complement the skills of your in-house team, accelerate key strategic initiatives, avoid common missteps, and help you identify internal blindspots is simply not smart and is based on a false sense of ego and pride.

I know because I thought that way for a long time and now realize how naive and misguided my thinking was. 

Not using external experts just because you had one bad experience with one is like saying you’re never going to a restaurant again because you had one bad meal. 

Restaurants don’t all suck - you just picked a bad one. 

Pick a better restaurant next time. Or be naive and prideful trying to cook all the meals by yourself - eat a bunch of poorly cooked meals, have it take 10x longer, and waste a bunch of time and money trying to be a self-taught Michelin Star Chef.

For context, I write a newsletter about startup growth and monetization called Growth Unhinged. I also work with tech companies 1:1 as an advisor and consultant.

1. If I had to describe the transition in one word it would be *overstimulated*. 

I see so much opportunity yet everything falls to me. Getting summoned to three weeks of federal jury duty in January certainly doesn’t help (& might’ve caused a mild panic attack). 

I’m resolving to make 2026 the year of focus and, hopefully, some delegating.

2. The newsletter became a Business Bestseller on Substack (#47), only two months after introducing the paid tier!

It’s now doing >$75k in annualized revenue from subscribers! (Ads are a bigger revenue source, although I’d like the two to be equal by the end of next year.)

3. I’m working on more premium offers to make paid subscriptions a no brainer without alienating free readers. 

Only 0.6% of readers are on the paid tier… not great compared to tech companies.

What’s on my mind for 2026: subscriber-only perks on top GTM tools (coming in January 👀), special in-depth reports, and ways to bring the community together. I’m very open to ideas!

4. My best decision yet has been to team up with CJ and Ben to launch the Mostly Growth podcast. 

It’s a great excuse to have water cooler conversations with “coworkers”. And we recently started bringing in guests like Brian Balfour, Emily Kramer, Leah Tharin, Dave Kellogg & Roland Ligtenberg.

Somehow we’re already 20 (!) episodes in, which I hear is better than 90% of podcasts. Hope folks like it as much as I like recording it!

I sit in meetings where B2B companies waste tens of thousands of hours each year (literally) debating which attribution model. Or not making any important strategic changes because they can’t agree on an attribution and planning model. 

Their Pipeline Problem, driven by declining ROI and performance on Marketing & SDR investments, is costing them at least $50MM per quarter. 

And instead of fixing the real problem and creating massive value, we sit and debate changing from first touch to last touch for 6 months and end up changing nothing. 

Internally at the company, they don’t see it. 

But from the outside working with 50+ companies this year, it’s obvious to me that the way B2B companies use this attribution system is the *cause* of their Pipeline Problem, not the solution. 

Every B2B company is trying to build a “Four Funnel” attribution model to divide credit between Marketing, SDRs, Partner, and Sales. And it’s literally the worst way to plan, measure, and optimize your GTM in 2024 and beyond. 

Because Marketing, SDRs, and Partners all have different superpowers and objectives in business and revenue generation. So why in the World would we measure them all the same? Make it make sense!! 😭 😭 

This model pushes every department to focus on the same, small part of the customer journey where lead origination source is tracked. Aka everyone is fighting over trackable attribution instead of operating as a Unified Revenue Factory. 

Your GTM strategy and tens of millions of dollars in investments get built to appease the attribution model, not the other way around. 

It’s an incredibly simplistic financial model. That worked great in 2021 when you had massive market tailwinds, and everyone’s coming in to buy your stuff, and NRR is through the roof, and none of your investors care about unit economics. 

The “Four Funnel” model works great to just divide the credit dy department and pour millions of dollars more in. 

But when you need to be intentional about your investments and achieve proper unit economics to scale, this model fundamentally breaks. 

Which is why I personally recommended this approach from 2018-2022 and I’m forcefully pushing against it now. 

Because I understand this model deeply, I know its flaws, and I know it will not work in today’s environment. And we’re never going back to the way it used to be. 

If you try to use this model to scale your company to $100MM+ ARR, you will inevitably run into painful, expensive unit economics problems that will slow down your growth path by multiple years.

Go-To-Market Teams can’t capitalize on these MAJOR business opportunities because these channels don’t get measured by their outdated software-based attribution models. 
 
Go-To-Market Teams can’t be in the places buyers spend time and actually help them because those activities don’t fit into their outdated software-based attribution models. 
 
Go-To-Market Teams can’t do the right thing for their customers because doing the right thing doesn’t get credited in their outdated software-based attribution models. 
 
It’s a real travesty. 
 
Because if you talked to your customers & actually listened to them about where they spend time, where they get information, and how they want to buy, you’d see these insights are SO OBVIOUS.

Many predicted the demise of outbound. Well, it's alive & kicking. GTM leaders told me that intent-based outbound is the no. 2 channel where they plan to invest more in 2026, just behind AI discovery.

Here's an extremely tactical guide to what's working (and AI workflows you can steal) via Fivos Aresti, co-founder of AI-first growth studio Workflows.io.

👉 Manual cold outreach for ICP target accounts

Signals are great, but most target accounts aren't in market (yet). Start by mapping out the TAM & then filter down to a list of target accounts.

Fivos found 66,000+ companies, then narrowed it to 5,700 ICP targets. These were split into four tiers:

 - Dream 150 accounts (highly manual)
 - Tier 1 (cold calling & more personalization)
 - Tier 2 (automation via email & LinkedIn)
 - Tier 3 (automation via email only)

🛠️ Key tools: BuiltWith (identify HubSpot users), GetLatka (identify SaaS companies), Exa (crawl websites w/ AI), Crunchbase (identify funding), Apollo (identify firmographic info), Clay (research & qualification).

👉 Automated, signal-based plays for other ICP accounts

These perform 2x-10x better than cold outreach plays. The five signal-based plays they prioritized:

 - Customer alumni play
 - Website visitor de-anonymization play
 - LinkedIn connections of founders play
 - LinkedIn engagement play
 - Social listening play

LinkedIn connections of founders is performing best. Fivos sees a 25.4% (!) reply rate, although much of this is harvesting demand from 1.5+ years of posting content.

1. Smaller Internal W2 Fixed Cost Marketing Teams 

We will see more 10-per","7 Trends for B2B Marketing in 2025 that should happen but probably won’t:

1. Smaller Internal W2 Fixed Cost Marketing Teams 

We will see more 10-person Marketing teams at $100MM ARR than we will 100-person teams that many are accustomed to. Tons of management layers, reporting workflows, and inflated overhead costs that actually slow you down.

2. Senior leaders will get back into Execution.

No more sitting in Ivory towers with 4 management layers between Strategy and Execution. Smaller teams means senior leaders are in the execution, close to customers, and learn how to use AI to exponentially increase their productivity.

3. Greater usage of Offshoring & AI (more flexible, less costly)

Low level executional roles like video editing, graphic design, (potentially) paid media execution, email prospecting, etc. will be executed by AI and operated/managed by 1 expert in the craft.

4. Greater usage of External experts that bring process, data & automation that augments internal staff & builds competitive advantages.

For almost a decade, B2B companies have taken pride in trying to do everything in-house (see Point 1 above). And they miss out on amazing process, data, automation, insights, and expertise from external experts that simply cannot be replicated in-house.

5. Greater investment and weighted budgeting to program dollars and less to W2 headcount.

The typical budget allocation is 55/45 Programs to Headcount investment in the Marketing budget. Over time, we will see that more weighted to 75/25 Programs to Headcount as companies get more efficient on Headcount strategy, implement AI and offshoring. 

This adjustment creates meaningfully more flexibility for the Revenue Factory.

6. CMOs that don’t own the Prospecting machine (e.g. BDRs) are at a severe disadvantage

It’s true. Process efficiency & alignment matter. If your BDRs & Marketing team spend most of the time debating “Inbound” vs. “Outbound”, you are almost guaranteed to miss your targets.

7. CMOs that aren’t intently focused on unit economics & ROI will be fired by Mid-2026

Boards are about to put the hammer down on Marketing. If they haven't already. CMOs that communicate a clear, simple, financially-driven story to the board around performance, opportunities and future plans will succeed. Those that continue to present “marketing sourced revenue reports” , “number of MQLs or demo requests”, “influenced revenue reports” and over-complicated, unhelpful touchpoint data won’t have their job in 12 months.

PE investments that invested 2021-2022 have 2-3 more years left on the hold and they aren’t happy with the current return profile. Growth needs to accelerate and CAC needs to go down big time to get the exit multiple they want.

__

Everything changed in 2022-2023. Most of the traditional Marketing playbook for a CMO is now set up to get you fired, not rewarded. 

It's a new era for CMOs. Are you stuck in the past or paving the way forward?

BACKGROUND

1. Gartner collected a *survey* of 395 CMOs and Mark","The Gartner 2024 CMO Spend Survey. Here’s the breakdown and what you need to know 👇 

BACKGROUND

1. Gartner collected a *survey* of 395 CMOs and Marketing leaders about their budgets in 2024 compared to 2023 (conducted in Q1 2024).

2. Survey respondents were from 11 different countries across 10 major industries, including financial services, high tech, manufacturing, healthcare, travel, etc.

3. Median annual revenue from respondents was $5.3 BILLION

4. Respondents were 43% B2B, 21% B2C, and 36% blended B2B and B2C.

KEY FINDINGS

1. In the surveyed sample, Marketing budgets fell by 15% from 2023 to 2024 from 9.1% of total company revenue down to 7.7%.

2. In the survey sample, Marketing allocations changed from 2023 to 2024 with companies spending more on Marketing Programs as a % of total marketing budget, and less on MarTech, Agencies, and Headcount.

3. The publication uses this data to support the narrative of CMOs in the “Do More with Less Era”

AND HERE’S MY TAKE

1. Median annual revenue of $5.3 Billion. 

If you are less than $1B-$2B in revenue, this data is not relevant to you.

2. The data from Gartner is collected from **survey responses**.

It’s highly unlikely the respondents are pulling out their $5B+ P&L from last year, analyzing every line item, properly categorizing each expense, and reporting it accurately on a SurveyMonkey. This data is not standardized, not validated, and not trustworthy from my perspective.

3. Budgeting and benchmarking your Marketing budget as a % of total company revenue is a lazy, inaccurate way to determine how much you should spend on Marketing.

This lazy calculation does not include critical factors such as (1) YoY Revenue Growth Rate, (2) Gross Margin, (3) EBITDA / FCF, (4) S&M % of Net New ARR, (5) NRR %, (6) Sales:Marketing spend ratio.

4. The reported budget allocations are wildly different than what we see at Passetto in our full third-party budget analyses of more than 60 middle-market B2B tech companies in the past 12 months.

Internal Headcount: Garter reports 22%. Passetto typically sees 35%-50%
Programs / Media: Gartner reports 28%. Passetto typically sees 45%-60%
Agencies: Gartner reports 22%. Passetto typically sees 4-8%
MarTech: Gartner reports 24%. Passetto typically sees 2-5%

5. The Marketing needs to “Do More With Less Era” is a toxic narrative and flat-out wrong.

Broadly, the budgets supplied to Marketing in 2024 are sufficient to achieve the tempered business growth goals. The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS.

CMOs and Marketing leaders need to completely rethink how to deploy budgets to achieve a CAC target that’s acceptable to the business.

It’s 100% possible. Companies did it for decades before the COVID-Boom and subsequent COVID-Fallout where budgets inflated & CAC payback periods increased by more than 100% from 2021-2024.

It's time to stop complaining ""we don't have enough budget"" and get back to core business fundamentals.

Charlie has perfect pitch, he’s an incredible artist. Even Taylor Swift sang about him, “We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.”

The thing about a good message is not that it’s perfect, it’s that it’s authentic.

And the average of many authentic pieces of writing is oddly inauthentic. 

There IS a recipe for authenticity in GTM and it’s petty simple…

1. Understand the organizing principle for why your different types of customers buy (industries, use cases, jobs to be done, pain, etc). You’re looking for what unites buyers besides “they all bought my software.”

2. Go figure out what insight that group of buyers had, WHY you? If it’s because they trusted who referred them, that’s hard. You’re looking for their counter intuitive truth.

3. Use AI to figure out where the data lives where you can find batches of people in this same situation.

Then all you have to do is tell the story you learned in 2 to the customers from the list in 3.

AI won’t replace our creativity and to use to it send creative messages is weirdly missing the point.

You should use it to find the needles in the haystack and to explain what the last needle did to get out. 

And HOW you do it is the art part. And often, the surface area of intelligence from 1 and 2 is SO low or 1 for horizontal SaaS is SO HARD  that you default to mostly blasting stuff. 

But it’s the sitting on the piano moment that can’t be replicated by AI and I think our buyers will know what authenticity sounds like well into the future.

As the noise has increased a ton, but the signal has always sounded the same.

The B2B Marketing profession will slowly die if this doesn’t change. It’s already happening. 

-Lots of PE firms telling me they are broadly disappointed with Marketing performance and the business acumen within that department

-Lots of CROs telling me they don’t have confidence their Marketing team can fix the pipeline problem.

-Lots of CEOs needing to make changes to Marketing leadership due to continued underperformance (inadequate unit economics that don't scale)

-Revenue Marketing / Demand Gen / ABX is starting to roll into the Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). Some CMOs are trying to give this away from their mandate and focus only on Product Marketing & Comms. 

-Product Marketing teams are starting to roll into Product or Strategy, instead of Marketing. 

Don’t shoot the messenger. 

These are facts about what’s happening, not my opinion. 

You can get mad at me for telling you the truth, or you can use this information to your advantage. 

___

Unfortunately, just changing who owns the responsibilities that Marketing currently owns isn’t going to fix this problem. It's just yet another superficial band-aid B2B companies use to patch up this problem for a few quarters until the dysfunction resurfaces again. 

___

B2B companies continue to spin around in a circle

1. Hire a New CMO
2. Get measured on the wrong things
3. Do the wrong things
4. Don’t have a story to tell around business impact because there isn’t one
5. CMO asked to resign
6. Repeat every 18 months 

Change how you measure the success of your CMO and magically Marketing strategy changes and the impact of Marketing investments increase dramatically. Smart people can achieve clear goals. 

The person in the seat (CMO) isn’t the problem. The process of how we plan, measure, and optimize our Pipeline Creation process is the real problem. 

Stop wasting your time hiring a new CMO that will be set up to fail and FIX THE REAL PROBLEM.

Here are 5 of my favorite marketing use cases for AI agents -- ,"The ability to build & manage AI agents is quickly becoming a core skill for everyone. Here are 5 of my favorite marketing use cases for AI agents -- with templates ⤵️ 

1️⃣ Lead scoring & qualification

Lead scoring is part art, part science. You want to enrich fields via 3rd party data, but also bring in form data & some human(like) judgement. 

Turns out AI agents are great at this -- and you can add a human-in-the-loop escalation via Slack when the classification isn't clear.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

2️⃣ Lifecycle emails

Traditional lifecycle emails are pretty mid (did I say that right?!). But AI agents can track new customers, analyze interesting ones & then automatically draft personalized emails suggesting next steps.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

3️⃣ Competitor tracking 

Everyone is racing to write comparative content for AI search. This content needs accurate, real-time info on competitors including features, pricing info, reviews & more (otherwise you'll get penalized).

Turns out that AI is pretty great at scraping text and sending alerts when there are significant updates.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

4️⃣ Content research

You need to stay on track with what's trending with your audience & key influencers in your space. But nobody has time to monitor dozens of LinkedIn profiles & Substacks. You can get an AI agent to do the research for you & write a report on the top-performing themes.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

5️⃣ LinkedIn coaching

AI models have spiky intelligence. While they struggle with things that seem easy, they're surprisingly brilliant at things like analysis & coaching. You can create your own PhD-level coach to improve your LinkedIn game with tips on what's going well & what to change.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

-The CRM Data Architecture - Companies take this Operating Model & build a homegrown implementation in the CRM using fragmented data & objects across different departments. So there’s no aligned data strategy across the entire company (it’s true).

-The Financial Data Architecture - The only way expenses are tagged are by GL Code. There is no integrated strategy to optimize for unit economics across the customer lifecycle (No wonder Median CAC is up 2X!) 

-C-Level KPIs - There's often no accountability to a unit economics target at the “top of the funnel”, meaning the massive investments in Marketing business development aren't aligned to business performance (No wonder CMO Tenure is 17 Months, they’re set up to fail with misaligned goals)

-Lack of Centralized Integrated Alignment Process - The Operating Model, company culture, poor data architecture & GTM Planning Model create and facilitate a Decentralized Department Silo’d style of management & operations that lack the coordination required to drive faster growth & better GTM efficiency.

-GTM Operating & Planning Model - The Operating Model built to try to divide the credit by which Department “sourced” the lead has not evolved since the early 2010’s and clearly misaligns the GTM teams. Downstream, it drives overly-simplistic, inaccurate “ROI” calculations by Finance. This planning model gives you ZERO visibility on how to optimize and scale.

CEOs - When all of these critical business workflows are not aligned into a highly effective process, you will get poor results and then (often) blame it on talent instead of yourself. 

Are you starting to see why the only people who can fix this are the board and the CEO?

130,Chris Walker,0,535,106,16,657,504.2,1.06,"I talked to 100+ SaaS executives at the Pavilion GTM 2024 conference and here was my #1 takeaway:

~75% of CROs and CEOs know Pipeline is the #1 problem in their Revenue Factory. 

And here are the unspoken undertones:

1. CROs & CEOs don’t have the data to diagnose & fix their pipeline problem. 

2. CROs & CEOs don’t have the expertise to strategize and manage Pipeline Creation the same way they do with Sales process/forecasting. 

3. CROs & CEOs don’t have confidence that their CMO can solve it. 

And when you break down the department-level silo’s and analytics, the TARGET is simple:

For our Revenue Factory to deliver proper unit economics with less than 150% New Logo GTM Efficiency....

We need to deliver $2 in REVENUE for every $1 invested to Create Pipeline (majority of expenses are Marketing, SDRs, Tech/Admin)....

Then add in Sales headcount, operations, commissions, etc. and you still land at or under an 18-month New Logo CAC payback period. 

__

So for a $20MM investment in Creating Pipeline, you need:

$200MM in Pipeline at a projected 10% win rate 

$80MM in Pipeline at a projected 25% win rate. 

But when your Pipeline Creation process in the Revenue Factory is inefficient, you don’t get the appropriate ROI on all of these combined investments. 

So instead of getting $200MM in Pipeline at a 10% win rate, you get $50MM. 

Instead of getting $80MM in Pipeline at a 25% win rate, you get $20MM. 

You miss out on $100MM+ in Pipeline each year, $10MM+ in future revenue, and hundreds of millions in Enterprise Value for founders, employees, and investors. 

And then:

-Sales is starving waiting at the bottom of the funnel with no pipeline coverage
-Your most expensive resources in the Revenue Factory (Sales) start doing low value work in other areas of the Factory (e.g. low quality prospecting)
-You miss pipeline targets by 25% up to 75% 
-PRP drops and forces Sales headcount reductions 
-CAC increases to untenable levels 

And the ONLY way to fix your Pipeline Problem is to improve the blended Unit Economics at the “top of the funnel” 

To do this, you need an INTENTIONAL plan. This metric will never improve on its own by accident. 

____

For SaaS companies > 95% NRR, fix your Pipeline Problem to achieve appropriate unit economics at the “Top of the Funnel” i.e. Pipeline Creation in the Revenue Factory…..and you become one of the most valuable private SaaS companies in terms of metrics with > 40% Growth Rate and GTM Efficiency < 200%. And command a 10-18X TTM revenue multiple instead of a 3-6X. 

(yes, that impact is usually in the $Billions ;)

___

Companies spend millions of dollars each year to implement, train, and execute against a clear Sales methodology. 

But literally do NOTHING and invest NOTHING in a clear methodology to Create Pipeline. 

^And that’s the 9-figure to 10-figure problem hiding in plain sight for most CEOs > $50MM ARR.

131,Chris Walker,0,528,81,20,629,504.2,1.05,"This data is INSANE. And proves the “Growth at All Costs” era is over.

Quite literally billions of dollars in enterprise value driven by how cost-efficient your go-to-market (GTM) is. Let’s check it out 👇 

First - yes, Growth matters. And has one of the largest impacts on TTM Revenue Multiple and Enterprise Value. 

But now Efficiency also matters - how much it costs to grow. Which is most heavily impacted by the ROI of the entire go-to-market GTM investment (40-60% of total revenue invested in GTM). 

__

So here’s the metric you need to monitor: GTM EFFICIENCY %

GTM Efficiency % = [TTM Total GTM Expenses] / [TTM Total Net New ARR]  * 100%

Put simply, GTM Efficiency % means how much did you spend on GTM to generate $1 in Net New ARR. 

(The smaller, the better) 

Net New ARR = New Logo + Expansion - Contraction - Churn 

Total GTM Expenses = Sales, Marketing, SDRs, Operations, Leadership, Admin, Training, Technology, Data, etc. 

But this number has been getting a lot bigger since 2021 in both the public markets and private markets. And it's decimating enterprise value in the process. 

__

So here’s the thing you need to know: SaaS companies with better GTM Efficiency are valued significantly higher (as a multiple of TTM Revenue). 

GTM Efficiency > 250% -> 3.6X median revenue multiple
GTM Efficiency 175% - 250% -> 6.4X median revenue multiple
GTM Efficiency < 175% -> 10X median revenue multiple

Wow, companies with *efficient* GTM are valued 2X-3X more than SaaS companies with demonstrably inefficient GTM. 

And that makes a difference of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to shareholders. 

CEOs, CFOs, and Investors take note! 
__

The “Growth at All Costs” era is over. 

Drive hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in increased enterprise value in 2025 by hitting your growth target while also maintaining target GTM Efficiency < 175%.

You could have talented Sales reps, all the best technology in the World, and capable senior leaders.....and it would still be a total disaster. 

-You wouldn’t know what data to collect 
-You wouldn’t be able to plan and forecast the future accurately
-You wouldn’t have insights to diagnose issues or optimize investments 
-You wouldn’t have a system to hold people accountable and keep people on track 
-Your strategy would live and die simply by the talent and training of people instead of through *systems* and *data*

But a Sales Methodology becomes the foundational SYSTEM the entire Sales team runs on.

It drives what data we collect. It drives consistency in our process. It gives us data & insights to optimize. It helps us hold people accountable and keep people on track. Our entire company uses the same deal stages, data properties, terminology, etc. It creates the ORDER instead of chaos. 

No matter how good your CRO is, your 100 person Sales team would totally fail without a Sales Methodology adopted across the company. 

And here’s the wildly non-obvious insight (and why you follow me): 

ZERO B2B companies have a comprehensive Pipeline Creation Methodology. It’s a Frankenstein, homegrown system evolved from the 2012 MQL Demand Waterfall. 

You can have a super talented CMO, a great team of Marketers & BDRs, adequate budget to hit your goals, and all of the Marketing & Sales tech tools…..but if you don’t have a PIPELINE CREATION METHODOLOGY that the whole company agrees to (especially the CEO & CFO), it’s going to be total CHAOS. 

And that’s exactly what it is. Have you experienced the Marketing portion of the Board meeting at a $50MM company? Nobody is speaking the same language. Investors and executives are looking at the data through a model built in 2012. The financial metrics are off track. Everyone knows it's a pipeline problem. But nobody can figure out why or what to do about it.

You need a PIPELINE CREATION METHODOLOGY. A comprehensive system to Create Pipeline predictably, scalably and at appropriate unit economics. That everyone in the company adopts. It’s standard practice in Sales (closing deals). It will take a few years but will be standard practice for Pipeline Creation too.

It’s crystal clear the band-aid solutions of hiring a new CMO or slapping Marketing technology on the problem aren’t working.

1. Figma is a giant w/ ~$750M in revenue in 2024, still growing almost 50% y/y. Very few public co's are anywhere close -- median last 12 month revenue growth was only 14%.

2. PLG & self-serve is a big part of the story. Figma has 450k paying customers. The vast majority are small: Figma only has 11k paying customers spending > $10k ARR & 1k spending >$100k ARR.

3. 76% of Figma's customers use 2+ products. In 2025 Figma doubled the product portfolio from 4 to 8 🤯 w/ the launch of Sites, Make, Buzz & Draw.

4. Net revenue retention is best in class at 132%, I suspect driven by a mix of self-serve > direct sales & multi-product adoption.

5. Perhaps more impressively, gross revenue retention is 96% w/ a big asterisk (Figma only reports GRR & NRR for customers w/ >$10k ARR).

6. The customer base is surprisingly global. 85% of MAUs outside of the US. 53% of revenue from non-US markets.

7. Yes, they still have a seat-based pricing. But there are now 5 (!) different types of seats: viewers, collab seats, content seats, dev seats & full seats.

8. Figma made big pricing changes in March 2025 & the results haven't hit their S-1 numbers. This included moving away from user-driven upgrades (hurts viral expansion, but gives admins more control) & a 20-33% price increase on full seats.

9. Even though Figma is a design product, 2/3 of users are non-designers.

Very cool to see such exceptional performance & metrics.

Why? Here it is 👇 

Eventually, you’ll run into unit economics challenges and data visibility challenges where you don’t know what to do with your Marketing and SDRs to keep scaling them. 

^^I’ve talked to more than 100 CEOs & CFOs that express this exact challenge

And here are the problems that come from this old, outdated ineffective way of pipeline measurement & department accountability:

1. Marketing - Forces all Marketing investments into a small part of the Revenue generation process called “lead capture”. 

-Complete imbalance of Marketing investments caused by the singular attribution model leads to massive diminishing returns where B2B companies way overspend on low quality lead generation 
-Improper measurement of Marketing investments make it incredibly complicated and subjective as to whether Marketing is performing at the level required for business scalability. 

*You should be able to know how well your Marketing is working or not with 2 metrics. 
*Marketing performance should be measured on a spectrum. *How well is it working*. It’s not binary. 

2. SDRs - No visibility to confidently scale or optimize the Prospecting process. 

-The only thing tracked is who books the meeting. But nothing about the WHY and HOW did we win
-The “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” planning and debate distracts everyone from the insights needed for scaling and optimizing Sales Development process

3. Sales - Sales sits at the bottom of the funnel and doesn’t have enough pipeline coverage to hit plan. 

-Lower quota attainment, lower PRP, forces Sales headcount adjustments 
-Sales starts doing prospecting and lead generation to make up for poor performance at the top of the funnel and creates an *unscalable* GTM motion with untenable unit economics. 

4. Finance - Poor financial performance and ZERO clarity on what to do to fix it. 

-Slowed growth, increased CAC, lower profitability, lower enterprise value 
-Strategic decisions are made based on someone’s opinion (e.g. CMO or CRO) instead of confidently based on data. 

___

“Inbound” was a Tech Vendor’s (Hubspot) Marketing message in 2013. And somehow 11 years later, it’s still considered a “best practice” across B2B. 

Meanwhile, the “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” aka Marketing vs. SDRs. vs. Sales vs. Partner Lead-source origination attribution model that’s widely adopted across B2B is the primary cause of unscalable unit economics and data visibility challenges. 

Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing all your GTM teams on lead source origination - a singular, totally sub-optimal attribution & planning model. 

Start planning, measuring and optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

Here’s what to do instead:

1. When it comes to “ROI”, focus on measuring the ROI of the *channel* instead of each individual piece of content. 

You don’t attribute the “ROI” of your results at the gym all to that 1 set of biceps curls you did 3 months ago. It makes no sense. But that’s effectively what B2B marketers try to do with content. 

Instead, recognize that the impact is based on the *accumulation* of consistent high quality activities executed over a sustained period of time. 

It’s easy to see that it’s more appropriate to attribute the “ROI” of your bicep results to all of the sets of bicep curls you’ve done in life, instead of a single set. 

You can do the same when measuring the success of content - measure the “ROI” based on the channel/activity. 

For create demand channels, use self-reported attribution. 
For capture demand channels, use software-based attribution. 

Using this method, we’ve attributed $7.3MM ARR to our podcast and $5.1MM ARR to LinkedIn. 

It sounds simple, because it is. 

2. THEN, when it comes to optimizing your content strategy, focus on measuring the *quality* of the activity (e.g. comments, engagement from target customers, DMs received, etc.). 

In the gym, you can measure what type of bicep curl you did, how much weight you used, and how many reps. This isn’t about attribute “ROI” but instead about measuring the *quality* of the activity. You can do the same with content:

You can read all of the comments & who wrote them (qualitative), you can listen to what people say in the DMs or on Sales calls (qualitative), you can measure engagement like “views” or “likes”. 

These signals help you optimize the activity - what topics resonate with my audience? what is the best time to post? how frequently should I post? Does video or text work better? - You get answers to important questions, but it has nothing to do with proving or measuring “ROI”. 

___

The whole mindset of measuring the “ROI” of a single piece of content persists from old thinking from the days of blogs and gated e-books in the early 2010s. That’s almost a decade ago. When people went into the office, used a desktop computer and consumed content offline in PDF format. 

Things change. 

In today’s World, it’s time to focus on the bigger picture. 

STOP trying to prove the “ROI” of each individual piece of content. 

Instead, understand that the results are built through the accumulation of tons of content & touch points over a sustained period of time. 

START measuring the “ROI” of each channel overall instead of by each individual blog or video.

Why?

Because the traditional playbook of spending $100k/month on LinkedIn ads to promote a gated e-book is clearly not working:

1. UNTENABLE ROI. CAC Payback periods > 60 months on “leads” generated from LinkedIn lead gen campaigns

2. SALES/MARKETING MISALIGNMENT. Sales teams close on average 1 out of 1,000 “leads” from a LinkedIn lead gen campaign. 

3. NO SCALABILITY. The terrible CAC and sales productivity metrics make this advertising strategy absolutely impossible to scale - you burn exponentially more money as you spend more. 

4. GTM BLOAT. The worst symptom of all. GTM costs exponentially inflate because of the low efficiency across the entire GTM engine leading to unprofitable and unsustainable performance. 

So, B2B companies really only have two options:

1. Stop spending money on LinkedIn Ads. Many companies are doing this and cutting $100k/month on LinkedIn ads and moving that money to spend even more on Google Ads. 

For most companies, this isn’t really a solution. The measurable ROI on Google Advertising is also very poor and they are already way past the point of degrading ROI on this channel. 

2. Develop a new strategy for HOW to execute LinkedIn ads. A few smart companies are doing this with massive success, yet the majority of companies can’t do this because of their outdated attribution requirements to deem ROI to a “lead”. 

__

LinkedIn advertising is the most powerful B2B marketing channel on the planet right now. You can distribute content to the exact decision makers at your target accounts for $0.03 to $0.07 each. 

It's by far the best use of variable marketing dollars compared to alternative investments like building a big tradeshow booth, spending another $100k/month on Google Ads, testing ABM display ads, or all the other large line item expenses on a marketing budget. 

Lots of companies like to blame the channel - ""LinkedIn ads don't work."" 

When in reality, they need to blame themselves - ""Our strategy for LinkedIn ads doesn't work"" 

What are you seeing with your LinkedIn ads strategy? How are you measuring success? Let's discuss 👇

1. We are bootstrapped and profitable. 

I accidentally started this ","Here’s why I’m confident Exit Five will win (and I’m not even being arrogant). 

1. We are bootstrapped and profitable. 

I accidentally started this company. It was a “creator” business first - with my newsletter and podcast in 2019. That was the seed that led to today. Exit Five did $1M in revenue while it was a solo business - which turned out to be the perfect angel investor. I decided to plow the profits into building a team in 2023 so we could build a real company. 

Today we have a full-time team of 6 soon to be 7. Things are growing. But we are in control of our own destiny and can grow at whatever pace I chose as the owner. 

2. We are building a great team. 

The team also gives us optionality here. Anyone who’s spent enough time in business knows that it’s not a platitude - people are the most improtant ingredient. If you get the team right, you can do anything. 

If our business went to 0 overnight - I’m confident we could rebuild something new with our team. I’m also a creator first (since 2014 if you check the receipts) so I like our odds if we ever needed to figure it out. 

3. I don’t give two fucks about the competition. 

Seriously. In all honesty. I like to watch and learn what others are doing - but it does not impact how we move. And that’s because point number one and two here - we are in control of our destiny, and I’m bullish on our ability to figure things about. 

But also because it’s not a zero sum game! I see it all the time. People can have multiple memberships to things. I have two gym memberships. I know Exit Five members that have other memberships to professional development groups and communities. 

There is so much freedom in knowing it’s not zero sum. We don’t need to dominate a market. I don’t need to create a new category. Everyone can win and we will too. 

4. We just unlocked something massive over the last year. We are not in the marketing education space. 

Nope. 

We are in the people business. 

We need to have marketing content and education - that is what will bring people in. But we are not out there touting our marketing expertise as being the best or the smartest. So dunk on our marketing takes all you want. 

We are in the business of connecting people who *work in maeketing* and that is the secret sauce. 

We also have thousands of people from around the world who want to share their marketing experience with our community because we have the reach and can amplify their voice in a way they don’t have by writing on their company blog. So we can teach through those experts - and spend our time focused on the people. 

Making IRL (and real online) connections possible - more important than ever today because of AI, slop, and fakes. 

So that’s why I’m confident Exit Five will win. 

And I don’t have to work 9-9-6. And my kids will actually know their Dad while I build a great company.

And just 1-in-1000 reach $10 million in less than a year!!

Thats not what you'd think if you only listen to VCs on Twitter.

You'd think if you're not at $100M ARR in 6 months you might as well give up.

Kyle partnered with ChartMogul and dug into their dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years and here's what he found: 

For startups that reach $1M ARR, it usually takes 2-5 years from monetization. 

1. Only 3.3% of startups reach $1 million in under 1 year
2. 13.4% reach $1 million in under 3 years
3. 25.1% reach that figure within 5 years

You can map yourself onto the curve below (see graphic). 

It takes time to find PMF and move from founder-led sales to repeatable growth. And premature scaling can kill a great business. 

That's why many of the best companies started slow:

- Lovable spent 18 months building before their breakthrough success
- Clay grinded for 6 years before seeing revenue traction
- Bolt spent 7 years to get to $700k ARR before their new product exploded

Tomorrow Kyle (Founder of Growth Unhinged) is joining me on Unf*ck My Startup LIVE to share the realistic playbook for sustainable startup growth.

If you're a founder feeling discouraged by hyper-growth narratives, this session will provide the data-driven clarity and actionable strategies you need to build a long-term, successful startup.

Something tells me things are different these days.

What brings me back: AI monetization. (Of course.)

I'm still astounded by the rate of change. In only the past few months: 
 - Salesforce introduced a new Flex Credit model for Agentforce
 - OpenAI shifted from seats to pooled credits for their Enterprise plan
 - Cursor introduced a credit-based model
 - Lovable made collaboration free & added rollovers
 - Grok added a $300 per month subscription

But it's hard to know what's really working. And it's unclear what buyers actually want -- aside from, perhaps, more predictability. 

I'm frankly excited to talk about this and learn from the best-of-the-best. I'll be at Monetize 2025 from the crew at Metronome. Pumped to see old friends (👋 Madhavan, Abde) & online friends (👋 Scott, Rob, Sam, Chris), plus hopefully make some new friends.

","We are not in the “Marketing needs to do more with less era”. This narrative is toxic and flat out wrong. 

The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS. 

---

To achieve proper unit economics, B2B companies must create approximately $10 in pipeline for every $1 they spend on Marketing and SDRs combined. 

Yet, the median performance across 50+ mid-market companies we’ve analyzed is only $3 in pipeline for every $1 in spend. 

That means Marketing needs 3X more budget to hit the desired pipeline goal. And companies need 3X more SDR headcount. 

So, instead of spending $10MM to produce $100MM in pipeline, they’d need to spend $33MM to produce the same $100MM in pipeline. 

This seemingly subtle difference cascades across the GTM machine and changes total CAC payback periods from approximately 18 months all the way to 50+ months - a crippling blocker to business growth and scalability. 

And even with the inflated spend, they likely still wouldn’t get to the goal since unit economics degrade with scale, especially when executed on accelerated timelines rather than measured and methodically. 

---

TLDR: Marketing doesn’t need more budget to hit the 2025 plan. 

What really needs to happen is for your GTM machine to create pipeline with proper unit economics that lead to scalable efficient growth and target sales quota attainment. 

Spending more money isn’t the answer. Making your existing spend work 2X-3X harder to achieve proper unit economics through smart, focused, disciplined execution is the real solution.

I sat in yet another meeting yesterday where Marketing, Marketing Ops, and Biz Dev leaders debated which attribution model they should use…..5 minutes in, I wanted to blow my brains out ☠️ 

I just can't take it anymore. These debates are useless.

The SDR leader wants a first-touch attribution model so SDRs get credit when they load leads into the database, citing that the SDRs get “demoralized” when they book a meeting that gets tagged as inbound. 

The Marketing team wants it to be “Marketing-sourced” if there’s any Marketing touch within 45 days. 

The Partner team wants it to get tagged as “Partner” and take precedence over everything when a Partner is involved. 

Every department just fights over credit for sourcing the lead, every department celebrates “sourcing” a % of revenue, while the financial planning model breaks down IRL and the company misses growth targets by a mile. 

Then - and this is the hilarious part - they try to fix the problem by changing the attribution model 😭 😭 

It’s like admitting you have a drug problem, and then deciding to switch from cocaine to meth. 

So, to reinforce the fundamental flaws of this approach: 

1. Using lead source attribution credit by department, regardless of which attribution model you use, is a terribly sub-optimal way to plan, measure, and optimize your GTM when you need to deliver scalable growth aka sustainable unit economics. 

2. Comparing Demand/Marketing (triggers and detects buying signals) with Prospecting (engage buyers 1:1 and book qualified meetings/opps) is like comparing apples to monkeys. They are NOT the same thing and any logical human would arrive at this conclusion with a small amount of critical thinking. 

3. Using this incredibly short-sighted and simplistic planning model forces all Marketing investments to appease the attribution model - skewing investments all to 1 part of the buyer journey (database capture) and causing extreme self-inflicted pain & dysfunction in the Pipeline Creation process. 

4. We should be measuring, comparing and optimizing the effectiveness of our Supply Chain (all of the 1st-party and 3-party signals that enter our Revenue Factory for Prospecting). 

5. We should be measuring, comparing, and optimizing the effectiveness of our Prospecting (all of our efforts to engage buyers 1:1 and create qualified opportunities, including AI, SDRs, and AE prospecting motions). 

___

If you spend just a small amount of time thinking about the current situation, you’ll too see that all of these debates & meetings & tech projects are a total waste of time. 

It's time for C-Level executives to fix the real problem. Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing your GTM like 4 low-quality department-level assembly lines. And start running your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

And CAC Payback periods have skyrocketed by nearly 100% in the same period. 

These two effects combined put massive pressure on core financial metrics, business profitability, and enterprise value. 

The root cause of this is Go-To-Market Bloat (GTM Bloat) where B2B companies invest significant money in Sales & Marketing and do not get the appropriate return on investment.

Sales & Marketing is by far the largest expense on a B2B company P&L - on average 40%-60% of total revenue; and 2-3X more than they spend on Product Development, Engineering, and R&D combined.

GTM Bloat occurs across the entire go-to-market, including People, Programs, Process, and Technology.

(1) People - Too many headcount on each GTM team, caused by outdated financial planning models, in addition to the overspecialization of roles on GTM teams (SDR, MDR, Solutions Consultant, AE, Onboarding Manager, CSM, AM, etc.). Or 90-person Marketing team that should actually be 35 people. Average sales quota attainment of ~40% is another clear indicator of headcount bloat.

(2) Programs - This mostly happens in the Marketing budget. B2B companies dramatically overspend on large scale events and digital performance marketing - up to 15% of total revenue - and do not get anywhere close to an appropriate measurable ROI on these significant expenses.

(3) Processes - Teams, meetings, reporting cadences to support programs that don’t work. SDRs to follow up with “leads” and get a meeting less than 1% of the time. Inefficient processes create significant bloat especially when operated at scale.

(4) Technology - Buying an ABM tool for $200k per year and barely using it. So much bloated headcount increases license & seat costs for all SaaS subscriptions by 2-3X. Too many $100k+/year point solutions used by 1 department or team and not integrated or essential to the full GTM.

__

Solving GTM Bloat is the #1 opportunity in a B2B company today to increase enterprise value. This is now a CEO, CFO, and Board Level issue.

Eliminating GTM expenses that do not provide appropriate ROI could increase EBITDA by 20% or more.

Restructuring the existing investments in GTM to deliver the appropriate effectiveness could increase growth rates by up to 2X (e.g. from 18% to 36% YoY).

Or more than likely, the solution is a mix of both of these - eliminating low ROI expenses to improve EBITDA and doubling down on strategies that are already working to create breakthroughs in growth rate.

Would you do it?

What if they added:

-0.05% equity

-One offsite in Florida

Of course not.

But that’s basically what it’s like to work inside a low-frequency company for $180,000 a year.

The infection just spreads differently.

You don’t catch it through the air.
You catch it through meetings, Slack threads, and investor updates.

You start to absorb it:

-The urgency
-The pressure
-The anxiety
-The constant feeling of not being enough

It spreads on three levels:

Biological: Your body syncs with the stress signals around you.

Behavioral: You mirror the worldviews, emotions, and habits of your environment.

Cultural: The group creates a shared baseline of scarcity, urgency, and pressure.

That’s how calm, capable people burn out in a year.
They don’t change overnight. They just adapt to the frequency of the company.

This is a flow of energy that infects the entire ecosystem: 

It starts at the cap table.
Extractive capital pushes for fast growth and quick returns.
The CEO and leaders absorb the pressure.
It flows down to teams who carry it forward.
Vendors, partners, and customers feel it next.

Soon everyone is operating from stress, scarcity, and survival while pretending it’s normal.

It's become ""normal"" in tech for people to feel this way.
But this is NOT normal.
It's a virus most people don't see (yet).

If you're tired, anxious, or restless even when things look fine on paper, this is why.

You're absorbing the frequency of your work environment, the one you spend most of your life in.

And the cost is far bigger than your paycheck.
It carries with you to your health, well-being, relationships, creativity, confidence, and everything in your life. 

It won't be long until all the best talent flows to high-frequency companies. 

High-frequency companies prioritize impact over external validation. Calm over anxiety. Clarity over urgency. Regeneration over extraction. Originality over comparison. Sustainability over speed. 

They energize and empower everyone (investors, leaders, employees, customers, vendors, partners) in the ecosystem. 

Once top talent feels what it's like to work in a high-frequency environment, they will NEVER work at a low-frequency company again. 

They will become ALLERGIC. And see it for what it really is - Like sitting in a room filled with a virus for $500/day. 

The future belongs to high-frequency companies.

Why I'm digging it:

1. The advantages of upgrading couldn't be more clear

With most products, I don't *really* know the difference between free & paid. Calendly makes it black-and-white. (This would also be very easy to fwd to a manager or anyone who asks ""can't you just use the free plan?"")

2. They've done the work of recommending a plan

I'm not choosing between 18 permutations of packages and add-ons. ""Based on your scheduling needs, the Standard plan seems like a perfect match for you."" 🤌

3. They play on loss aversion

Calendly has a reverse trial where new users start with a free 14-day trial, then downgrade to a free forever plan. This gives folks a chance to try things like multiple event types or automated workflows. 

Behavioral psych finds that people value things they own *a lot more* than things they don't.

2025 was a GREAT year for Exit Five. Took a bunch of lumps along the way, but today I can zoom out and see the whole year and I am proud as hell.

The team rocks, our community is strong, our reach is massive and I genuinely look forward to going to work every week.

We have invested so much in our team, the quality of our products, and the operating system of our company the past year and it shows.

But here's the best part: it's not just vanity metrics. Exit Five has made a meaningful impact on people's careers, professional networks - and as a result their lives (for real! people get jobs through E5, get raises, promotions, realize their boss is crazy and quit their job; they make friends, connections, find customers and more. our impact is very real and I feel it weekly).

-MQLs: 147% to plan
-Stage 0 Opportunities: 103% to plan
-Qualified Pipeline Creation: 64% to plan
-Sales Quota Attainment: 52% to plan

Marketing crushes their MQL target. Sales misses quota by > 30%.

Why does this happen over and over at B2B companies? It’s simple.

Because the “MQL” marketing metric is not aligned with closed won customers.

And to hit the 4,000 quarterly MQL target, the marketing team needs to do a bunch of stuff that drives high volumes of cheap, low quality leads that don’t buy. All the program budget goes to:

-Content Syndication
-Low Intent Google Ads to drive gated content downloads 
-High volume performance marketing on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. 
-Pay-per-lead programs 
-Google programmatic display ads and YouTube ads set to optimize for “max conversions” that drive a bunch of unqualified spam “MQLs” into website forms

The solution? It’s simple.

CHANGE THE GOAL.

The moment the executive team changes the goal from “MQLs” to Qualified Pipeline, all of the high volume lead gen tactics that drive significant Sales/Marketing misalignment immediately get thrown out the window.

Why? Because these programs don’t actually drive qualified pipeline. All they do is pump up a made up MQL metric. And the data in Salesforce clearly shows this EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Changing the goal to something that actually matters immediately forces a dramatic shift in the Marketing strategy and how investments are deployed.

With many companies facing Marketing budget cuts going into H2, there’s never been a better time to break the current MQL hamster wheel machine and start building the demand engine that will drive sustainable business growth over the long-haul.

“Blasphemy","You know something is seriously wrong when a simple statement like “CMOs should care about Marketing ROI” is met with extreme resistance. 

“Blasphemy” 

“Clickbait” 

“Focusing on ROI will ruin your Marketing”

This is clearly a troublesome reality. 

Especially for CEOs, CFOs, CROs, and PE Investors who understand Finance & Business, and simultaneously recognize that the failure to deliver appropriate Marketing ROI (unit economics) is what’s stalling growth for their company. 

1. Marketing that doesn’t drive revenue - i.e. create pipeline, increase win rates, or improve retention/expansion - is just arts and crafts. 

You aren’t in Marketing to make a cool video. Or “build a brand”. Or collect a bunch of leads. These are simply intermediate steps en route to deliver the real outcome - revenue growth and enterprise value. We don’t do “Brand Marketing” because it’s cool. We do it because, when executed properly, it drives the highest ROI when appropriately balanced with shorter-term strategies and investments. 

Measuring quarterly progress on TTM Marketing ROI is the most objective way to measure this. And you should be making positive strides and continuous improvement every single quarter. 

2. This wild reaction demonstrates that some Marketers are so closed-minded, that they refuse to even consider the validity and importance of this reality. 

Measuring the ROI on your GTM investments is totally different than trying to use attribution to measure the impact of an individual investment or channel. Take a step back and consider how *Business KPIs* differ from *Marketing Attribution*. 

3. It demonstrates that a lot of Marketers don’t really understand how business & finance works. 

SaaS companies that deliver high ROI on their Sales and Marketing investments receive a median 10X TTM Revenue Multiple. While SaaS companies that deliver low ROI receive a median 3.6X TTM Revenue Multiple.

So, delivering high ROI on Sales & Marketing investments makes a potential difference of $640MM in enterprise value for your $100MM ARR company ($360MM at low ROI vs. $1B at high ROI). 

—

So, please tell me again that optimizing for appropriate ROI on Sales & Marketing investments doesn’t matter 🙂 

#finance #sales #b2b #marketing #gtm 

Any CMO that says they don’t care about ROI should not be a C-Level executive.

Because the “C” in CMO means you are a BUSINESS LEADER first and the way you deliver business results is through the strategic execution of Marketing.

Great CMOs inherently understand this. An over-titled VP usually doesn’t. 

And FWIW….. Growth = Investment x ROI 

So anyone that cares about “Growth” must fundamentally care about ROI unless they have a never-ending piggy bank to blow money until the end of time.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chriswalker171_finance-sales-b2b-activity-7241433517572702208-8sVY?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAGLoUGQBRT5ZviEg8hAIca0e3yUXFWAvSdI,2024-09-16T13:11:29.918Z

The first wave was the movement to account-based (Right Fit). 

And the next wave that’s coming on strong right now is signal-based (Right Time). 

Signals are signs of intent that our buyers (people and/or accounts) send us that indicate some type of interest. 

Every time your SDR or Sales team takes an action to engage with a prospective customer, there is a “signal” that drives that action. Example signals might be:

Website - Demo Request
MQL Score
Intent Data - First Party - Pricing Page Visit
ZoomInfo - Cold Lead
Webinar Attendee
Intent Data - Third Party - G2
Intent Data - Third Party - Usergems 
Website - Content Download - XYZ E-Book
LinkedIn - Content Download - Lead Gen Form

And for a mature, developed B2B company, over a year, they would collect literally millions of data points around this.

Signal -> Sales Action -> Disposition (Recycled, Meeting Booked, Qualified Pipe, Closed Won)

And when you analyze those 1 million data points, you see clear patterns around what intent signals lead to high sales productivity, closed won revenue & sales velocity.

Conversely, you quickly see all the signals that Sales & SDRs take action on that are completely unproductive - total waste.

This data & insight are critically important to all GTM leaders. Because Sales resources are the most expensive resources in the entire company. And triggering them to take action on low quality signals means:

-We are wasting significant Marketing program and headcount investments to create buyer signals that don’t drive revenue.

-We have (sometimes extreme) excess of Sales & SDR headcount to take actions that are clearly unproductive and don’t lead to results.

-We likely have serious revenue leak in our early stage sales process because we blend tons of low quality leads with a small amount of high quality ones.

The problem? Most B2B companies, even highly successful ones, don’t track this data!

Here’s how to fix it in less than 30 days:

1. Every time your Sales team takes an action, automatically log the data of WHY they did it (what was the signal that triggered our Sales team to take an action).

2. Track the OUTCOME of every time your Sales team takes action. And then track it all the way to Recycled / Close.

3. Aggregate and analyze the data and find the patterns.

Once you’ve collected a meaningful amount of data, you will see clear patterns on what buyer intent signals lead to high sales productivity and which signals are entirely a waste of time for Sales to engage.

4. Optimize your entire GTM investments and strategy related to Intent Capture based on this data.

_____

In this new era of EFFICIENT GROWTH, we need to use DATA to optimize processes, identify and cut waste, and adjust investments.

Department-level analytics don't tell the full story. We need to look at the data as a HOLISTIC GTM - not analytics & data silo'd by departments.

• B2B marketing is not boring. That’s just a fun clickbait line we like to use to dunk on each other here. I don’t see how selling yet another seltzer online or hoodies is somehow “cooler” than B2B. We’ve met thousands of entrepreneurs and companies through Exit Five doing legitimately interesting things in B2B. So stop the B2B is not boring stuff. 

• One of the hardest parts about being a leader is having to sometimes sit back and let others shit on you online because you can’t tell the truth - because it does me no good to expose someone else online, so I just have to sit there and let some guy roast me for something. Or some other guy tell people I’m an asshole - yet we’ve never met! The best thing to happen to E5 in the last 2 years is in person because I get to look people in the eye, shake hands, and be real people in person. Everyone is smarter than you and better than you on the internet :) 

• I think most companies are stuck using marketing as defense. When the right way to deploy marketing is as OFFENSE. The Founder / CEO must care deeply about marketing because marketing is sales if you really understand it that way. Use marketing to play offense not defense. And sometimes the best marketing plays are not crazy - sometimes it’s quiet literally going to the side of the street that is not as crowded and selling your product over there.

But more than that, it forces us to rethink buyer journeys for AI discovery.

The team at Docebo told me AI discovery now accounts for 12.7% of their high-intent leads, up 429% (!) from last year. They're doing this with one dedicated team member (Valeriia) plus an assist from AI tools like AirOps & XFunnel.

Here's the thing: ChatGPT leads don't look like SEO or referral leads. 

They show up ready to buy, either going to your website directly (*after* they've made a decision) or searching for your brand on Google. Branded search now accounts for 85% (!) of Docebo's search traffic -- meaning 85% who come from Google already know about the company.

▶️ The old buyer journey: Problem awareness > feature research > vendor comparison > brand selection. 

▶️ The new buyer journey: AI-assisted research > network validation > direct brand search > selection.

The TL;DR:
1. Measure your AI search performance through self-reported attribution, branded search traffic, and share-of-voice in AI queries.
2. Late-funnel SEO is the foundation for great answer engine optimization (AEO).
3. The dirty work of AEO has to get done: updating, formatting, and structuring content for LLMs.
4. You can see tangible AEO results with a modern tech stack.

I sat in yet anoth","B2B executives don’t realize that department-level source attribution is the *cause* of their pipeline problem, not the solution. 

I sat in yet another meeting yesterday where Marketing, Marketing Ops, and Biz Dev leaders debated which attribution model they should use…..5 minutes in, I wanted to blow my brains out ☠️ 

I just can't take it anymore. These debates are useless.

The SDR leader wants a first-touch attribution model so SDRs get credit when they load leads into the database, citing that the SDRs get “demoralized” when they book a meeting that gets tagged as inbound. 

The Marketing team wants it to be “Marketing-sourced” if there’s any Marketing touch within 45 days. 

The Partner team wants it to get tagged as “Partner” and take precedence over everything when a Partner is involved. 

Every department just fights over credit for sourcing the lead, every department celebrates “sourcing” a % of revenue, while the financial planning model breaks down IRL and the company misses growth targets by a mile. 

Then - and this is the hilarious part - they try to fix the problem by changing the attribution model 😭 😭 

It’s like admitting you have a drug problem, and then deciding to switch from cocaine to meth. 

So, to reinforce the fundamental flaws of this approach: 

1. Using lead source attribution credit by department, regardless of which attribution model you use, is a terribly sub-optimal way to plan, measure, and optimize your GTM when you need to deliver scalable growth aka sustainable unit economics. 

2. Comparing Demand/Marketing (triggers and detects buying signals) with Prospecting (engage buyers 1:1 and book qualified meetings/opps) is like comparing apples to monkeys. They are NOT the same thing and any logical human would arrive at this conclusion with a small amount of critical thinking. 

3. Using this incredibly short-sighted and simplistic planning model forces all Marketing investments to appease the attribution model - skewing investments all to 1 part of the buyer journey (database capture) and causing extreme self-inflicted pain & dysfunction in the Pipeline Creation process. 

4. We should be measuring, comparing and optimizing the effectiveness of our Supply Chain (all of the 1st-party and 3-party signals that enter our Revenue Factory for Prospecting). 

5. We should be measuring, comparing, and optimizing the effectiveness of our Prospecting (all of our efforts to engage buyers 1:1 and create qualified opportunities, including AI, SDRs, and AE prospecting motions). 

___

If you spend just a small amount of time thinking about the current situation, you’ll too see that all of these debates & meetings & tech projects are a total waste of time. 

It's time for C-Level executives to fix the real problem. Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing your GTM like 4 low-quality department-level assembly lines. And start running your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

I started the SaaS benchmarks report at OpenView nine years ago now (!). Since then we've surveyed 5,000+ private B2B software companies including 800+ this year alone. I'm so excited to team up with High Alpha on the 2025 report and it *just* dropped.

Here's what GOOD and GREAT looks like by ARR band:

EARLY STAGE (<$1M ARR)
 - Growth: 100% (good), 300% (great)
 - NRR: 100% (good), 116% (great)
 - ARR per FTE: $55k (good), $100k (great)

^Top quartile growth is up over 2024 & 2023. Gross margins are down by ~5-10pts.

EARLY GROWTH ($1M-$5M ARR)
 - Growth: 50% (good), 100% (great)
 - NRR: 104% (good), 110% (great)
 - ARR per FTE: $135k (good), $200k (great)

GROWTH STAGE ($5M-$20M ARR)
 - Growth: 30% (good), 70% (great)
 - NRR: 104% (good), 110% (great)
 - ARR per FTE: $165k (good), $220k (great)

SCALEUP ($20M-$50M ARR)
 - Growth: 30% (good), 40% (great)
 - NRR: 103% (good), 110% (great)
 - ARR per FTE: $270k (good), $350k (great)

^Later stage companies are growing at about the same rate as last year, but they're doing so with far fewer employees. Best-in-class ARR per employee jumped by 42% for companies with $20M-$50M ARR.

The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS. 

To achieve proper unit economics, B2B companies need to create approx $10 in pipeline for every $1 they spend on Marketing and SDRs combined. 

Yet, the median performance across 50+ mid-market companies we’ve analyzed is approx $3 in pipeline for every $1 in spend. 

That means Marketing needs 3X more budget to hit the desired pipeline goal. And companies need 3X more SDR headcount. 

Instead of spending $10MM to produce $100MM in pipeline, they’d need to spend $33MM to produce the same $100MM in pipeline. 

And even with the inflated spend, they likely still wouldn’t get there since unit economics degrade with scale, especially when executed on accelerated timelines rather than measured and methodically. 

TLDR: Marketing doesn’t need more budget to hit the 2025 plan. What really needs to happen is for your GTM machine to create pipeline with proper unit economics that lead to profitable efficient growth and target sales quota attainment. 

Spending more money isn’t the answer. Making your existing spend work 2X-3X harder through smart, focused, disciplined execution is the real solution.

4) Once something sticks, improve it and make it better

At companies > $50MM, this resource drain and lack of strategic clarity is a 9-figure problem hiding in plain sight. 

This leads to either: 

(1) Inaction - Change nothing because it’s not clear what to do. 

(2) Uninformed Investments - to try to keep up growth rate, we spend more money but not intelligently and confidently based on data. The problem compounds 1-2 quarters later and becomes even harder to unwind.  

____

Your Go-To-Market KPI stack should: 

-Quickly, confidently isolate the biggest issue / opportunity in your entire go-to-market. 
-Easily, quickly, confidently evaluate the performance of your Marketing investments. 
-Tell you exactly how many SDR headcount you need 
-Align your entire executive team on the current performance, historical trends, and biggest opportunities. 
-Provide extreme strategic clarity around the fastest path to Growth and increased EV 

____

We have done 50+ of these analyses with middle-market companies in the past 12 months Passetto. 

In less than 2 weeks, the Passetto GTM KPI Stack answers all these questions. 

And the best part?….it has nothing to do with attribution. The data is OBJECTIVE. 

So instead of spending 3 hours debating the attribution model or questioning the data quality, we can spend the 3 hours figuring out the strategic plan and investments for how we move our #1 metric and add hundreds of millions of dollars in value to the business. 

These conclusions are *obvious* when you use ditch the old department-oriented demand waterfall model circa 2012 and instead analyze & optimize your GTM like it’s a revenue factory.

Hope this helps more folks tap into the 🪄 of the algo. 

1. Your first step on LinkedIn isn’t to post, it’s to comment.

Find 5-10 great thought leaders in your niche. Authentically engage with their posts, esp in the first hour. You'd be surprised how helpful this is in the early days -- and how few people do it.

2. Original graphics go a LONG way. 

The best performers for me: original data/research, screenshots that have been marked up. Think infographic-style, even if it's not really an infographic. You want to draw folks in & let them come to their own conclusions. Sankey diagrams are always 🔥 

3. Don't worry so much about putting a link in your post.

What matters is that you write zero-click content, i.e. the post has standalone value and folks don’t need to click on an external link in order to appreciate it. To be honest with you, about 50% of my posts now include links.

4. Keep to a consistent schedule of ideally 2-3+ posts per week. Sunday mornings work best for me (have no idea why!).

But don't worry about trying to post every day. Who has that much new to say, anyway?

5. Find a counterintuitive perspective. 

What's nobody saying that you will go to your grave defending? What's your pet peeve that folks are still doing? This doesn't need to be a hot take. Usually it isn't.

6. You can repurpose your greatest hits. Odds are most of your audience didn't see it the first time around.

I waited too long to do this. Now I try to refresh/repost on a ~6-12 month cadence & look for times when the post becomes topical again or for when I think of a better hook.

Started building it out in the spring and we launched the first group over the summer; we have a group of CMOs and marketing leaders doing $10M - $100M+ in revenue.

A CMO friend of mine reached out and wanted something more than the current Exit Five membership; she wanted a group of peers - a truly private place to share, connect, get unstuck.

• Every member signs an NDA to keep things private (so you can feel comfortable sharing org charts, budgets, venting about the CEO)

• You give us a list of 1-2 direct competitors that you do not want to be a member in the group, so you don't have to worry about any spies

• We have proven we can build an amazing community; we'll continue to do that - but now we're carving out a space top CMOs specifically, and the early results have been amazing. I keep asking Matt and Dan why we didn't start this earlier.

A bunch of top CMOs you know already in there. We put you in a group to start so you can quickly meet a bunch of people; we have a few proven formats for calls that you'll actually want to join.

Then you have a private space (Slack) to share ideas, post questions, get feedback. We've already built out a directory of tools, agencies, vendors that our top CMOs are using. Members are meeting on their own to discuss PLG strategy, how to re-design their bloated org chat, and how to set expectations with the board about AI.

I'm super bullish about this smaller group for Exit Five CMOs, and decided to break the plan internally and make a video about it this morning after I dropped my kids off at school.

But we have something for everyone beyond this:

They don't need ""B2B marketing examples"" to understand what might work in a B2B context.

I think one of the best parts of the job is marketing is that the ingredients are almost always different. Open the fridge and you've got to make a meal with three eggs, half a bagel, and an onion. But then at another company, the fridge is stocked full with fresh produce, grass fed beef, and a freshly tapped keg of kombucha (or something like that).

At each company the ingredients are different. Some companies are well funded. Some have no funding. Some companies have proven CEOs. Some have first-time CEOs. Sometimes you can attract Tier 1 talent (ex: Anthropic right now) and sometimes you can't because of the things i wrote before this; you might have to figure out how to start with Tier 3 talent and make it work. Some companies are in super regulated industries. Some have fewer rules.

But this is what's FUN. There is no formula. It's always different. Channels that worked for one company don't work for another.

This is the craft of marketing.

Here’s why I did it (and it","In 2019, I was one of the first people to post video content on LinkedIn consistently, and 5 years later, it paid off BIG. Here’s why I did it (and it’s not the reason you might think): 

Many people think I had some grand plan about video content. That it would be the future of LinkedIn and I saw something that other people didn’t see. 

But that’s not the case. In reality, it was so much more simple than that. 

I started posting mostly video content in August 2019 because tons of people plagiarized all my written content. 

I’d post content and wake up the next day to a half dozen people copying verbatim my exact post. Someone in the UK would just straight copy and paste it. Someone in Germany would translate it to German and write the same thing. Lots of people called it out but LinkedIn did nothing about it. 

So I thought to myself, they can’t copy a video. My face. My voice. My depth of understanding. So that's what I did. 

Video content created a whole new level of trust and credibility for me on LinkedIn because you can see and feel my understanding of the topics, my ability to explain them down to the exact metrics and root cause, and my conviction in the ideas based on tons of large-scale data. 

___

Lots of people still copy my content today. But now it’s happening differently for me and many other companies and thought leaders. 

Now people are copying my messaging. They trademark my language. They steal my ideas. 

But put most people to the test - put them in front of a crowd for a live Q&A. They’ll get detailed questions and break like cheap glass. 

Because it’s easy to copy words that someone else said. It’s not easy to fake truly understanding the market, the metrics, the concepts. 

Be warned: this already happens a lot in product marketing / messaging and will continue to accelerate. Everyone copies each other. It’s never been easier to change the copy on your homepage. 

One day they’re an ABM tool. The next day they sell intent data. The next day they are Sales Automation AI. They can keep jumping from messaging trend to messaging trend, copying whatever seems to be sticking as the flavor of the week. 

Because of this, there will be (it’s already happening) a huge shift in how product marketing works. In the future, the only things that matter are:

1. What your actual customers say about you to your prospective customers 
2. What your content consumers and community members say about you to your target market 

People will look at your website. But most people aren’t going to believe what you’re saying there. People will talk to your Sales rep (since they have to in most cases), but most aren’t going to believe them either. Or your fancy messaging deck. 

They will get the real information from your customers, content consumers, and community members. 

Because that’s one of the only trustworthy, believable sources of information left in B2B SaaS/Tech industry.

190,Chris Walker,0,447,61,18,526,504.2,0.89,"Everything in Marketing “works” to some extent. The real question is what is the impact relative to the investment (ROI). 

When evaluating Marketing ","Everything in Marketing “works” to some extent. The real question is what is the impact relative to the investment (ROI). 

When evaluating Marketing & Sales programs, it’s not a binary decision of whether this thing “works” or not.

It’s actually a spectrum - how well does it work? Or perhaps better framed as what is the ROI on this particular investment? 

You can see these binary statements of ""works"" and ""doesn't work"" all over LinkedIn and in Marketing QBR decks. A few examples:

1. “Outbound is dead”. 

No, outbound sales prospecting isn’t dead. The average B2B company we analyze captures in-market demand via Outbound to deliver 24% of new business revenue. The real problem is that companies are way over-invested in these programs and the ROI is poor. 

The real solution is to reduce investments in the Outbound programs relative to the results to improve ROI in the short-term. Then, adjust the Outbound strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the program over time - continuously increasing ROI. 

2. “Paid search works for us” 

Sure, paid search delivers attributed pipeline & revenue for most B2B companies that invest there. But the measurable ROI of this channel is usually super low. Most B2B companies we analyze get less than $0.50 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Google paid search (> 2 year Marketing CAC payback, > 4 year total CAC payback). 

With that type of ROI performance, it’s simply inaccurate to just say “paid search works”. The reality is most companies are losing money for every transaction via paid search. 

3. “Podcasting doesn’t work”

B2B companies don’t see Podcast showing up for leads in Attribution software and therefore make the binary call that Podcasting doesn’t work. The real problem is how it’s measured. Podcasting is a relatively low investment compared to programs like Paid Search or Tradeshow Booths, and therefore can deliver outsized ROI. 

One major issue is that Attribution does not factor in the cost/investment and therefore cannot make an informed decision of how well the programs are actually working. 

___

The days of deeming a GTM program “working” just because you closed a few deals attributed to it are over. All GTM programs now need to deliver results at the appropriate ROI relative to the investment. 

___

I’m excited for the evolution from Attribution to GTM Investment Analytics. You should be evaluating GTM investments through multiple lenses and data sets to make strategic decisions. Digital touchpoint attribution should weigh like 20% but most companies still weigh it 100% leading to strategic decisions and investment allocations that are often ineffective and don’t align to what customers do or want.

It might make it easier for people to work together. 

It might patch up the problem for a while that will come back to you in 3 months when you’re missing your pipeline for Q4.

The real solution? 

Redesign your GTM (aka the Factory that produces your revenue) - Starting with Financial Planning, Modeling, and Budgeting, and then working across the rest of GTM team to Sales, Marketing, Sales Dev, Ops, Post-Sale, etc. 

1. Build a Unified View of GTM with Financial Data & GTM Data that measures both performance (effectiveness) and unit economics (efficiency)

2. Align the entire GTM leadership team on a core KPI stack that has *nothing* to do with attribution by department or channel 

3. Categorize and evaluate GTM investment portfolio allocation by customer lifecycle stage, NOT DEPARTMENT. 

4. Methodically break down compound metrics to isolate the biggest issues / risks / opportunities by customer lifecycle stage

5. Build and align on cross-functional initiatives to solve the biggest issues in your Revenue Factory 

6. Monitor and evaluate impact against the core KPI stack that has nothing to do with attribution by department or channel.

1. More in person stuff. Big events. Medium events. Dinners. Hikes. Rage rooms. 30+ small events happening this year, available to members in different cities. 

2. Local chapters. Related to number one. Now have members in a dozen places leading other members online and offline. Amazing way to scale this community in a meaningful way. We didn’t invent local chapters - but we damn sure are using them. 

3. Marketing is more then SaaS. That was my background, so lot of early stuff skewed toward SaaS. Today we see the world is MARKETING. And some people work in SaaS. Just like some work in hardware. We now have industry specific groups and discussions that go well beyond SaaS. 

4. Matchmaking. Many people join to build a network. We help by connecting members 1:1 each month to help build their peer group. 

5. Roundtables / therapy sessions / all kinds of training - videos and live sessions available to anyone with a membership. 

6. AI trained on all of our stuff to help get you better answers and be a thought partner if you need it. Different than ChatGPT. 

7. A real team of six full time humans that care A LOT about delivering value and helping the people that work in marketing do better work and make connections.

I see it as this: 

We are not in the marketing hot takes business. We are in the people business. 
We can help you meet peers, get inspired, get unstuck, maybe even make some work friends. 

There are other communities and platforms you can join too - it doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. 

I’m not competing with anyone. And you should start a rival community if you think you can do better; let the market decide. Also I know today even a bunch of our members have multiple memberships to things. 

But we’ve been going now for three years, built on 15 years of my own personal experience and receipts - and I don’t plan on slowing down soon. 

We have product market fit + a team that gives a shit — and that’s an amazing tailwind to have.

The ROI of marketing investments is (often) really bad, yet gets defended by BS reports. 

Marketing measurement is flawed and totally disconnected from business financial results. 

The data collected around which department “sourced” the opportunity provides ZERO insights for optimizing the strategy and investments. All you can do with it is figure out where to point the finger about which department to blame when you miss your pipeline target (useless and unnecessary). 

Now they want to add PhD level statistics on top of incomplete, inaccurate touchpoint and impression data and think that’s gonna solve it lol. 

Or build an AI-Analyst to sift through the incomplete, inaccurate data in their data warehouse and think that’s going to get you accurate reporting and conclusions (hint: it’s not going to work and nobody at the C-Level or Board is going to trust it). 

And none of this helps you as a C-Level executive to align teams, drive strategy, allocate investments, and make confident decisions. 

Everyone is making this WAY more complicated than it needs to be. 

___

So, while everyone else goes more and more complicated to a level that nobody on the Exec Team or Board can understand….the real solution is to SIMPLIFY. 

1. Marketing is a Portfolio of Investments. 

If you break it down, there are LOTS of investments in the Marketing budget (see the video for all the examples), usually hundreds of individual line items. It’s not like you just need to babysit 3 investments. 

2. Just like a wealth investment portfolio, the Investments in the Marketing Portfolio have different purposes. 

You can’t measure the entire portfolio of Marketing and Sales Development investments in the same way, though that is what almost everyone is doing right now (with seriously underwhelming and confusing results). 

3. You optimize the portfolio of investments exactly the same as you would a wealth portfolio. 

4. Categorize the investments based on the GOAL/OBJECTIVE of the investment. 

5. Based on the OBJECTIVE, apply a consistent and specific measurement model to each category. 

6. Estimate the impact of each investment using the above methodology. 

7. Sort the performance top to bottom. 

8. With intelligence and thought and benchmark data, cut the losers, max out the winners, and test out new investments. 

9. Measure your top-level success and progress on the BLENDED impact of all investments. 

10. Wash, rinse, repeat every quarter using TTM and QoQ performance data.

Why?

Because the traditional playbook of spending $100k/month on LinkedIn ads to promote a gated e-book is clearly not working:

1. UNTENABLE ROI. CAC Payback periods > 60 months on “leads” generated from LinkedIn lead gen campaigns

2. SALES/MARKETING MISALIGNMENT. Sales teams close on average 1 out of 1,000 “leads” from a LinkedIn lead gen campaign. 

3. NO SCALABILITY. The terrible CAC and sales productivity metrics make this advertising strategy absolutely impossible to scale - you burn exponentially more money as you spend more. 

So, B2B companies really only have two options:

1. Stop spending money on LinkedIn Ads. Many companies are doing this and cutting $100k/month on LinkedIn ads and moving that money to spend even more on Google Ads. 

For most companies, this isn’t really a solution. The measurable ROI on Google Advertising is also very poor and they are already way past the point of degrading ROI on this channel. 

2. Develop a new strategy for HOW to execute LinkedIn ads. A few smart companies are doing this with massive success, yet the majority of companies can’t do this because of their outdated attribution requirements to deem ROI to a “lead”. 

__

LinkedIn advertising is the most powerful B2B marketing channel on the planet right now. You can distribute content to the exact decision makers at your target accounts for $0.03 to $0.07 each. 

It's by far the best use of variable marketing dollars compared to alternative investments like building a big tradeshow booth, spending another $100k/month on Google Ads, testing ABM display ads, or all the other large line item expenses on a marketing budget. 

Lots of companies like to blame the channel - ""LinkedIn ads don't work."" 

When in reality, they need to blame themselves - ""Our strategy for LinkedIn ads doesn't work""

I love my job; I love our company. And I'm also excited to chill out for bit and come back ready to go again in January. Both things can be true!

Some notes:

➡️ We doubled in revenue again this year; third year in a row we have doubled. Double-double-double. Not bad.

➡️ Added three new teammates. It's almost always a ""Who not Now"" problem now. People continue to be the most important thing to get right.

➡️ Got on a bunch of flights; did events in five major cities. Totally worth it. In-person is much different than online in the best way. Also gives me hope for humanity. We are better to each other in-person.

➡️ Big sigh. Made a bunch of mistakes of course. Wasted time and money. Burnt some social capital. Hurt some feelings. Inevitable. But still sucks. I tell myself that nothing bothers me but of course that's a lie. And I know there will only be more of it if the growth curve of success continues to accelerate. Also: business is just hard. You're doing business with people. People are complicated. So it's hard to chalk it up to ""it's just business.""

➡️ Much more positive note: realized that community is an incredible moat right now. Super bullish on the future with Exit Five and professional networks/community businesses. Feel very fortunate to be in the business we're in right now. Also the brand name, awareness, and recognition shift over the last year has been real. It feels different. In the best way.

➡️ Still bootstrapped, no outside funding, and profitable. And just went double-double-double. Who's mad at that?

All around just having a good time too; was saying to Dan (E5 CEO) the other night on the phone -- I never got my MBA. But the amount we're learning about business through building Exit Five has been a completely unexpected benefit.  The fact that we get to make money from the business is a bonus.

Understanding this truth will change your life 👇 

Every team, group, and company has a resonant frequency. 

Frequency is the composite of beliefs, emotions, actions, and intentions. 

It starts with the capital stack.
Flows to the CEO.
Cascades to the leadership team. 
And ripples across the entire organization. 

Frequency is highly contagious. 

If you don’t assimilate to the same frequency as the organization, you’ll either leave voluntarily or be kicked out.

Core Energy: Scarcity 
Leadership: Control + Micromanage
Pace: Constant Urgency + Burnout Cycles 
Culture: Competition + Zero Sum Game 
Motivation: External Validation

Energy: Draining Work + Constant Reactivity
People: Replaceable Resources

People: Irreplaceable Contributors 
Partnerships: Mutually Elevating + Values Aligned 

__ 

If you feel scarcity, urgency, pressure, burnout, like you’re “not enough” or that you’re “falling behind”... 

Look at your environment. 
Both physical and digital organizations carry a contagious frequency. 

And to realize it’s likely your work environment is causing that to you. 

If you stay in a low frequency company, you’re absorbing that energy. 

And you don’t just feel drained, confused and “not enough” at work. You carry that energy everywhere. 

Into your health. 
Into your finances.
Into your relationships, your creativity, your confidence, your clarity.  

That’s the cost. And sadly, many tech companies are quietly taxing their people like this every day. 

Protect your frequency. Nothing is worth trading it for.

Those of you who have followed me for a long time, know I’ve been challenging the SDR model since 2017. Because I looked at the data in 2017 and even back then it was clear this function does not perform when scrutinized against REVENUE. 

But back then, we were in the growth at all costs era and nobody cared. Executives and investors didn’t care if their SDR team had a CAC payback of 4 years. And to be direct, many executives I interacted with didn’t even calculate metrics like this. 

They just chalked it up to “this is how we do B2B Sales” and accepted it. Similar to how B2B companies build trade show booths every year, rarely get appropriate ROI from those investments, but still go every year because “we have to be there”. 

Now, we’re in the era of profitable, efficient growth, and companies need to rethink their entire GTM strategy, operating model, and cost structures. 

Finally, there is the pressure pushing down that forces companies to scrutinize all the things they do in GTM that they’ve accepted as “best practices” for 10+ years. 

For the SDR model specifically, I don’t think the right conversation is whether or not we should do outbound prospecting. And I’m not sure that will ever be the right conversation. 

Instead, I suggest GTM executives and companies start with a blank sheet of paper. Forget everything you’ve done in the past and workshop this topic together:

We need to do “business development”. How do we do business development in 2024? 

And if you had the discussion as a team of executives, you wouldn’t end up with a strategy where you have 22 year olds with auto-dialers calling CFOs and CISOs. 

As you iterate on your 2024 GTM plan, try starting with a blank sheet of paper. Start with first principles. Think about your customer and what they want. 

If you did, you’d certainly end up with an entirely different GTM strategy than what’s in place today.

But this doesn't mean e,"We're shifting away from charging for access to software and toward charging for the *work delivered* by software & AI agents. But this doesn't mean everything will become pay-as-you-go overnight!

If you're thinking about charging for work, consider these 8 ways to structure your pricing. (I like #6 the best.)

1️⃣ Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)

 - No commit, totally flexible 
 - Enterprise procurement usually *hates* this!
 - Works best when your customers can bill-back the expense or bake it into an operating budget
 - Otherwise, beware of the taximeter effect

2️⃣ PAYG with a cap

 - Caps the usage/spend to offer buyers peace of mind
 - Increasingly seen with outcome-based models where outcomes are unknown

3️⃣ & 4️⃣Usage-based tiers

 - Customers commit to a certain level of usage or tier (ex: up to 5,000 API calls per month); this is typically ""use it or lose it""
 - Two sub-flavors: high watermark (if usage exceeds the plan, folks immediately go into overages) or annual drawdown* (usage can be consumed flexibly, like a gift card)
 - Fear of overages + usage fluctuations encourages sales to over-sell & customers to over-buy

*I personally like the drawdown model. It gives the customer plenty of time to monitor adoption & plan for an early renewal/upgrade if usage is trending above their commit!

5️⃣ Platform fee + usage

 - Small level of commit helps 'lock customers in' and give them access to advanced features, support, etc.
 - Works well when the usage metric is getting commoditized (ex: SMS messages, compute, storage) -- you can advertise a low usage fee & make up for it with the subscription fee

6️⃣ Platform fee (includes usage) + usage, aka three-part tariff

 - Similar to the above, but with a larger subscription fee that includes some level of usage ""included""
 - Folks usually advertise the initial usage as a gift (""get your first 500 SMS messages for free!"")
 - Including a min level of usage helps get the customer hooked & usually incentivizes more overall consumption

7️⃣ Adaptive flat rate

 - The customer commits to a usage-based subscription, but can use the product as much as they want with no overages/upgrades during that period
 - Their tier resets up/down at renewal based on their actual usage behavior
 - Much more predictable for customers while encouraging them to increase consumption (downside is that you could be stuck with the costs!)

8️⃣ Platform plus success bonus

 - Communicate price as a subscription
 - If the customer gets a better ROI than expected, they pay a bonus
 - Works best if success = a hard ROI (ideally tied to extra revenue!)

--

I suspect most folks will offer multiple options as they seek to balance lands, expands & tough procurement convos. The downside: complexity.

And CAC Payback periods have skyrocketed by nearly 100% in the same period. 

These two effects combined put massive pressure on core financial metrics, business profitability, and enterprise value. 

The root cause of this is Go-To-Market Bloat (GTM Bloat) where B2B companies invest significant money in Sales & Marketing and do not get the appropriate return on investment.

Sales & Marketing is by far the largest expense on a B2B company P&L - on average 40%-60% of total revenue; and 2-3X more than they spend on Product Development, Engineering, and R&D combined.

GTM Bloat occurs across the entire go-to-market, including People, Programs, Process, and Technology.

(1) People - Too many headcount on each GTM team, caused by outdated financial planning models, in addition to the overspecialization of roles on GTM teams (SDR, MDR, Solutions Consultant, AE, Onboarding Manager, CSM, AM, etc.). Or 90-person Marketing team that should be 35 people. Average sales quota attainment of ~40% is another clear indicator of headcount bloat.

(2) Programs - This mostly happens in the Marketing budget. B2B companies dramatically overspend on large scale events and digital performance marketing - up to 15% of total revenue - and do not get anywhere close to an appropriate measurable ROI on these significant expenses.

(3) Processes - Teams, meetings, reporting cadences to support programs that don’t work. SDRs to follow up with “leads” and get a meeting less than 1% of the time. Inefficient processes create significant bloat especially when operated at scale.

(4) Technology - Buying an ABM tool for $200k per year and barely using it. So much bloated headcount increases license & seat costs for all SaaS subscriptions by 2-3X. Too many $100k+/year point solutions used by 1 department or team and not integrated or essential to the full GTM.

__

Solving GTM Bloat is the #1 opportunity in a B2B company today to increase enterprise value. This is now a CEO, CFO, and Board Level issue.

Eliminating GTM expenses that do not provide appropriate ROI could increase EBITDA by 20% or more.

Restructuring the existing investments in GTM to deliver the appropriate effectiveness could increase growth rates by up to 2X (e.g. from 18% to 36% YoY).

Or more than likely, the solution is a mix of both of these - eliminating low ROI expenses to improve EBITDA and doubling down on strategies that are already working to create breakthroughs in growth rate.

See the pattern? 

Marketing isn't going to fix your GTM problem. 

Marketing Leaders are responsible for deploying Marketing budget against Marketing objectives. 

But don’t expect CMOs (or any GTM Department Leader) to deploy their department budget to fix other departments' issues or cross-functional GTM problems. 

Even though Marketing Leaders see the problem. And they *feel* the problem. They won’t allocate their Marketing budget to fix cross-functional problems. And it’s no fault to Marketing leaders, that’s how it should be. 

This is a massive insight for every GTM leadership team:

When CEOs aren’t committed to personally owning holistic GTM, and instead delegate it down to GTM Leadership, transformational initiatives that get you to the next level of growth stall out and don’t get funded. It’s often too “risky” for a department leader to authorize them. Instead all their investments, time, and effort are spent to achieve the short-term department-level KPIs. 

The CEO, supported by the CFO, needs to take full ownership of designing and optimizing their Revenue Factory so that GTM Leadership and Departments are aligned and set up for success. 

They must own and drive the long-term strategic cross-functional roadmap for their Revenue Factory. Just like they have a Product Roadmap for the next 2+ years. 

They are the only ones who can set and deploy investments outside of department-level budgets to solve cross-functional problems. 

They are the only ones who can authorize a $2MM investment to a new strategic initiative that may fail, but if it succeeds, it lowers CAC by 50% and adds $500MM in enterprise value to the company. 

Department leaders most often can’t and won’t make these calls. 

If you want to take your GTM to the next level, you *need* the CEO and CFO to own and drive it, supported by GTM leadership and RevOps.

210,Chris Walker,0,423,59,17,499,504.2,0.84,"B2B go-to-market teams have a massive analytics problem: survivorship bias.

Every report, technology, team, and department are only looking at the data around the times that they win. 

The bottoms-up reporting framework has every single team and budget holder across the GTM focused on ""proving the ROI"" of what they're doing, so executives only see reports about how well everything is working. 

This is a behavior pattern built during the growth-at-all-costs era. Where it didn’t matter about efficiency. If we could get 1 more customer, it didn’t matter how much it cost. 

But those days are over. Now we’re in the era of profitable efficient growth. And B2B go-to-market strategy and investment analytics need a transformational makeover. 

So, what’s the fastest way to optimize your go-to-market strategy and investments? 

Flip the paradigm completely. Instead of looking at only the times you win, look at all the data around all the times that you lose and start to systematically eliminate them. 

B2B Sales & Sales Development resources - the most expensive resources in the entire company - will take action and LOSE more than 99% of the time. 

Significant Marketing investments are made to create “leads” that lose 99.9% of the time. 

SDRs arm the spam cannons to follow up with those shitty leads and lose > 99% of the time. 

So much money spent to create pipeline and nowhere close to the appropriate return on investments. 

Then there’s over bloated Sales headcount sitting at the bottom of the funnel with nowhere close to enough pipeline opportunities to hit the plan. Which is why average Sales rep quota attainments sits around 35-45%. 

The financial dynamics within a B2B company have fundamentally shifted. We need to follow suit with:

1. New go-to-market financial planning models built on efficiency
2. New analytics strategies focused on optimizing the holistic GTM, not “proving the ROI”
3. Significantly more discipline and balance around how we deploy investments across the entire GTM (create pipeline, close in-market accounts, and renewal/expansion). 

The fastest way to get there is look at all the times that you LOSE and start cutting those investments and tactics out of the mix.

Eventua","What’s the biggest problem with planning, measuring, and optimizing your GTM based on “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” vs. “Partner” ?

Here it is 👇 

Eventually, you’ll run into unit economics challenges and data visibility challenges where you don’t know what to do with your Marketing and SDRs to keep scaling them.

^^I’ve talked to more than 100 CEOs & CFOs that express this exact challenge

And here are the problems the “Four Funnel” department-level lead source attribution & planning model causes across the revenue factory:

1. Marketing - Forces all Marketing investments into a small part of the Revenue generation process called “lead capture”. 

-Complete imbalance of Marketing investments caused by the singular attribution model leads to massive diminishing returns where B2B companies way overspend on low-quality lead generation

-Improper measurement of Marketing investments make it incredibly complicated & subjective as to whether Marketing is performing

*You should be able to know how well your Marketing is working or not with 2 metrics. 
*Marketing performance should be measured on a spectrum. *How well is it working*. It’s not binary. 

2. SDRs - No visibility to confidently scale or optimize the Prospecting process

-The only thing tracked is who books the meeting. But nothing about the WHY and HOW did we win
-The “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” planning and debate distracts everyone from the insights needed for scaling and optimizing Sales Development process

3. Sales - Sales sits at the bottom of the funnel and doesn’t have enough pipeline coverage to hit plan

-Lower quota attainment, lower PRP, forces Sales headcount adjustments
-Sales starts doing prospecting and lead generation to make up for poor performance at the top of the funnel and creates an *unscalable* GTM motion with untenable unit economics

4. Finance - Poor financial performance and ZERO clarity on what to do to fix it

-Degrading financial metrics - Slowed growth, increased CAC, lower profitability, lower enterprise value
-Strategic decisions are made based on someone’s opinion (e.g. CMO or CRO) because we don't have the right data

__

“Inbound” was a Tech Vendor’s (Hubspot) Marketing message in 2013. And somehow 11 years later, it’s still considered a “best practice” across B2B.

Meanwhile, the “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” aka Marketing vs. SDRs. vs. Sales vs. Partner lead-source origination attribution model that’s widely adopted across B2B is the primary cause of unscalable unit economics and data visibility challenges.

Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing all your GTM teams on lead source origination - a singular, totally sub-optimal attribution & planning model.

Start planning, measuring & optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

It’s seen as the most “objective” source about why you’re better (or worse) than alternatives. Exec teams obsess over it.

2. Tech companies go on a buying spree for media & community assets. 

We saw a wave of this in 2021-2022. HubSpot & The Hustle. Pendo & Mind the Product. Semrush & Backlinko. 

The rationale back then was SEO. The rationale now will be AEO. (Plus media brands have always been >> than software at building an organic audience. Software is >> at monetizing an audience.)

3. PLG loses its appeal (again) as AI companies shift attention upmarket to bigger deals & stickier customers. 

The retention rates on <$50/month AI products are… not great. (I’m trying to be polite.)

4. People stop using automation as a 💪 and prioritize AI that improves *quality* (conversion, CSAT, accuracy). 

Everyone knows AI can make companies more efficient. But can it improve performance?

5. Direct mail/gifting comes back in style as a way to reach buyers.

People are back in the office. A thoughtful gift gets opened & remembered more than 10 automated emails. 

6. Competitive differentiation becomes the top Board level priority. 

This might not have mattered much when there was so much market pull for AI. But deals will increasingly become a knife fight. Too many AI products still sound & look the same, and buyers don’t know how to decide.

1️⃣ Sell to the right customer.

I've seen products where annualized retention can range from 50% to 90%+ across different types of customers. Selling to the right ICP who values your product is often the top change that moves the needle.

2️⃣ Stop overselling on the 1st deal.

It's usually better to start smaller, prove value quickly, and then unlock growth opportunities in the future. This also leads to faster sales cycles.

3️⃣ Market to your customers.

Marketing isn't only for prospects. Your existing customers should hear about the latest features, learn best practices and get connected to a peer community.

4️⃣ Nail onboarding.

A surprising % of folks who churn never really effectively launched in the first place. (This is especially true for PLG/self-serve).

5️⃣ Set up integrations.

When your product is embedded in the customer's workflow & other systems, it's hard to rip-and-replace. Three reasons why: (a) connected data, (b) easier user adoption, (c) use case expansion.

6️⃣ Solve more problems.

By broadening use cases for your product, you get more champions who'll go to bat for you at renewal (which is especially important if your original buyer leaves). 

7️⃣ Give yourself more time.

Moving from monthly to annual (or multi-year) plans can be controversial. But IMO you're usually better off because you have more time to impress the customer & the customer is more motivated to implement the product.

Every team has a role to play in preventing churn.

216,Chris Walker,0,412,194,17,623,504.2,0.82,"Not focusing on or being accountable to Marketing ROI is the #1 reason why I would fire a CMO. 

Because when your ROI is 2x (super low performing), y","Not focusing on or being accountable to Marketing ROI is the #1 reason why I would fire a CMO. 

Because when your ROI is 2x (super low performing), you spend $10MM on Marketing & SDRs and get $20MM in pipeline. 

And when your ROI is 10x (high performing), you spend the same $10MM on Marketing & SDRs and get $100MM in pipeline. 

This difference fundamentally solves the growth challenges for a mature company. It fixes pipeline coverage, sales quota attainment, growth rate, unit economics - Everything that matters. 

But lots of CMOs don’t track it and sadly don’t care about it. 

This is why lots of CEOs, CFOs, CROs, and PE Investors everywhere are increasingly questioning and underwhelmed by the performance of the Marketing department. 

And here are the excuses you hear from CMOs that miss pipeline targets and get poor ROI from their Marketing budget: 

“Marketing takes time” 
“We need to measure the time lag” 
“We’re doing it for brand” 
“Check the multi-touch attribution report for how everything is working""
“Our Marketing investments won’t pay off until next year and 2026” 

Wrong. 

A CMO must be able to implement strategic changes to investment allocation, core KPIs, cross-functional processes, and Marketing strategy to grow pipeline, improve unit economics, and make an impact on short-term business metrics. 

And Marketing investments MUST deliver appropriate ROI in period (TTM). 

It’s the CMO’s responsibility to deploy the investments appropriately to balance the short-term and long-term return. 

#finance #gtm #gotomarket #marketing #b2b 

p.s. Lots of CMOs will say they don’t care about ROI. They deploy a $30MM/year budget, get an awful return on the investments, miss their pipeline and revenue targets by a mile. And then after a terrible 2024 performance, they plan on doing same things with the same budget for 2025 (insanity). 

Any CMO that says they don’t care about ROI should not be a C-Level executive. 

Because the “C” in CMO means you are a BUSINESS LEADER first and the way you deliver business results is through the strategic execution of Marketing. 

And FWIW….. Growth = Investment x ROI ;) 

So you have two options: 

1. Keep increasing the budget with terrible unit economics until the model breaks and your company is worth less than the amount of money you’ve raised. 
2. Keep the budget the same (or lower) and improve the blended ROI of all of the investments. 

It's not complicated. 

Being more *efficient* in your go-to-market doesn’t mean you grow slower.

1. Fin went $1 to $12 million in a year -- more than a year ago.
2. On track to cross 30k paying customers by end of year.
3. Annualized growth is 393% (as of Jun '25).

5. AI resolution rates increased from 23% (May '23) to 67% (Nov '25).

Intercom is THE case study for anyone pivoting from SaaS to AI agents. Co-founder Des Traynor just joined the Mostly Growth podcast to share what he's learned.

My top five takeaways from Des. Listen to the full podcast here: https://lnkd.in/edWkdZgV

1. Every marketing channel that would've worked in the early days of Intercom has gotten harder.

Most things are a lot easier now, except for getting attention. My favorite quote: ""Every legitimate channel has been growth hacked to shit.""

2. There's a classic pattern: People will expand marketing channels until they become slop.

All else being equal, the extra blog post or extra email gets more visits. But at the silent cost of degrading your brand and eroding trust.

3. Marketing is shifting to IRL events like dinners and meetups.

""We find ourselves looking for things that are obviously authentic and aren't hackable."" Events are one of the rare channels that can't be easily faked.

4. Everyone's AI product has the same messaging. And the UI looks the same, too. Competitive differentiation is the next battlefield.

The real test is how many customers (a) discovered the product organically, (b) are happy with the decision, & (c) are seeing real business impact.

5. Pricing is a type of marketing. Startups always need to leave something on the table.

We’ve seen this story before:

🚖 Uber & Taxi Drivers

-Lured in drivers with promises of freedom, flexible income and better pay. 
-Once supply flooded the market, they slashed driver pay to maximize margins.
-Now moving to automation with Waymo and self-driving fleets, cutting drivers out completely.

📦 Amazon & Warehouse Workers 

-Scaled on the back of human warehouse workers - brutal shifts, quotas, and exhaustion.
-Over time, they layered in robots, automation, and AI logistics to improve profitability. 
-Now, the workers who endured the grind are being phased out by machines. 

Grindcore is not new. It’s a recurring extraction model:

1. Lure people in with promises.
2. Grind them down for profit.
3. Replace them with machines.

It’s ironic this post is landing on Labor Day.

Labor Day was created in 1894 because society recognized the cost of overwork and exploitation.

Back then: factory workers were being worked 12+ hours a day, 6–7 days a week, with little pay and no protection. Strikes and protests erupted across the country.

Congress rushed to make Labor Day a federal holiday, a gesture to honor workers and acknowledge the abuse.

Back then: factory workers. 
Today: knowledge workers are being brainwashed into Grindcore.

Same dynamic. Just digitized.

Work should serve your life, not consume it.

The future belongs to high-frequency work:
Regenerative. Purpose-driven. Human.

Don't fall for the illusion. There's nothing noble or glamorous about being a modern-day slave.

- But are also cool people in real life like you are too - with hobbies, interests, families (imagine that!)

 - Microsoft announced AI credits for Copilot in M365 in January

I suspect *most* AI spend is probably now in the form of credits, which are also referred to as tokens, AI units, generative credits and flex credits. Clay is a great example (see below) & software founders increasingly tell me their pricing was inspired by Clay.

While none of the big players are the first to introduce it, they’ll make it *much easier* for the next company to sell AI credits. Why:

1. Large incumbents validate that it's a 'standard' way to buy AI apps

2. Salesforce, OpenAI & others will educate the market about how to buy credits (won't those be fun procurement convos!)

3. Presumably, large incumbents are making these moves after extensive research w/ customers -- indicating that a lack of predictability isn't an insurmountable roadblock

In today's Growth Unhinged I unpacked why everyone's switching to AI credits & how to do it yourself. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/edDCXget

The TL;DR: Honestly, I’m torn about credits. I can’t imagine the headache of managing dozens of AI products that all have credit allowances. But for now AI credits can be a lifeline -- just not the endgame.

And it’s one of the best pieces of evidence I've seen in support of reverse trials.

For B2B SaaS companies, about 5% of new trialists convert from free-to-paid within 6 months. (In B2C, it's closer to 20%.)

Of these conversions:
 - HALF (!) happen within the first 7 days
 - 70% happen within the first 14 days
 - 90% happen within the first month
 - But only about 3% happen in months 3-6

The data comes from my friends at ChartMogul who looked at the GTM and conversion data of 2,500+ SaaS companies.

Look, the immediate takeaway of this data is that you have a very narrow window to impress trial users. Usually within the first week -- if not sooner.

My two cents about what to do with this data: re-engage signups post-trial! 

1. Consider a 'reverse trial' -- letting folks downgrade to a freemium plan if they don't convert within the trial period.

Why? This gives users more time to see value. It then creates additional conversion opportunities over time: users hit a CTA in the product, they run into a feature gate, they trip a usage limit. And they can become product-qualified leads for the sales team.

In my recent State of B2B Monetization survey, still only 4% of software companies have a reverse trial. That's about one-tenth the rate of free trial/freemium.

2. Auto-extend free trials for accounts who reached an 'aha moment' but didn't buy.

Why? In my experience, about 25-40% of new signups reach an 'aha moment' within their first week. But this data shows only about 5% of folks are buying. That leaves 20-35% of signups reaching and 'aha moment' and NOT buying!

Depending on user signals, you could take a 'smart trial' approach to either (a) enforcing the trial time-limit, (b) extending the trial period and/or (c) collecting data on why they've decided not to buy. 

3. Periodically re-open trial windows, especially around major milestones like new product releases or events.

Why? Your product is constantly improving. Make sure lapsed trial users see that and have a chance to experience it firsthand!

It's a cool report, I'll drop the link in the comments.

It sounds great and easy in theory, so they can divide lead source credit between Marketing, Sales, SDRs, and Partners. But it will 100% fail in practice. 

Because they are taking the outdated, ineffective MQL Demand Waterfall Model from 2012 - that doesn’t work in today’s environment due to unsustainable unit economics - and breaking it into 4 smaller MQL Demand Waterfall Models based on department lead source credit that also won’t work. 

They’re going to spend 6-12 months implementing it in their CRM and it’s 100% not going to fix their GTM problem. Ironically, it’s going to make things worse. 

I understand this model deeply, have implemented it many times, and personally recommended it from 2018-2022. But it will 100% fail in today’s environment because it does not produce SCALABLE UNIT ECONOMICS. 

This highly inefficient model makes it “easy” for Finance to do annual planning and try to measure ROI yet basically impossible to scale, plan, forecast, diagnose, and optimize.

For mature companies, billions of dollars in enterprise value are on the line over the next few years……So be careful where you get your advice from - 

All of the “best practices” and “framework” B2B companies get from Gartner, Forrester, and Tech Vendors were built for the Growth at All Costs Era and *do not* work in today’s environment where sound unit economics are fundamentally required. 

Stop using attribution as your KPIs. Start planning, measuring and optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

-Content Syndication (Spread out across 5+ vendors)

-Trade Show booths / Field events 
-LinkedIn lead gen programs 
-Buy an ad to get an account on our website so we can call it an MQA
-The list goes on an on 

And the reality is very few companies track, measure, and analyze the *outcomes* of these signals. 

There are signals where tons of Marketing dollars get spent and tons of SDR human capital is invested that literally generate $0 in pipeline, but they never see it because they don't track the data. 

When you track and analyze signals, you get IMMEDIATE, CLEAR, FAST insights about how to optimize your Sales & Marketing investments. 

Both at a global level - i.e. these are things we do that never work across all segments and regions - cut them.

It took another 3-5 years for a majority of B2B executives to see the same reality I was seeing. And by 2021-2022, the true idea of “Demand Gen” and how to execute Marketing to augment the performance of the entire GTM became commonly accepted. 

__

Now, it’s 2024 and it’s clear to me that DATA is the biggest issue inside of B2B companies and Go-To-Market (GTM) Teams. 

Most executives don’t see it yet, but to me it’s obvious. 

Because established B2B companies have incredible products, tons of happy customers, esteemed investors and brilliant people. 

So if all of those important pieces are in place, then why is the average tenure for a CMO less than 2 years? 

Why is the average tenure for a CRO less than 2 years? 

Why is the GTM C-Suite basically a revolving door? 

Why are CAC payback periods for private companies 3 years or more? 

Why is Sales quota attainment less than 40%? 

It’s because of the DATA and How It’s Used to drive strategic initiatives, investment allocations, core KPIs, planning & modeling - all the things that matter. 

Most B2B executives don’t see it yet. Just like in 2017 when I identified Marketing as the biggest issue, but for literally years my insights fell on deaf ears. It took most companies and executives another half decade to truly see and internalize the same thing I saw. 

Executives and companies that recognize this early and move will yield massive dividends, compounding growth, and a true competitive advantage. 

Because having the right data to make important strategic decisions leads to speed, rapidly improving ROI on Sales & Marketing investments, new strategies & initiatives that set you apart from the competitive set, and a whole lot more. 

I’ve seen this cycle before. 

For those of you that capitalized on my insights related to Marketing over the past 5 years, I implore you to read this post deeply and internalize that the biggest leverage point in your entire company is Go-To-Market Data and how you leverage that data to make fast, confident decisions around strategy, investments, and key initiatives.

Now they tell me they were inspired by Intercom, HubSpot, OpenAI and Clay.*

What folks love about each:

1. Intercom: Outcome-based pricing pioneer, charging $0.99 per AI resolution (Fin). 

But, really, it's a hybrid model. Intercom charges per seat for its helpdesk and for its AI copilot.

2. HubSpot: Famously introduced contact-based pricing a decade ago. It more than paid off.

Today, HubSpot is known for balancing self-serve & enterprise, successfully going multi-product (several times over) & being far more transparent than other folks.

3. OpenAI: Set the reference price for AI products (and the cost for AI tokens). 

Increasingly, folks are watching OpenAI's evolution from unlimited/flat rates to hybrid pricing and from $20/seat to $200+ for its most advanced AI.

4. Clay: Early adopter of hybrid pricing, combining subscription packages with credits.

I'm not the biggest fan of copying pricing. But there's a lot to learn from these folks. 

*PS, this isn't just anecdotal. It's based on data from the 2025 State of Monetization survey. And, yes, folks still copy Salesforce and Slack, too.

Because ""who's in the room"" is the entire value prop, and we've taken everything we've learned from three years building Exit Five to bring this together.

VPs and CMOs at this level need a peer group; a place to turn outside of work where you can ask questions about everything: 

• Compensation - what should you be making at this level?
• Equity (""Hey I'm 4 years in, what is my equity worth? anyone go through an exit or sell secondaries?""
• Internal relationships like working with the CEO; or how the CMO and CPO should work together
• Honest recommendations about vendors and agencies (""do not spend $100k on this vendor, trust me it's a cluster fck)
• Gut checks for all the things that come up at work that you don't have a friend to text and ask about (""I am battling with my CFO on this, am I crazy or is he?"")
• Or even just ""Hey what are you getting your team for a holiday gift this year?""

Each month we run calls designed around a topic that matters right now (ex: last month there was a breakout group around Org Design; then one on Budgeting for 2026) - but it's not me or Matt or the Exit Five team talking; it's the VPs and CMOs. Sharing what you are doing, where you need help.

We are simply the hosts of the party and the facilitators, but that's our secret sauce. Pulling together the right people in the right room - and knowing what B2B marketing leaders care about.

We're like the friend that you want to give the Aux cord too.

It’s your OWN MIND.

Tools come and go, even the best of them, but you’re stuck with your own mind forever.

Exercising it is now easier than ever as AI gives you tremendous leverage and also forces a great burden upon you—weeding through AI slop (not the EMDASH kind).

Put down the screen, let go of your credit card, don’t buy tools.

First think, “if I could do anything right now, with perfect information, what would I do?”

Then have AI help you get as close as possible to that goal.

For once in our lives we finally aren’t confined by our tools as we have a form of intelligence.

But yet, I still see people use this tool to:
1. Personalize messages
2. Figure out which toaster to buy (me too)
3. Ask it the weather 
4. Ask it to write an email
5. Use it like google

Stop thinking from our current toolset and frameworks.

Begin thinking, “if I had all of the world’s knowledge right here in my pocket, what would be the most leverage I could get from it in my job.” 

Hell, even ask AI that question.

We have a thinking partner that never gets tired, never sleeps, who no complex question is too hard, and who can convincingly bullshit.

But if it doesn’t have a good sparring companion, then all it will do is slap you in the face and convince you it loves you and that you’re right.

The worst part is, if you don’t reflect, you may find yourself taking a pregnancy test because of how hard AI just screwed you.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_theres-only-one-tool-you-need-in-2026-activity-7395585141491888128-bg9U?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACqRF94B9TvM9f-BCXT--XyBrhkxvy6s_7c,2025-11-15T22:15:01.059Z

There’s an insidious thing about AI, maybe the most dehumanizing part…

That it makes me question how genuine people are based on the quality of their writing. 

As if they write like AI, I tend to round down and think even less of the message. Like somehow bad message written by a computer is even worse.

I hate questioning if the person sucks at messaging or they suck at using AI, because it’s kinda a question of what is genuine.

Let’s break this message down:

Pros:
1. It talks about me and my post.
2. It connects my value prop with what I do.
3. It mostly feels personalized, like it was written for me.

Cons:
1. It’s so so long.
2. It uses the word “interesting” which is the least interesting word in existence.
3. It says a lot without communicating anything specifically, classic AI sign.
4. It’s asking for 15 mins (a terrible amount of time, like it’s 30 or bust for me)
5. It talks about networking — No busy executive wants to network. They want to solve problems.
6. It’s just so generic as to make me feel the call will be an utter waste of time as there’s no SYNTHESIS of information.

Now contrast tho next message, which is about a specific piece of content, uses the word ingenious, is not asking me for time, and feels authentic to me.

Here’s an exercise, just write yourself a cold message YOU would happily respond to…

Here’s mine…

“Jordan, I’m 42 minutes into your video on systems of actions, systems of record, and systems of information and it’s been 3 months, what’s changed in how you’re building systems of information?”

Or here’s another one,

“Jordan I’ve heard from some friends that you do $3k campaign builds live for people in 2 hours? Can I buy that.”

Or this one,

“Jordan, I run a startup backed by a16z that builds an AI SDR for just logistics companies and we’re building it based on 17 public data sets and we’d like to make you an advisor.”

Or this one,

“Jordan I am pretty sure you’re wrong about Claude Code’s agent mode replacing Claygent—I could only get it to work for like 200 rows. What’s your secret?”

Notice that all of these messages carry specificity, they embed my point of view (the AI SDR one I would take that call because they have talked about HOW they are doing it and made choices that makes it unique).

In the other case, they want to pay me, BANGER!

In the first case they have focused 100% on my ideas, which makes me believe they literally care about the ideas. Which I love talking about of course!

And the last message is actually true, I was wrong!

There’s a thing in blockchain called proof of work, Sam McKenna says it as show me you know me, but I don’t think either of these are useful anymore.

As there are more demands on my time, I dont want you to prove you have read my things, I want you to demonstrate that you have synthesized them, disagree with them, have a damn opinion.

And in a world of AI, the winners will be those who can not just write well, but think well.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_i-just-feel-so-much-apathy-theres-an-activity-7389292488991129600-Phw7?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAETfp90Bp8z87J9S2JZUOFkUrgejl3ypNlg,2025-10-29T13:30:15.791Z

1. Beat the Sun Up. I get 10+ important things done before most people wake up. I tried 4am for a while but 5:40am is where I eventually landed.

2. Consistent Bed Time. Asleep by 9pm so I get 8+ hours of high quality sleep M-F. It makes more of a difference than you think.

3. Early AM workout 7 days/week. Lots of people say take a day off, but workout 365 days / year works for me. Find what works for you.

4. No Weekend Hangovers. Fucking off on weekends kills momentum.

5. Morning Journaling. 15 minutes of focused writing. Get thoughts out of my head and on paper. Practice gratitude. Reinforce my identity and goals. Set my top 5 actions for the day.

6. Stop scrolling, Start Creating. Write a LinkedIn post. Design a feature for your product. Make an IG reel. Produce a track. Create something every day (it will suck for a while but it’s amazing how fast you get better when you practice every day).

___

Starting in 2019, I did all of these for more than a year with basically no “results”. 

It wasn’t until 18 months later when my business took off, I got in top physical shape, my content took off, etc.

Some people will think this is “extreme” or “too much”. It’s not. If you want a top 1% life, you need to take top 1% actions. SIMPLE!

No better time to start than NOW. Let’s get it 💪 💪

The resulting impact:

-Minimum -$100MM per year in lost shareholder value
-Minimum 10% slower revenue growth 
-150%-200% higher New Logo CAC 
-Lower pipeline coverage, quota attainment, and per rep productivity (PRP)

Why is this happening? 

It’s simple: 

Nobody in the entire GTM is truly accountable to a Unit Economics target at the “top of the funnel” 

B2B Companies can’t even measure this metric because they only track expenses by GL code. 

And because they are unable to clearly define and align on the true problem, they instead delegate ownership to fix this to VPs and mid-level managers who apply department-level band-aids that feel good but don’t actually solve the real problem*:

-Change from the MQL waterfall to the Four Funnel Model
-Hire a new marketing agency 
-Hire a RevOps firm to get more data 
-Buy an ABM platform 
-Experiment with an AI SDR 

__

Growing pipeline doesn’t matter if you need to spend $5 to get $1. That mindset never worked but was allowed during the Growth at All Costs Era…..but it will surely get you fired as CEO in 2024 and beyond. 

This problem exists at the intersection of RevOps, Sales, Marketing, and Finance. And will never get solved with the Decentralized Department Silo process and operating model for GTM. 

#finance #b2b #gtm #marketing #leadership 

p.s. Having your CMO accountable to cost / demo request or cost / marketing sourced opportunity is NOT a real solution. This is another easy band-aid that companies try but doesn't fix the real problem. 

*Not properly measuring or assigning accountability to a true Unit Economics target at the top of the funnel is one of many symptoms of the Decentralized Department Silo’s process of aligning, planning, and optimizing GTM.

All the “benchmarks” I’ve seen on LinkedIn this year are misleading and wildly inaccurate.

1. Companies with an ACV less than $4k have an average CAC payback period of 8 months - WRONG.

The average total CAC payback period we measure for ACV less than $4k is more than 36 months including Marketing programs & headcount, Sales, Technology & Tools, SDRs, the “Growth” team, etc.

2. 50% of B2B advertising budgets are spent on LinkedIn - WRONG.

LinkedIn advertising is almost always less than 15% of the total digital advertising spend when you consider Google Ads, Bing ads, content syndication, display advertising, and other social media advertising.

3. Company pages are better on LinkedIn because the CTR is so much higher - WRONG.

Click-through rate is a terrible metric to determine if one thing is “better” than another.

4. “LinkedIn MQLs” convert to opportunities at 37% - WRONG.

LinkedIn MQLs convert to opportunities at less than 3% for effectively every company we analyze. And LinkedIn MQLs convert to customers at less than 0.2% on average. There is large scale data from Metadata that confirms this with 200,000+ MQLs.

5. Companies with an ACV more than $25k have an average CAC payback of 17 months - WRONG.

B2B companies don’t even have a Marketing CAC payback less than 17 months. Add in Sales, SDRs, Growth Team, Tech & Tools, Operations and all of a sudden the average CAC payback for this ACV range is 48+ months.

__

And as I look at all this data and misguided conclusions, all I can think is that I’ve analyzed 50+ B2B companies in the past year (and 250+ companies in the past 5 years) from all types of verticals from SalesTech to HR Tech to FinTech to Cybersecurity SaaS to vertical SaaS and more - getting actual financial data and actual Salesforce data - and none of these “benchmarks” are anywhere close to what’s happening in the real World.

And here’s why to use extreme caution when you see data like this:

1. Most of these benchmarks are created through surveys. People can just answer and guess what their numbers are w/o even pulling actual data.

2. Literally zero companies are measuring and tracking their revenue data in the same way. ZERO. And if the core data isn’t consistent, the benchmarks are wrong too.

3. None of the data is reviewed or validated by a third-party.

4. No common set of terminology, definitions or data standards are used to create benchmarks.

5. Bringing attribution models and other company-specific models, calculations and assumptions make it literally impossible to compare apples to apples between companies.

It’s like running science experiments without any equipment and just pulling numbers out of thin air.

It’s like trying to measure how far a mile is without defining what a mile means.

It’s bad science. Misleading and inaccurate.

So now it’s out there. Beware of the “benchmarks” you see on LinkedIn.

Among the top 500 players in SaaS and AI with transpare,"2025 will be remembered as the year when seemingly everybody lost confidence in their pricing. Among the top 500 players in SaaS and AI with transparent pricing, there were more than 1,800 pricing changes in 2025 alone.

That’s a staggering 3.6 pricing changes per company. Some, like Lovable, made a meaningful pricing change every 👏 single 👏 month in 2025.

I enlisted help from Rob Litterst, co-founder of pricing intelligence platform PricingSaaS, to give readers a tactical rundown of what happened and what (if anything) seems to be working in SaaS pricing.

Here's the TL;DR. Read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eptCbRBz

Trend 1: Credit models exploded in popularity, up 126% YoY

Most credits models fall into one of four buckets based on this 2x2: (a) is it more customer-friendly or vendor-friendly? & (b) are credits cost-based or value-based?

 - AI credits as product feature (see: HubSpot, Adobe)
 - AI credits as a creative sandbox (see: Lovable, Replit)
 - AI credits as enterprise infra (see: Figma, Cursor)
 - AI credits as a pass-through utility (see: Clay, PostHog)

Trend 2: The great re-bundling of AI

The more credit models flood the marketplace, the more customers will want to return to simplicity. In 2025 the pendulum swung toward credits. In 2026 it'll likely swing back toward simplicity and predictability.

Some of the biggest names in SaaS -- including Notion, Slack & Loom -- launched their first AI product as an add-on, and have since bundled that functionality into their core pricing model. Each had charged between $4 to $10 per user for an AI add-on. Now they're bundling AI and raising prices by between $2.50 and $5 per user.

Trend 3: Making seat-based pricing work harder

As companies introduce more complex pricing models, seats look customer-friendly by comparison.

Companies doing this well are layering additional value dimensions on top of the seat. Instead of a seat being just permission to log in, a seat becomes a gateway to more product capability, more automation, more consumption, more outcomes, or more flexibility.

Trend 4: The emergence of choose-your-own-pricing

For the past decade, vendors held most of the leverage: long-term contracts, rigid license models, and extractive pricing practices were staples of the legacy playbook. 

AI breaks that model. The demand for optionality is reshaping how SaaS companies think about pricing.

Here’s why: 

Before 2010, trade show conferences were one of the only ways for B2B buyers to discover new products. 

Your peers and colleagues weren’t telling you about it, especially in B2B. Back then, we didn’t even have the capability to connect and learn from our peers who were also a CFO, or Director of IT, or VP Sales, or any other title. 

You weren’t hearing about new products on social media - most social media channels didn’t exist at that time. 

B2B companies didn’t have websites or put much information about their products on the internet. 

There were almost no other ways to discover new products for your B2B job or specialty than trade conferences. 

So what did a B2B buyer do back then?

-They flew to a B2B conference once or twice a year. 
-They went to sessions to learn, and maybe picked up some continuing education credits. 
-They carefully perused every booth on the tradeshow floor and learned what products were new and available. 
-And then they took all the brochures back to the office and told their colleagues what products were available. 

That is just not how the World works anymore. 

There’s just a million other more cost-effective ways to get your target customer to discover you today than hoping they stumble upon your booth at a tradeshow.

p.s. Having a presence at conferences can be a great idea for having meetings with customers, creating content, executing market research, holding meetings with prospects, and doing general business development. 

But you don't need to spend a boatload of money on a booth to get any of these things done.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chriswalker171_gotomarket-marketing-events-activity-7209193355774160897-ritY?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAt_JwsBA5FQptylIAREHje_475muw58sRI,2024-06-19T14:00:36.352Z

No just kidding. Trying to get a thirsty hook. That was 7-8 years ago and so much has happened since then.

One of the best parts about running Exit Five is that each week I get to chat with a top CMO in B2B, and this week my guest is Maura Rivera from Qualified.

In a world where CMOs are changing jobs every 1-2 years, Maura has been holding it down at Qualified for SIX YEARS. That deserves some type of award, and is worth unpacking (plus she told me something like half of the marketing team has been there that long too, which says a lot).

We talked about:

• Why product launches are the glue for marketing (and why you need to have this cadence of product launches and a tight relationship with the VP Product)

•  What agentic marketing really means for the future of marketing, how is it different than ""marketing"" and why outbound is actually working for them right now (I thought outbound is dead?)

• How events have become a huge part of their strategy. Plus, plenty of good banter along the way. This was a fun one. I want to go hangout with Maura now.

Mostly Growth is the (mostly) serious podcast for anyone who cares about startup growth.

Like a good millennial, I listen to *a lot* of podcasts. But I struggle to find business podcasts that are both insightful and entertaining. Too many are run-of-the-mill interviews with a rotating cast of the same dozen guests repeating their talking points.

The Mostly Growth pod is here to change that. It’s myself, my favorite CFO CJ Gustafson (from Mostly Metrics), and producer Ben Hillman unpacking the most interesting happenings in tech and startups.

A taste of what we jammed on this week:
➡️ Is T2D3 dead?
➡️ SEO's collapse and AEO's rise
➡️ Y-axis crimes of mass proportions (👀 Ramp)
➡️ The brutal job market for new grads
➡️ Hospital bed Linkedin photos
➡️ The story of Bob's Barricades (and his curious pricing model)

You can check it out on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify (links below). Your support would mean the world to us and convince the algorithms we’re legit. 

Hope you enjoy it 🙏🙏

AI compa","What I believe about how to make money from AI:

1. SaaS pricing used to be kinda boring. But the old playbook doesn't work for AI products.

AI companies can't afford to make pricing a 'future me' decision. The best LLMs are still fairly expensive. Token volume is exploding. And the top 10% of your customers might account for 70-80% of your costs!

And AI startups can't copy the big players. Even giants like Salesforce, OpenAI & Cursor are scrambling to adapt pricing models for AI.

2. Buying models are evolving from ""owning"" to ""hiring"". And how you charge impacts how much customers will pay.

Consider how you paid for your last car ride. You might've bought a car (on-prem), leased a car (subscription), rented one (usage-based), called an Uber (outcome-based), or hired a chauffer (service-as-software). The old models don't fully go away. But customers get more options & the market expands.

Each phase unlocked pricing power. We didn't pay less for SaaS; we paid less upfront & more over time if products delivered. 

Success-based pricing models can capture 25%+ of the economic value the products create because a) they take on risk & b) they tap into new budgets.

3. There are more flavors of AI pricing than you think. Study them. 

And avoid flat fees or seat-based pricing unless you have the margins to support them.

4. The big $$ opportunity is value-based pricing. AI credits are a bridge.

Remember MoviePass? They've been resurrected w/ higher prices & a new credit model. AI companies are doing the exact same thing.

Hybrid pricing models -- usually a mix of per-seat pricing + AI credits -- have exploded from 27% to 41% adoption. These are great for now. But your buyer doesn't want to manage 20+ vendors that all sell credits. 

5. Build with pricing agility in mind right now.

Your pricing will need to change. Plan for it. 

What that means: a) someone needs to own it, b) you need a modern tech stack w/ the flexibility to adjust models & c) you need to talk to your customers about pricing & value.

---

The TL;DR: the AI boom will be the AI bust unless we can turn AI products into great AI businesses. Pricing is your path to AI growth.

It kinda nailed it…

A man can survive being poor—he’s done it for ten thousand years—but he cannot survive being unnecessary.

The machine doesn’t hate us, doesn’t love us, doesn’t know we exist, and somehow that indifference is the loneliest outcome imaginable.

What people want is to matter, to be needed by something that knows they are there, and the machine offers efficiency but it does not offer that.

So the hate isn’t really about the technology—it’s about the emptiness the technology reveals, the emptiness that was always there, papered over by busyness and the old lie that usefulness equals worth.

When the usefulness goes, the lie falls apart, and people are left holding pieces of an identity that no longer fits together.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_i-asked-ai-to-tell-me-why-we-hate-ai-generated-activity-7410315985271832576-WEXb?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADw0mRYBSQhH_XZIMc99PusHGtWd6FiGizw,2025-12-26T13:50:07.902Z

Each week you see SDRs taking screenshots of replies from buyers that are like… “this person told me to jump off a cliff”

The invariable response looks like this:
1. Shouldn’t they know how sales works
2. We don’t want to work with people like that
3. Yah what a jerk, he must be disturbed

But this totally misses the point because 100% of the empathy is deployed to THE SELLER.

But sales isn’t about feeling sorry for ourselves, it’s not about us, it’s about the buyer.

If we are triggering our buyers to respond like that, don’t WE have the responsibility to not send messages that trigger such replies?

So here are some ideas to not get yelled at:

1. Copy and paste all your transcripts into Claude and ask, “what secrets did buyers share that are counterintuitive and give me their names and titles, here’s a spreadsheet of the calls I have uploaded to correlate them. Now you can share SECRETS of their peers.

2. Go figure out if they are hiring for roles, and see if you know someone and begin with a few recommendations for people in your network (or at your company) that would be good fits.

3. Go figure out your internal company problems and seek out vendors and explain what’s going on internally to VPs of Sales at companies who could help.

4. Go figure out if they are going to a conference and scraoe the attendees list or exhibitor list for them.

5. Want to be BALLER, go figure out who has spoke recently at conferences and send the speakers customized gifts on behalf of the conference. The go to the conference folks and share with them what you did and let them take credit.

6. Do the play above, but for recent case studies. Here’s your intro email “Jordan, I read your case study with bob at frolic construction. I did some research on bob and he loves racing so I’d like to send him a day at the track, paid for by my company, but on your behalf to thank him for his case study. His address is X from what I can tell. You want me to add a custom handwritten note? I have a budget to spend anyways, and might as well do something nice for you instead of cold pitch.”

People are just TIRED of TAKING and SAMENESS.

If you just don’t take, and try to give, and you’re like 15% weirder than everyone else… novelty plus kindness WILDLY pays off.

The only reason I haven’t had to do outbound for my business in a long time is I try to put this type of energy out into the universe.

It pays back at such a dividend that I never need to force my business to grow, it grows on its own, even when my business model is designed for 100% churn.

So stop posting mean replies, earn amazing replies, and recognize that the locus of control is on you.

You’re the only one that can plant the seeds to change your circumstance. To get upset with our buyers is to invite laziness into your thoughts, to invite a mindset of failure.

Go make exceptional experiences for your buyers and you’ll want for nothing.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_hot-take-sdrs-deserve-the-heated-replies-activity-7400592010841120768-A1cY?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEbZhlwBWvfv4eRw30Gb6YfF6H6xNv9ohdk,2025-11-29T17:50:31.735Z

1️⃣ Fewer management layers of *people*

Even senior hires are player-coaches who do their share of IC work.

2️⃣ More management layers of *AI agents*

Each team member will have their own ""org chart"" consisting of a mix of AI agents, contractors, advisors and (maybe) full-time hires. 

3️⃣ Hiring fewer, but high agency people

There's a premium on former founders or folks w/ side hustles -- people who are used to tackling unfamiliar challenges. These folks all need to be 'high context' so they can make decisions independently. 

4️⃣ Generalists over specialists

A marketer might own content & paid. Or community & partnerships. Or product launches & demand gen. A GTM hire might look more like a 'GTM engineer' doing a mix of pipeline generation, RevOps and growth.

5️⃣ Premium on product, domain and/or technical knowledge 

The rationale: these skills allow folks to a) deeply understand users, b) build community & content that resonates, c) automate what they're doing so they can take on more. 

This is coming even to GTM roles where it didn't used to matter.

1. CIOs now *prefer* usage-based models. 

So much for usage-based pricing being seen as a barrier to adoption 🤷‍♂️

My two cents: most AI spend w/ the CIO is on LLMs and compute. Both are usage-based categories where folks have become accustomed to granular pricing and not buying shelfware. 

With usage-based models, there’s also a connotation that prices will come down over time as vendors compete. Avoid picking a pricing metric that positions your app as a commodity w/o differentiation!

2. Seat-based models aren’t the key to unlocking budget. 

Only 21% said seat-based pricing was their preferred model. That’s slightly less than hybrid models (23%) even though hybrid models are inherently more complicated with more risk of overages/extra fees.

My two cents: buying in a way that reflects the value received is >>> than having perfect budget certainty/predictability. And flexibility matters as folks are finding which AI apps are “experiments” vs ready for “production”. 

3. There’s a lot of work to educate CIOs about how to pay for outcomes.

15% said outcome-based models are their preferred way to buy — although that’s still significant considering only *5% of companies* have outcome-based pricing today (based on the 2025 State of B2B Monetization report)! We’re still in the early innings. 

Among the concerns CIOs raised: (1) lack of clear, measurable outcomes for most products - 47%, (2) unpredictable or unscalabe costs - 36%, (3) difficulty with attribution to a specific tool - 25%. 

My two cents: I suspect line of business is much more open to outcome-based pricing than the CIO — after all, the CRO and the CMO are measured based on outcomes, too! But if you’re thinking about outcome-based pricing, you need outcome consistency, attribution, measurability and predictability (CAMP).

But it turns out it’s not as popular as it seems.

GTM engineers are meant to bring technology and automation to solve hard GTM problems (of which there are many!). I think of GTM engineers as people who can both identify friction points across the buying journey (ICP targeting, ICP pipeline, conversion, CAC, etc.) and then quickly run automated, 1:many experiments to eliminate them.

It’s essentially a growth hire, but focused on a primarily sales-led or sales-assisted funnel rather than a product-led one.

Despite the buzz, I haven’t met many actual GTM engineers yet. There really aren’t a lot of software companies hiring for GTM engineers, either.

Here's what the data shows (see it for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/ezfJ_JJf)

1. There were 128 GTM Engineer jobs posted in the last 3 months. 

Sounds like a lot, but that's 1 for every 14 in RevOps. 1 for every 35 in SalesOps. And 1 for every 92 SDRs (!) -- which nobody is calling a hot job.

2. 45% of those with a GTM engineer title are actually agencies or consultants (shoutout to Amos Bar-Joseph). 

3. The role’s popularity is a far cry from other AI-native jobs like AI engineers, prompt engineers or automation engineers. In fact, it barely registers in Google Trends.

---

Before hiring a GTM engineer, I’d suggest you:

 - Start with an agency or consultant to prove value with a specific use case
 - Redeploy someone internally who has the business context paired with the system knowledge
 - Upskill the existing GTM team and equip them with next-gen tooling
 - Hire a great Head of RevOps (or RevTech) and fully resource their team

Don't miss the full story in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/ezfJ_JJf

Then, let me know what you think. Is GTM engineering online hype or is it still the next hot job?

Because apparently doing marketing for products like:

I am always a little bit saddened when I see these consolidation plays at SUPER early stage startups, because they are launching new technology with old world thinking... 

Old World Thinking:
1. Build 1 tool to take over 10 (that means competing against 10 tools).
2. Build a HUGE THING before you've sold much of anything.
3. Build a BUNCH of product surface area where you can't be the best in the world at any of it.
4. Make no compromises to achieve greatness. 
5. Thinking that volume eclipses value for a particular customer. 

That one complex thing can do it all for all horizontal SaaS companies... and my guess is with $80M in funding they have less than $1M in ARR so there's just SO MUCH surface area built of total total guesswork and it's increasing, too.

Ironically, these GTM companies usually have the hardest time going to market because they really are designed to make for impossible sales. If it really worked, they would be able to turn it on and it would have printed customers.

Here's what their sale looks like:

1. Replace all your current GTM tech (for MM companies) OR install this HUGE 
bloated thing when you have nothing (for seed stage companies with no PMF)
2. Take a GIGANTIC bet on this one system.
3. We do so much, so any ONE thing likely isn't going to be great.

And reading articles that say things like...

""Since its inception, Reevo has bolstered its team to 90 employees, anchored by senior engineers and proven leaders from Affirm, Airbnb, Box, DoorDash, HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, Square, Rippling, and Uber.""

^--- All vanity metrics and what does Airbnb know about B2B SaaS GTM?

If you're spending money on slick ass videos, it means you haven't changed people's lives. That should be our metric.

Congrats to this team, and I'm really sad to say, I think this won't go anywhere given how hard the product team has worked to make the GTM's team live miserable and awful.

If I'm wrong, I'm looking forward to being embarrassed on a huge billboard in 2030. But, I wouldn't bet against me.

If we’re ever going to find out what works, we need a unified (and account-based) view of go-to-market effectiveness.

It starts with figuring out *exactly* where you stand with your target accounts in real-time. What this means:

1️⃣ You know exactly how many accounts are in your ICP.

2️⃣ You've *identified* the buyers at those accounts and can market to them. 

This is easier than ever with next-gen GTM tooling.

3️⃣ You know how many are *aware* of you. 

They're consistently opening your emails, engaging with your ads, visiting your website, etc.

4️⃣ You know how many are *interested*. 

These prospects are self-educating through interactive demos, signing up for a free account, attending a webinar, or viewing high-intent website pages. (Ideally these become high-intent leads for warm outbound.)

5️⃣ You know how many are *considering* a purchase. 

You can think of these are SQLs within your ICP, but they could be PQLs or self-service team buyers as well.

6️⃣ You know how many are *selecting* a vendor, meaning they're engaging in a buying process. 

This typically translates to proposal stage.

7️⃣ You know how many have chosen your product, becoming a customer. (Of course, you can extend this framework post-purchase, too!)

---

If you look at GTM effectiveness this way, it doesn't matter whether you invest more in AEO, PLG, automated outbound, SEO, paid ads, BDRs/SDRs, memes, or something else entirely.

What matters is that you ultimately reach the right people and turn them into customers.

","We’ve run our Revenue Diagnostics process on more than 40 of the leading SaaS companies in the last 180 days and here is the craziest finding of all:

High-Performing Marketing teams deliver 10X more net new revenue with the same budget than Low Performers. (yes, you read that right). 

Here’s how it breaks down:

Low Performers: $0.27 - $0.40 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. This equates to a 30-42 month CAC payback on just the Marketing expenditures (add in Sales, Ops, SDRs, etc.) and you are at 48-60+ months in total CAC payback period. 

Median: $0.89 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. This equates to a 14-month Marketing CAC payback period. 

High Performers: $2.55 - $3.10 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. This equates to about a 4-month Marketing CAC payback period. 

___

Here are some of the patterns we see that set the high performers from the rest:

MARKET. This one is difficult to control but seems to be a top contributing factor. High performers sell products that are a need to have, not a nice to have. For instance, Cybersecurity companies typically fall on the high performing spectrum. Companies in HR Tech, MarTech, etc. may fall on the lower on the spectrum as their products could be considered “nice to have” in this market. 

THOUGHT LEADERSHIP. High performers have a well-oiled machine of effective thought leadership content marketing that they’ve invested time and money into for a long period of time. 

GTM MOTION(S). Companies with a dual PLG - Enterprise Sales motion tend to have lower Marketing ROI. I have not identified the root cause as to why yet. It could be that dual-motion companies spend more on Marketing as a % of overall GTM budget. Or it could be that they are over-invested in digital performance marketing to get lots of low value SMB customers through the PLG motion. Or something else. I will continue to investigate and report back, but this is definitely an initial clear pattern. 

ACV ($). Not fully validated yet, but there seems to be a correlation that companies that command higher and stable ACVs deliver overall stronger marketing ROI.

To the point w","Marketing measurement has become wildly overcomplicated and it’s the most expensive, painful business problem in a B2B company today. 

To the point where nobody can even understand what’s going on.

And it’s only getting worse.

If you ask 5 people in your company to answer a critical business question, you’ll get 5 different sets of reports, built on 5 different sets of data, with 5 different conclusions.

These responsibilities get delegated down to a mid-level RevOps or Marketing employee, but none of the people building the reports, analyzing the data, or drawing the conclusions have access to the full financial data, or the experience & financial acumen to do this properly.

The Finance team wants to help and drive the GTM to operate efficiently and within financial guardrails so they can deliver for the board and shareholders, but they lack the GTM expertise to weigh in on what needs to change. 

Everyone is searching for a quick fix. Let’s slap a new attribution tool or mix-modeling tool on top of our messy, incomplete, inaccurate CRM data architecture. 

Then we can hook it up with our Power BI dashboard, do a bunch of offline data manipulation to try to reconstruct our shitty CRM data into something usable.

Now they want to add PhD level statistics on top of incomplete, inaccurate touchpoint and impression data and think that’s gonna solve it lol. 

Everyone is making this WAY more complicated than it needs to be. 

So, while everyone else goes more and more complicated to a level that nobody on the Exec Team or Board can understand….the real solution is to SIMPLIFY:

1. When you properly frame the problem, you’ll realize there’s no single technology tool or silver bullet to fix this problem.

And fixing the biggest problem in your entire company that’s costing shareholders $50MM+/quarter *should* be hard. There are multiple layers to the problem. And your RevOps team isn’t going to fix it (sorry not sorry).

2. Most everyone delegates the problem to mid-level employees that operate within their department silo’s. 

This is a FINANCE problem that intersects with GTM and requires deep GTM expertise. Offloading it to your RevOps team is a losing strategy. Offloading it to your Marketing Director - also a losing strategy.

3. Solving it within department silo’s forces bottoms up tactical solutions that don’t layer up to C-Level insights & strategy and Board-Level clarity & confidence. 

The real way to solve this is tops-down. Which requires C-Level executives to OWN the problem. Which feels super logical considering it’s the most painful, expensive problem in a B2B company today.

4. Everyone is overcomplicating it with a million touchpoints & PhD level statistics when the real solution is to SIMPLIFY.

-You can try to have a Pipeline meeting on Wednesdays

Which *forces* Marketing alignment to business results. Dramatically shifts the reporting and analytics. And drives positive changes to investment allocation and strategy almost immediately.

Measuring Marketing impact with zero targets or controls against Unit Economics needs to stop. 

Want to get dramatically better results (Growth Rate + ROI) from your Marketing team next year? 

Make your CMO accountable *actual business results* instead of “Marketing Sourced” or “Marketing Influenced” or “Leads” where Marketing can hit their goals every quarter and the Sales team misses quota and the company misses growth targets. 

It should be *impossible* for this to happen if you have proper business-level Marketing KPIs. 

If this happens in your company, it’s clearly obvious that the Marketing KPIs need to change.

Just do whatever you’re doing, and before you ship to the customer, read what you wrote.

Thing 2:

Just ask a customer about their research, their options, what mattered to them, why, what they didn’t consider. Inhabit their worldview.

You can’t own framing the problem if you’re clueless about their world, and you can’t know where you best fit in if you don’t know where other tools best you.

The art comes in talking about HOW you do what you do NOT outcomes. You need to have a POV that makes what you do compelling.

What 40+ of the best AI-native companies are doing:

I enlisted Yaakov Carno to map out AI prompt journeys across products like Canva, Notion, Vercel, Lovable, Airtable (& lesser known AI companies). He traced every step from homepage to first value. 

The 7 most interesting observations ⤵️

1. Consider offering multiple entry points: the prompt bar OR a visual UX. 

Gamma and Wix are two 🔥 examples. Gamma even has 3 options.

2. Increase relevance with a ""hidden"" step between the prompt bar & output. 

Lovable, for example, has a series of onboarding questions to collect more context.

3. Don’t just tell users they can “generate anything.” Show them specific, meaningful examples that connect to their job-to-be-done. 

Canva, for instance, has a visual use case selector w/ a category & sub-category.

4. Use the prompt bar to educate users about what kind of tasks your product supports. 

Zapier there are sample prompts for lead management, customer support, marketing & growth, and project mgmt.

5. Distinguish whether the AI is a copilot or autopilot. 

Notion nails this with a mix of placeholder text, surrounding CTAs, and examples that clearly convey what you can do and why.

6. Integrate context, data, and sources at the beginning.

bolt.new has a new minimalistic design that focuses only on importing from Figma and GitHub. Constraints increase the likelihood of relevant, valuable outputs.

7. Add a fun factor to make the experience feel different & maybe a bit magical.

Playfulness can lower hesitation. Riff and Leap use “Shuffle” or “Surprise me” icons to encourage exploration.

12. AirHelp (35% success fee)
13. SmarterDx (only gets paid when hospitals make $$ incrementally)

The interest in outcome-based pricing models is unlike anything I’ve seen. 

Look, I love outcome-based pricing -- in theory. It feels like the ultimate win-win. Will we get there? There's a (big) elephant in the room, which I’m calling the CAMP framework. 

To pull off outcome-based pricing, you need four things:
- Consistency of outcomes across customer types
- Attribution for those outcomes
- Measurability, ideally in real-time
- Predictability of outcomes

Without CAMP, outcome-based pricing is just hype. I'll be following along to see how the first-movers navigate this 👀

Breaking News

Exit Five Founder & CEO Dave Gerhardt hits the injured list for the next 8-12 weeks after successful surgery to fix femoroacetabular impingement and labral tear in his right hip.

Despite the pain he is currently in, Gerhardt - an eternal optimist - remains positive given the extreme privilege of his situation.

""My job requires sending Slack messages, posting on LinkedIn, and taking phone calls. I'm very lucky. I will get through this and I'm looking forward to the mental challenge of recovery.""

In an interview with Forbes, Gerhardt also comment that he would have been ""absolutely fucked"" if he stuck to his ways as a solopreneur. 

Now with a full-time team of 7 people working on Exit Five, Gerhardt will be able to recover in peace while his business continues to grow and he can stick to writing witty comments on LinkedIn and giving feedback in Slack over the next few months.

""Before you know it, I will be back running, lifting, rucking, cross country skiing, and doing all the necessary things I need to do to calm my inner thoughts and demons, but for now this is mostly going to be a battle of me vs. myself.""

Please do not send any flowers or edible arrangements. 

Instead, tell as many people that work in marketing as possible about the amazing company that is known as Exit Five and make sure to join the email list on the website.

Note: I don't want your sympathy, I am fine and very lucky. I just knew this is the perfect type of thing to post on LinkedIn and it will help grow our business.

We will 100% turn this into a Thought Leader ad too.

PS. Who is more charming - Real Dave or AI Dave?

Maja and I surveyed 195 B2B leaders about which GTM channels are working right now. We then mapped how popular different GTM channels are (x-axis) versus how likely they are to be impactful among adopters (y-axis).

The shorthand for interpreting this two-by-two:
1. Tried-and-true (upper right)
2. Oversaturated (lower right)
3. The next big thing (upper left)
4. Figuring it out (lower left)

I then cut the data for startups (<$10M ARR) vs. scaleups (>$10M ARR) & it's fascinating to see how the channels shift.

The best channels for startups*:
 - LinkedIn (#1)
 - Founder brand (#2)
 - Warm outbound (#3)
 - Intent-based outbound (#4)
 - Intimate events (#5)

*The magic tends to happen when you can combine these channels into a cohesive strategy, i.e. founder brand + LinkedIn + warm outbound & intimate events for those who engage.

The best channels for scaleups*:
 - Large conferences (#1)
 - SEO (#2)
 - Intimate events (#3)
 - Big product launches (#4)
 - Ecosystem marketing (#5)

*Scaleups are still seeing returns from their years of SEO investments. The question is whether they can translate their SEO into AI discovery or if they'll be leap-frogged by new entrants.

The TL;DR: No matter what stage you're at, you might want to plan for more intimate events (dinners, happy hours, etc.) next year. They're not the most scalable, but they're one of the few things that seems to work.

274,Chris Walker,0,345,67,13,425,504.2,0.68,"Just so you know, hiring a new marketing agency isn’t going to fix your GTM problem.

All you’re doing is changing the pit crew for your race car. Sure they may change the wheels better (and that’s a good thing), but it’s not going to be why you win the race. And it's not going to help much if your race car sucks.

And here’s the key insight: Even though many resources to fix this problem come from Marketing, the Marketing department can’t fix this on their own. 

This is truly a GTM problem, not a Marketing problem. And the only people who can truly solve this are the CEO and CFO. 

Because the GTM planning model, governed by finance and monitored by the board, is likely the reason your Marketing is under-delivering in the first place. 

It’s not due to lack of talent, technology, or resources.

It’s because our GTM planning and attribution model drives all of the wrong behaviors with our $15MM per year on Marketing and SDRs. And totally fails to give us proper insights to build a confident go-forward plan to accelerate growth.

There are only 2 things that happen when you change your marketing agency in hopes they come and save the day, but fail to change the KPIs that determine success of Marketing overall and the agency:

1. The Marketing agency succumbs to your outdated attribution model and runs ineffective campaigns because they appease your attribution model. In 6 months, you see no “results” and give up. You waste 6 months and a lot of money and go nowhere.

2. The Marketing agency runs their more effective Marketing strategies aligned to business results, but since you didn’t change your planning and attribution models, at the exec level, it looks like the agency isn’t working. After 6 months, you unknowingly cut bait on a strategy that’s working because you measure the wrong things to determine success.

No wonder companies change marketing agencies every 12 months.....and then they blame the problem on the agency or fire the CMO.

When a Marketing agency fails, it’s YOUR FAULT. It’s your fault for not setting them up for success, aligning their activities to growth rate and ROI, and setting clear guardrails around performance.

In fact, it doesn’t matter who runs your demand gen program - whether it’s an agency or an in-house team.

If the CEO and CFO don’t change their GTM planning and attribution modeling, you’re very unlikely to see a tangible impact on business results just by changing internal or external talent for campaign execution.

I imagine this isn’t a “popular opinion” but don’t shoot the messenger. I’m just here telling you what you need to hear instead of what you want to hear 🙂 

Nothing changes if nothing changes. CEOs, CFOs, and Boards need to fix the real problem.

And growth has since *exploded* — from $1 to $17M ARR in the last 8 months.

Some quick stats on Fyxer AI:
👉 Founded & run by two brothers, Archie and Richard.
👉 Raised a $10M Series A led by Harry at 20VC with backing from Marc Benioff & Lenny. Then raised a $30M Series B led by Madrona only 6 months later.
👉 This is real ARR -- 90% of paying users stick around >3 months & net revenue retention (NRR) is 150%+ in most cohorts (🤯).

Today's Growth Unhinged unpacks how they did it. Read the story here: https://lnkd.in/ejF7Vxte

Fyxer's consumer to enterprise AI expansion playbook in 5 steps:

Step 1: Make the product dead simple for everyday people.

The onboarding process feels almost non-existent; once you’ve integrated your calendar, it's essentially ready to go. 

There are no complicated shortcuts. But you can easily adapt it to your preferences by toggling a slider or adding a few extra sentences to the style prompt.

Step 2: Turn to influencers to get initial traction.

From zero to $1M ARR, Fyxer’s biggest growth lever was definitively non-sexy. It was Archie sliding into DMs and begging people to post on LinkedIn. 

Each influencer post attracted about 20-30 new signups. (Btw, there wasn’t much correlation between an influencer’s size and their impact.)

Step 3: Go big with consumer performance marketing.

Performance marketing now drives about half of Fyxer’s new growth. 

Their ad cadence is relentless. Two-week sprints, 200+ ads live at any given moment, 100-150 new creative variations every sprint. This is powered by (lots) of AI tools incl. ChatGPT, Claude, ReelFarm, Arcads AI, ElevenLabs, HeyGen, Synthesia, Motion & Getdot.ai. 

Step 4: Refine GTM around business users and enterprise expansion.

Work email signups are worth 10x more than personal emails. The top KPI for performance marketing: cost-per-work-email.

Step 5: Continuously improve AI and reactivate users along the way.

One of the biggest reasons why initial Fyxer signups didn’t convert was that the AI wasn’t quite good enough yet. The next unlock is re-activating these users. They're doing it with trial re-starts & a human-seeming email “from” a founder (Archie in particular).

Hope you find this useful 🙏

The whole purpose of a compliment is that it’s from the heart, genuine. 

Also, the whole purpose of automation for sales is to open up conversations.

But how you begin impacts where and if you get to end. 

This is why I have only two frameworks for messaging:

PQS
PVP

A PQS is a pain qualified segment and it simply means that the list is the message, 

“Jordan given that you post everyday and comment on 10 posts or so a day, you spend a ton of time on LinkedIn, no? If you could be shown only Vertical SaaS CROs and CEOs in your feed—would that likely mark your comments more powerful?”

The list you’d build in this case is active commenters on linkedin who are engaging a lot with non-ICP accounts (if this was a product—like customized LinkedIn feed).

A PVP is a message SO GOOD you’d pay to received it. Permissionless Value Prop. Here’s what that would look like…

“Jordan, given your activity on LinkedIn, and that only 10% of your last 100 comments were on vSaaS brands—I thought I’d give you a list of 500 CROs and CEOs of vSaaS B2B brands that posted on linkedin 20+ times in the last month, and here’s a ChatGPT prompt to have Atlas auto-follow each one.”

This is a message that carries independent value to me.

Nothing about fake compliments or ball fluffery, just pure hard value.

Neither will a pipeline meeting on Wednesdays. 

Neither will a CMO-CRO bi-weekly coffee meeting. 

Neither will firing your CMO and trying to hire a unicorn marketing leader.

It might make it easier for people to work together. 

It might patch up the problem for a while that will come back to you in 3 months when you’re missing your pipeline for Q4. 

It’s a Band-Aid. 

The real solution? 

Redesign your GTM (aka the Factory that produces your revenue) - Starting with Financial Planning, Modeling, and Budgeting, and then working across the rest of GTM team to Sales, Marketing, Sales Dev, Ops, Post-Sale, etc. 

1. Build a Unified View of GTM with Financial Data & GTM Data that measures both performance (effectiveness) and unit economics (efficiency)

2. Align the entire GTM leadership team on a core KPI stack that has *nothing* to do with attribution by department or channel 

3. Categorize and evaluate GTM investment portfolio allocation by customer lifecycle stage, NOT DEPARTMENT. 

4. Methodically break down compound metrics to isolate the biggest issues / risks / opportunities by customer lifecycle stage

5. Build and align on cross-functional initiatives to solve the biggest issues in your Revenue Factory 

6. Monitor and evaluate impact against the core KPI stack that has nothing to do with attribution by department or channel.

Just like using a hammer (the tool) to pour concrete (the process) doesn’t make sense.

You wouldn’t blame the hammer. You wouldn’t try to switch from a hammer to a mallet. You’d fix the process and use different tools. 

The *PROCESS* is the real problem. But I watch almost every B2B company try to fix it by changing the *TOOL*. 

What a miss. Which results in:

-Massive GTM Team Misalignment

-Marketing / SDR / Partner teams fighting over credit based on whatever attribution model you choose 

-Lack of data visibility to make confident decisions around how to scale Marketing and SDR investments 

-Finance’s over-simplistic ROI calculations by department and channel provide zero strategic insights for what to do next

-Most GTM leaders default to spending more money, hiring more reps, requesting more budget. Rather than getting more efficient 

-RevOps wasting months debating whether they should switch from a first touch to a linear model & making no changes

-Sales starving at the bottom of the funnel, so they need to do low-quality prospecting which increases CAC & kills scalability 

-CFO feels like Marketing & SDRs aren’t working, but doesn’t know how to drill into CRM data to confirm & figure out what to do next

What a mess. 

And meanwhile, it costs shareholders and investors more than $50MM every quarter that it doesn’t get fixed. And delays the time horizon for the compounding power of a SaaS businesses. 

It’s one of the most painful, expensive problems in the entire B2B industry today. 

How to fix it:

1. Adopt a shared “First Team” Department-Agnostic set of GTM KPIs 

2. Create a new structure and taxonomy for how you tag, track, and evaluate all GTM investments that is smarter and more sophisticated than which department spent the money. 

3. Fix your CRM architecture so you actually have visibility and tracking of KPIs (not touchpoints!!) across the entire pipeline process so you can proper invest, optimize, and scale investments to Create Pipeline 

4. Build Revenue Factory instrumentation that uses touchpoint data and other forms of statistics in a variety of views to answer key specific questions

5. CFO oversees and optimizes the entire GTM investment portfolio and strategic roadmap to get the best short-term and long-term ROI. 

Your Pipeline Problem is the most expensive problem in your entire company. 

Stop trying to change the tool and instead fix the process!! And when you do, you add hundreds of millions of dollars to your company's value and build a true path to scalability and IPO.

And Finance is the department who’s going to solve it. 

This key performance indicator encompasses Growth Rate and Unit Economics - the two biggest drivers of increasing enterprise value in a B2B company today. 

The problem is that departments inside a GTM engine try to calculate these numbers individually to “prove the ROI” of their department-level investments without consideration or visibility into the top-level financial metrics. 

The Marketing Department calculates “Advertising CAC” and takes the digital advertising spend and divides it by website-sourced revenue and calculates a 9-Month Advertising CAC payback period. 

The Demand Gen team celebrates for hitting their goal. 

The SDR team calculates “cost per meeting booked” and takes all the meetings booked and divides it by the number of SDRs and calculates a $2,000 cost per meeting booked.

The SDR team celebrates booking meetings at what seems to be an acceptable efficiency. 

What these calculations miss is all of the additional costs outside of their department that are required to acquire this revenue:

-9 additional months in other Marketing programs (AR / PR / Events / Content / etc.)
-9 additional months in Marketing headcount
-9 additional months in SDR headcount
-18 additional months in Sales expenses (AE, SE, etc.)
-9 additional months in Operations, Tech, Admin, Tools 

And all of a sudden, the Demand Gen team is celebrating a 9-month advertising CAC payback period while the CFO is calculating a total CAC payback period of 56 months. 

Department silo’s look vertically and measure the cost of their small part of the process.

Go-To-Market leaders look horizontally across the entire customer journey to understand the full cost of acquiring, retaining, and expanding an account. 

The CEO and CFO are the only two executives with the view of the entire go-to-market performance. 

They are responsible for deploying a portfolio of investments (Marketing, Sales, SDRs, Operations, Enablement, Tech/Tools, Admin, etc.) to get an appropriate ROI of incremental ARR.

GTM Efficiency = [ Total GTM Spend / Total Net New ARR ] x 100%

Simply put, GTM Efficiency of 100% means it takes $1 in GTM costs to acquire $1 in incremental ARR.

This blanket statement s","“Our Marketing Investments have a time lag”. Partially true. And simultaneously incredibly misleading. Let’s break it down 👇

This blanket statement shouldn't be a blanket statement. And this mindset leaves tons of CFOs confused, leads to CMOs fired every 18 months, and degrades company KPIs & performance.

1. *Some* “Marketing” Investments, when executed properly, have a time lag. 

First, “Marketing” is a terrible category for investments that include short-term and long-term, strategic and tactical - massively competing objectives. 

For the past 6 years, I've personally executed Demand Creation programs that have a time lag to results: Non-Conversion-Based organic social media, podcasts, live events, influencer collaborations, etc. I understand these programs deeply & have driven $50MM+ in revenue for my own businesses through them.

*Some* Marketing investments have a time lag. Yet go to any B2B SaaS company IRL & almost none of the investments fall into these categories.

2. Most B2B Marketing programs are the same as 4-8 quarters ago. Meaning the “time lag” has already passed.

It’s different if you’re $500k ARR & just getting off the ground. But B2B Marketing strategies & investments for a $100MM company are the same as they were 2+ years ago. The time lag has passed & results (ROI) are still going down. Have you waited long enough yet?

3. A majority (up to 90%) of B2B “Marketing” investments are spent on short-term activities. You can use leading indicator KPIs so you don’t need to wait a year to know if the investments will pay off.

Up to 90% of “Marketing” investments are Performance Marketing objectives and measured against leads, meetings, and pipeline. That’s the goal. 

So if you make an investment and then don’t get a meeting…..that means you also won’t get pipeline. And also won’t get revenue. You don’t need to wait 6-12 months for the “time lag” to know it’s ineffective. 

4. Tons of “Marketing” investments are totally useless. The time lag theory confuses people into thinking if they just wait 12 months, the investments will start “working” when they never will. 

-What’s the time lag of a display ad that loads on the page but never gets seen?

-What’s the time lag of a tradeshow booth that 99% of attendees never see?

-What’s the time lag of a $12 CPC Google Ads that a bot clicks on and bounces immediately?

-What’s the time lag of a cold call that doesn’t get answered?

-What’s the time lag of an e-book that gets downloaded and never opened or read?

-What’s the time lag of an email that gets opened just so the recipient can click unsubscribe?

_

Just because you can track something doesn’t mean it’s valuable. Or that results will eventually come if you just wait long enough.

Would you rather learn how to build a rocket from Elon Musk or a physics professor who teaches theory but has never done it before?

There's a big difference between reciting knowledge from a 1980s textbook and mastering the craft in real life.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chriswalker171_our-marketing-investments-have-a-time-lag-activity-7289663447699443712-xGip?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFWDm3kB0Cw_ACze-UU9cNgypS7p65Ff-lw,2025-01-27T15:20:01.329Z
288,Chris Walker,0,336,47,9,392,504.2,0.67,"Bottoms-Up vs. Tops-Down GTM Analytics

Let’s break down the differences 👇

Bottoms Up GTM Analytics: Data and reporting is generated & analyzed from ","Bottoms-Up vs. Tops-Down GTM Analytics

Let’s break down the differences 👇

Bottoms Up GTM Analytics: Data and reporting is generated & analyzed from each budget holder then assembled into a department-level deck then again assembled into one large GTM report.

Most B2B companies primarily use this approach and it’s clear it has significant drawbacks when used in isolation:

-Every report uses different data & properties
-Conflicting findings across teams & departments
-Way too tactical & complicated for executives to understand & make decisions
-Core objective is to prove/justify how well everything is performing
-Looks like every investment is working

And this bottoms-up reporting philosophy leads to:

- Focus on micro-optimizations and tactical changes
- Loses sight of the bigger picture
- Decisions that should be fast & easy become slow & hard
- Indecision / Inaction
- Misalignment across the GTM teams around what to do next

To solve this, B2B executives should run a Tops-Down Analytics process in parallel to the bottoms-up.

Tops-Down GTM Analytics: Data and reporting starts with *business metrics* and systematically works down to departments and budget holders, leveraging a standardized and consistent reporting structure across the entire GTM.

The Tops-Down GTM Analytics process:

-Starts with the most critical business metrics - growth rate, NRR, GRR, S&M % of Net New ARR, etc
-The top level business performance metrics set the context for why we’re analyzing the lower-level data
-Leverages standardizes data & fields across the entire GTM
-Breaks down the department-level silo’s and uses a holistic view of performance & investments across the entire GTM
-Analyzes and reports at the right altitude so all executives (CEO, CFO, CMO, CRO, etc.) can all understand
-The objective is to fuel *DECISION MAKING*. Not to prove or justify. 
-Puts objective scrutiny on each investment. A lot more frequently we need to be asking the question “what isn’t working” instead of trying to prove everything is working.

This tops-down analytics philosophy leads to:

-Strategic & transformational changes
-Fast & aligned decision making
-Fast, clear identification of low ROI investments
-Focused on the bigger picture

Most B2B companies are stuck. And this is the root cause. Midmarket and Enterprise SaaS companies have well-constructed strategies, esteemed investors, strong products, and brilliant people. What they are missing is the core data foundation and analytics engine across their holistic go-to-market motions and investments.

Running these two processes in parallel ensures B2B executives have the right data to quickly flag and diagnose important issues, identify major opportunities, get cross-functional alignment, and forecast & plan with confidence. While still ensuring that the departments and teams have the process and autonomy to advance micro optimizations and tactical changes.

It’s not an either or, it’s both.

Because almost all marketing today is shaped online.

And online marketing shows up as:

- Ads
- Videos
- Articles
- Podcasts and clips like this with Jess Cook
- Social posts
- Newsletters
- Communities
- Influencers

Different formats. But none of it works without a clear content strategy and strong content marketing.

Jess is a great example of this: she started her career as a copywriter for big CPG brands. She cut her teeth writing 200+ variations of a recipe for Rice Krispie Treats.

Then built a career in content marketing: content market manager, director, VP brand and content.

Then turned that into a Head of Marketing role at a startup and was recently promoted to VP on the heels of her success using - wait for it - content to drive revenue.

Not because Vector's content gets a lot of impressions and their podcast is unique or because their little mascot is cute.

But because it's working! Those things are driving revenue. 

I had a conversation with Jess last week (now out on my podcast) and she shared three key marketing plays that she's run over the past year:

1. Influencer Marketing - how does it work in B2B, how did she find influencers, what did it cost, how much pipeline was generated, how did they measure it

2. Podcasting - why they started a podcast, how their podcast stands out, how they record, when/where, how they prep, how they know it's working

3. LinkedIn - we talk a bit about what content types (and strategy) is working well here today

4. Career Path - her path from content to VP Marketing

It'll be harder & harder to differentiate on the *user* experience. We're going to need to differentiate on the *agent* experience instead.

What I'm seeing from the best products:

1. Product education starts *before* even hitting the website.

With a prompt box UX, the user needs to come to the product already armed with an idea about how to use it. 

Folks are educating users through hackathons, communities, slick launch videos & asking influencers to show off what they've built. Template libraries still work, too. (Half of Lovable's homepage is now devoted to UGC templates.)

2. The product helps you improve your prompt.

Most of us (myself included) aren't prompt engineers. And a garbage prompt can often mean a garbage result -- and not much patience to keep going.

The best products help us clarify our ideas, turning ""meh"" prompts into ""omg"" prompts. I particularly love the one-click ""enhance prompt"" feature in products like bolt.new and Replit.

3. The agentic UX isn't one-and-done.

The UX shouldn't just complete the task and move on. The best agentic experiences recommend next steps & help you do them. 

They can also become the best sales rep for the product: proactively encouraging you to upgrade & then suggesting the plan that's best for you. After all, helping was always the best way of selling.

4. The agent isn't a black box.

The best tools include a preview mode & give users the ability to edit what AI produces. 

It's not just a ""do it for me"" experience, it's a ""do it with me"" experience that leads to an outcome people feel great about.

---

The innovation isn't putting a prompt box in the app. It's creating an agentic UX that (finally) feels personal & maybe a bit magical.

Just 3.5% reach $20 million in ARR within ten years of monetizing, worse odds than getting into Harvard. What makes those outliers different ⤵️

I investigated new data from ChartMogul, the SaaS metrics & growth platform where I'm an Analyst-in-Residence. Their dataset covers 6,525 software companies with historical data going back 10+ years.

What I found surprised me. The winners didn’t necessarily *start* better. They *became* better, reinventing their startups from $1M to $20M ARR.

The four key takeaways you need to know:

1. Interestingly, starting metrics at $1M ARR were pretty similar for the companies that made it to $20M & those who stalled out.

The main difference was MoM growth rate. Outliers were growing 16.7% MoM on average; others were growing 8.7%. But even this wasn’t as pronounced as it appears. 

The top quartile of those who *didn't* make it outpaced more than half of the outliers. Clearly, starting momentum isn't the only factor at play.

2. The outliers were meaningfully better at improving their growth metrics compared to everyone else.

Few managed to accelerate growth rates. But the majority got better at everything else including:

 - Average revenue per account: 72% improved by more than 10%
 - Share of MRR on annual plans: 71% improved by more than 10%
 - Gross revenue retention: 51% improved by more than 10%
 - Net revenue retention: 45% improved by more than 10%

3. Outliers raised prices, increasing avg revenue per account by 82% (!) from $1 to $20M. This was 20 pts better than others.

There are many paths to a higher revenue per account. The common denominator is to increase perceived value over time while simultaneously monetizing that extra value.

4. Outliers got better at expanding their customers with NRR increasing by about 10 percentage points. This was 6 pts better than others, which compounds year after year.

A major driver of this is shifting from single product to multi-product, allowing for more surface area to expand customers.

Full deep dive in today’s Growth Unhinged newsletter (with tactical examples of what to do): https://lnkd.in/eWhsq4Rq

Ok, ready for the pricing roast?!?

1. Flat-fee pricing: Don’t expect to make $$

- Small companies get priced out
- Large companies pay too little
- There’s no expansion revenue
- High potential for low/negative margin customers

2. Feature-based: Bundle hell

- Almost everyone defaults to the middle tier
- The plans are arbitrary and confusing
- Everyone wants to pick-and-choose
- New features throw your plans into a tailspin

3. Seat-based: Isn’t that a dinosaur?

- Companies are cutting heads with AI, meaning less seat $$
- The value of AI agents doesn’t scale with buying more seats
- Not all users are the same. Why should they pay the same for a seat?
- Puts a cap on potential $$ of an account

4. Usage-based: TradCFOs hate it

- It’s too hard to forecast
- Not all usage = ROI for the customer
- Customers self-police their usage, hurting long-term growth
- There’s not a clear usage metric that correlates with value

5. Hybrid pricing: I’m gonna need a PhD to figure out how much this costs 

- There’s way too much complexity
- It’s impossible to calculate costs
- Too hard to manage (quoting, billing, UX, etc.)
- Feels like a bait-and-switch

6. Outcome-based: It’s a pipe dream 

- Measuring outcomes feels impossible
- Customers fight over the bill
- Impossible to estimate outcomes upfront
- You don’t get credit for anything beyond one specific outcome

There is no such thing as a perfect pricing model. 

The best you can do is to choose the pricing model that allows you to tell the unique story of what you do, who you’re for, and why you’re better than the alternative. And have a plan to manage the inevitable downsides.

Getting recommended by AI engines is no longer just a weekend side project (*guilty*).

Josh Blyskal from Profound analyzed data from 100,000 prompts to figure out how these AI engines actually work. Here are nine practical takeaways that you could start applying now to improve your AI search visibility:

(Don't miss the full deep dive in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/e2GdwgNN)

1. Decide which prompts you want to own.

2. Be aware that answer engines behave differently. ChatGPT & Perplexity share only 11% of domain citations. 

3. Write specialized, specific content. 

4. Create surround sound around your product. The best starting points are UGC & social media sites like Reddit, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Quora.

5. Get mentioned on Reddit. It's the single most-cited domain in ChatGPT & Perplexity. 

6. Use structured comparisons and lists. Remember that ChatGPT loves to ""borrow"" entire answers in chunks rather than do the thinking itself.

7. Make fewer images and more tables. AI engines can't see images well.

8. Measure your influence, not just clicks. The vast majority of AI search is zero-click (but it can still be highly influential.)

9. Stay on top of citation drift. Half of domains cited change in a given month.

LEVEL 6: Demand Creation Investments (some people call this “brand”) - Leverage custom analytics to analyze the performance of the (relatively insignificant) amount of budget that currently goes to this category using MTA, MMM, customer research or other means. 

LEVEL 7: THE DATA MODEL. To access this level of connected compound metrics that create fast, clear granular insights, you need the foresight, planning, and architecture to construct a CRM and Financial data model for your go-to-market that collects & analyzes the data as 1 REVENUE FACTORY rather than 4-6 silo’d departments.

The days of Marketing leaders asking for an arbitrary amount of “more budget” each year or applying blanket % increases across the GTM are OVER. 

-GTM Budgets, Departmental Allocations, and Allocations across the customer lifecycle can and should be set based on a clear process and data. 

-Business cases for increased GTM budgets, such as Marketing budget increases, should be easy to prepare & OBVIOUS whether or not to approve

-Imbalances of investment across the customer lifecycle, relative to performance, should be OBVIOUS to flag and address through GTM investment portfolio rebalancing

In fact, it has been for more than 5 years. The data was clear in 2018 that this strategy of getting tons of cheap MQLs so our SDRs can cold call them results in:

-Untenable customer acquisition cost (CAC)
-Extreme sales/marketing alignment issues 
-Low Sales productivity 
-Poor Marketing ROI 
-Totally breaks with scale 

But we were in the boom times from 2018-2022. Money was cheap and companies were operating for “growth at all costs”. Investors pushed companies to deploy massive amounts of capital to grow, regardless of the unit economics. 

Most companies didn’t care (or didn’t even look at the data to see) that their “MQLs” converted to customers at 0.1% (1 out of 1,000 “leads” actually become a customer). This extreme inefficiency forced companies to overhire SDRs and Sales Reps to sort through all this garbage trying to find a needle in a haystack. Marketing programs, SDR headcount, and Sales headcount costs bloated across the entire GTM. 

Now, it’s 2024 and there’s been a total 180-degree turn in B2B. Every company is forced to operate for “profitable, efficient growth”. 

-Revenue growth rates are down > 50%
-NRR has consistently declined for the past 6+ quarters
-CAC payback periods have more than doubled to 36 to 48+ months
-Budgets are tightening
-GTM teams are shrinking
-More layoffs are coming
-And unit economics and EBITDA margin are now the top priorities

Companies are stuck making incremental optimizations to these outdated models like trying to improve the MQL:SQL conversion rate by 2% or improve outbound connect rates by 1% or lowering the cost per lead by $12. 

But Incremental improvements aren’t going to get the job done.

This new era of profitable, efficient growth (PEG) requires a fundamentally new approach to B2B Go-To-Market. The financial metrics *require* it and we've just about reached the breaking point.

p.s. Changing from an MQL to an MQA feels like a good solution but doesn’t solve the root cause problem. It’s the exact same motion just with a different trigger to activate outbound Sales. Lots of companies and executives I talk to are scratching their heads wondering why ABM and account intent data isn’t living up to its promise.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chriswalker171_b2b-gtm-marketing-activity-7194692908120170497-MvAy?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACvfqDkBwAMJeVXyKg234H8-yBYMOKl23bo,2024-05-10T13:41:00.226Z

Why does this suck you ask? Oh let me count the ways.

1. Let’s just assume you can fix the intro to make it less robot, the problem is that because the targeting is just “founders” dude literally told me about my own work and completely violated the teachings, without even addressing that. Which mean it’s a lie, he didn’t read my work. So the message is now hollow.

Let’s now also assume he fixed the “personalized” line and it felt unique an authentic and like he meant it. Just go with me.

2. Here’s the hardest part, the insight, just describing my situation. Well bro is cooked out the gate, because his insight is literally what I solve for… so he has NO CHANCE.

3. A value prop of we save money is not nearly as good as “I already did something useful for you, want more?” That’s what a true PVP would look like.

Personalized emails, no matter how well done, can’t recover from poor lists. There’s no message no universe where I would buy this.

If you’re selling pregnancy test kits you should target women who go to fertility clinics monthly. 

Because no amount of amazing personalized messages will convince a gay man he should buy a pregnancy test.

Not to put too fine of a point on this, but if you manually inspect your list and you find someone that literally sells a variant of what you do, then your list sucks. And if your list sucks, your message has no chance.

You can’t write your way out of a targeting problem, but you can target your way out of a pipeline problem.

The real question is, do you REALLY know who should and shouldn’t buy and why? 

Answer that question first and the targeting and messaging will be easy, because it’s just weeding out the bad prospects and describing to the good ones why they should receive your message.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordancrawford_ai-message-personalization-is-a-cancer-on-activity-7413977865991467008-nLTe?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADtNJIwB7YeBWk5OSR57XvTciKjhzeBfg7M,2026-01-05T16:21:08.300Z

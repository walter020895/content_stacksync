# Nacho Idea Legos Analysis

**Data Source:** 477 posts from GTM LinkedIn creators (Chris Walker, Jordan Crawford, Kyle Poyar, Dave Gerhardt, etc.)
**Outliers Analyzed:** 300 (top performers by outlier score)

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Hook Type Performance (What Actually Works for GTM)

| Hook Type | Usage | Avg Engagement | Insight |
|-----------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Experimenter** | 10% | **548** | HIGHEST - "I tested X" wins in GTM |
| **Fortune Teller** | 21% | **452** | Predictions about GTM trends |
| **Contrarian** | 12% | **406** | Calling BS works (Nacho's strength) |
| **Teacher** | 53% | 369 | Most common, baseline |
| **Investigator** | 1% | 195 | Underused |
| **Magician** | 3% | 157 | Less effective in GTM space |

**Insight for Nacho:** Experimenter hooks ("I tested X", "Here's the data") get **49% more engagement** than Teacher hooks. This matches Nacho's "show the receipts" operator style.

---

### 2. Topic Performance

| Topic | Share | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| GTM/Sales | 48% | **Nacho's home turf** |
| AI/Automation | 23% | Hot topic, ties to Clay/automation |
| Marketing | 20% | B2B marketing strategy |
| Pricing/Monetization | 3% | Underexplored opportunity |
| Tools/Tech | 2% | Clay, APIs, automation tools |

**Insight for Nacho:** He should own the **GTM + AI/Automation intersection** - it's hot but he can bring the operator credibility others lack.

---

### 3. Structure Performance

| Structure | Share | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| List Post | 48% | Dominant format |
| Observation/Opinion | 28% | Strong opinions work |
| Short Punch | 14% | **Higher in GTM than tech** |
| Story | 5% | Personal journey posts |
| Question | 4% | Engagement drivers |

**Insight for Nacho:** "Short Punch" (14%) is more common in GTM than engineering (8%). GTM audience responds to quick, punchy takes.

4. **War-time operations** - Survival mode GTM

### Structures to Try:
1. **Experimenter List** - "I tested X for 90 days. Here's what happened:"

## NACHO'S DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITY

Most GTM LinkedIn is:
- Generic sales tips (Teacher)
- AI hype (Fortune Teller)
- Motivational fluff

**Nacho's edge:** War-time operator who **calls bullshit with receipts**.

The "Renaissance operator" angle (philosophy, history, Bible applied to GTM) is **completely unique** - no one else owns this space.

**Combine:**
- Experimenter credibility (data, tests, results)
- Contrarian voice (calls BS)
- Renaissance depth (connects to bigger ideas)

Salesforce sold to salespeople. Not C-Level Executives
Everyone else in 1999 was doing top-down enterprise sale: 

Six-month procurement cycles.
IT approval. 
Legal. 
Security.

Salesforce went around all of it.

They targeted small sales teams. 
Under 30 users. 
Companies where a manager could sign up with a credit card.

Get the users addicted first. Let them pressure their managers to pay.

By the time IT heard about it, the sales team was already using it every day.

This was considered very weird.
Enterprise software was supposed to be sold to executives.

But Salesforce understood something: users have more leverage than buyers think.

If your product is sticky enough, the users become your sales team.

Siebel was selling $500K licenses to CIOs. 
Salesforce was selling $50/month to sales reps.

Siebel is dead. Salesforce is a $250B company.

▶️ Sell to the person who uses it. Not the person who approves it.

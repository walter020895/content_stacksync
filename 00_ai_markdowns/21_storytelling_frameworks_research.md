# Storytelling Frameworks for LinkedIn & Short-Form Business Content

Research compiled: 2026-02-26

## 1. THE ABT FRAMEWORK (And-But-Therefore)

**Source**: Randy Olson, marine biologist turned filmmaker. Formulated in his 2013 TEDMED Talk and 2015 book *Houston, We Have A Narrative*.

### The Structure

```
[AGREEMENT] ___ AND ___ ,
[CONTRADICTION] BUT ___ ,
[CONSEQUENCE] THEREFORE ___ .
```

- **AND** = establishes the world. Two pieces of information that describe the situation. The audience nods along.
- **BUT** = introduces the conflict. The rug pull. The more they nodded during AND, the harder BUT hits.
- **THEREFORE** = delivers the resolution, consequence, or action.

### Why It Works

The ABT is the DNA of narrative. Every story, every argument, every pitch that holds attention follows this pattern. The alternative — AND...AND...AND (what Olson calls the "AAA" structure) — is the death of attention. It's a list. Lists don't create tension.

### LinkedIn Application

The ABT maps perfectly to a 150-250 word LinkedIn post:

- **AND** (lines 1-3): Set up the world the reader recognizes. Establish common ground. "Companies spend millions on CRM implementations. They hire consultants. They run 6-month rollouts."
- **BUT** (line 4-5): The turn. The thing that's broken. "But 70% of those implementations fail to deliver ROI within the first year."
- **THEREFORE** (remainder): The insight, reframe, or call to action. Not necessarily YOUR product — but the shift in thinking.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **AAA (And And And)**: "We do this AND this AND this AND also this." = a feature list, not a story.
- **DHY (Despite However Yet)**: Too hedging, too academic. Lacks the clean binary of ABT.
- Burying the BUT. If your contradiction comes in paragraph 4, you lost them in paragraph 2.

### Compression for Hooks

The ABT can power a single hook line:

"Every company wants real-time data. But most are still running batch syncs from 2019."

That's AND-BUT in two sentences. The THEREFORE is implied — it's the reason they keep reading.

## 2. THE PIXAR STORY SPINE

**Source**: Playwright Kenn Adams (1991), popularized as "Pixar's Rule #4" by Emma Coats.

### The Full Spine

```
Once upon a time, _______.
Every day, _______.
One day, _______.
Because of that, _______.
Because of that, _______.
Until finally, _______.
And ever since that day, _______.
```

### Compressed for LinkedIn (250 words)

The spine compresses into three beats:

1. **The Old Normal** (Once upon a time + Every day) — Pack the struggle and the status quo into 1-2 sentences.
2. **The Break** (One day + Because of that) — The event that changed everything. One action step, one consequence.
3. **The New Normal** (Until finally + Ever since) — The outcome and its lasting impact.

### LinkedIn Template

```
[HOOK: The old normal stated as a fact everyone recognizes]

[1-2 sentences of "every day" — what the world looked like before]

[One day — the event, the discovery, the shift]

[Because of that — the chain of consequences, kept to 2-3 sentences max]

[Until finally — the new reality]

[Closer: What this means for the reader]
```

### Why It Works for Business Content

- Forces a CHANGE. Without "one day," there's no story — just a description.
- The "because of that" chain creates causality, not just sequence. Things happen BECAUSE of other things, not AFTER them.
- "Ever since that day" = the lasting takeaway. This is where the post earns its share.

### Critical Rule

If your post doesn't have a clear "One day" moment — a specific event, decision, or realization — it's not a story. It's an opinion piece dressed as a story. That can work, but call it what it is.

## 3. MATTHEW DICKS — THE FIVE-SECOND MOMENT

**Source**: *Storyworthy* by Matthew Dicks (recommended by Dakota Robertson as the storytelling book for content creators).

### Core Principle

Every great story is about a FIVE-SECOND MOMENT of transformation. Not a topic. Not a theme. A specific instant where something shifted — a realization, a feeling, a discovery.

The purpose of every element in the story is to bring that single moment to the greatest clarity possible.

### The Inversion Rule

The ending of the story (the five-second moment) tells you what the beginning should be. The beginning must be the OPPOSITE of the end.

- If the moment is about realizing simplicity wins, start in complexity.
- If the moment is about trust, start in doubt.
- If the moment is about a product working, start with the failure.

### "But" and "Therefore" Over "And"

Dicks independently arrived at Olson's ABT insight: most people connect sentences with AND. The best storytellers use BUT and THEREFORE (and their synonyms: however, yet, as a result, which meant, so).

"And" = sequence.
"But/Therefore" = causation and surprise.

### LinkedIn Application

Before writing any post, answer: **What is the five-second moment?**

- "The moment the CFO saw the dashboard and went quiet."
- "The moment we realized the bottleneck wasn't the tool — it was the workflow."
- "The moment Salesforce bought Slack and the integration market shifted overnight."

Then build BACKWARD from that moment. Start at the opposite pole. Walk the reader to the moment. Stop.

### Homework for Life (Content Mining)

Dicks practices "Homework for Life" — at the end of every day, he writes down the most storyworthy moment of the day. For a LinkedIn content operation, this translates to: every conversation with a prospect, every demo, every internal meeting has a potential five-second moment. Capture it.

## 4. NICOLAS COLE & DICKIE BUSH — ATOMIC ESSAYS + 1/3/1

**Source**: Ship 30 for 30 program, *The Art and Business of Online Writing* by Nicolas Cole.

### The Atomic Essay

A single idea expressed in under 250 words. One idea. One format. One takeaway.

The constraint is the feature: 250 words forces clarity. If you can't say it in 250 words, you don't understand it well enough yet.

### The Headline Formula (5 Elements)

Every effective headline contains:

1. **The Number** — quantity, specificity (e.g., "7 reasons," "3 mistakes")
2. **The What** — the subject or topic
3. **The Who** — who this is for
4. **The Why** — the promise or problem solved
5. **Twist The Knife** — the emotional urgency ("...and what to do about it," "...before it's too late")

Not every headline needs all five. But the best ones have 3-4.

### The 1/3/1 Writing Structure

```
[1 sentence — the opener/hook, acts as a mini-headline]

[3 sentences — the body, can be a bulleted list or a compressed argument]

[1 sentence — the closer, a strong conclusion or reframe]
```

This is a REPEATABLE UNIT. An entire post can be 3-4 stacked 1/3/1 blocks.

**Variant**: 1/5/1 — same structure, two more sentences in the middle for added depth.

### The Memorable Writing Framework

Cole's overarching structure:

1. **Framework** — the concept, model, or principle
2. **Story** — a personal experience or example that brings the framework to life
3. **Actionable Advice** — what the reader should DO

This maps to LinkedIn as: Open with the insight. Tell the story. Close with the action.

### Open Loops (85 Methods)

Ship 30 for 30 cataloged 85 open loop methods for hooks. The core principle: create a gap between what the reader knows and what they want to know. The gap must be closed by reading the rest of the post.

Key open loop types for LinkedIn:
- **The Unexpected Number**: "I've written 5,000 articles. Only 12 went viral. Here's what they had in common."
- **The Contradiction**: "The worst career advice I ever got was the advice that made me successful."
- **The Specific Timestamp**: "At 2:47 AM on a Tuesday, I almost deleted the entire codebase."
- **The Name Drop Without Context**: "Salesforce just did something no one is talking about."

Critical rule: if you open a loop, close it. Unclosed loops = clickbait. Closed loops = storytelling.

## 5. JASMIN ALIC — HOOK + CONVICTION + STRUCTURE

**Source**: Jasmin Alic (Hey Jay), LinkedIn writing coach, 27 Proven LinkedIn Writing Tips.

### The Hook Is 90% of the Post

LinkedIn shows 3 lines before "see more." Those 3 lines ARE the post for 90% of scrollers. The hook must contain the entire value proposition — not tease it, CONTAIN it.

### Hook Architecture

- **Line 1**: The hook. One line. Make a PROMISE or state a PROVOCATION.
- **[space]**
- **Line 2**: The re-hook. Crush objections. If Line 1 makes them curious, Line 2 removes their reason to scroll past.

### The "Dear Son" Technique (Voice Calibration)

Start every draft by addressing someone you're comfortable with — your best friend, your kid, your neighbor. Write AS IF you're talking to them. This kills:
- Jargon
- Corporate voice
- Overly complex sentences
- Performative confidence

Then delete "Dear Son" and publish. The voice stays.

### Specificity Sells

Vague hooks die. Specific hooks convert.

- BAD: "I learned an important lesson about leadership."
- GOOD: "I fired my best engineer. Revenue went up 23%."

The specific detail is what makes it real. Real = trustworthy. Trustworthy = readable.

### Power Position = First, Not Last

Most writers build up to their strongest statement. Alic's rule: put the power statement FIRST. Lead with it. Everything after is evidence and expansion, not buildup.

### The 1-1-1 Rule

One post. One topic. One message. If your post is about two things, it's about zero things.

### Endings

The last line of a post has almost as much impact as the first. The ending should:
- Reframe (not restate) the hook
- Advance the idea one step further
- Or deliver the emotional payoff the hook promised

Never end with a question that's obviously rhetorical. Never end with "What do you think?" unless the question is genuinely interesting.

## 6. EDDIE SHLEYNER — MICRO-STORIES & VIGNETTES

**Source**: VeryGoodCopy newsletter, *Very Good Copy: 207 Micro-Lessons*.

### The Two-Element Micro-Article

Every VeryGoodCopy micro-article has exactly two elements:

1. **The Story** — a personal experience, observation, or anecdote
2. **The Lesson** — a principle about copywriting, creativity, or marketing

The story frames the lesson. The lesson gives the story purpose. Neither works alone.

### Vignettes vs. Stories

A vignette is NOT a story. It doesn't need:
- A beginning, middle, and end
- A conflict and resolution
- A plot

A vignette only needs to **convey an emotion**. It's a photograph in words — a snapshot of a moment.

### Why Vignettes Work for LinkedIn

LinkedIn's job: "quickly make me feel something." A vignette does exactly that. You don't need a full narrative arc. You need:
- A moment
- A feeling
- A connection to the reader's world

### Application to Business Content

Instead of telling the full story of a company's transformation, zoom into ONE moment:

- The silence in the room when the CEO sees the data.
- The Slack message at 11 PM that said "it's working."
- The look on the VP of Sales' face when the dashboard loaded in 2 seconds instead of 45.

That single moment, described with enough sensory detail, carries more weight than 500 words of explanation.

### Tightening and Expanding

Shleyner's practice of writing vignettes teaches how to zoom in on a moment and either TIGHTEN it (strip to essentials) or EXPAND it (add texture). This is the core editing skill for LinkedIn:
- If the post is flat, you need to EXPAND a moment (add the detail that makes it real).
- If the post is bloated, you need to TIGHTEN (cut everything that isn't the moment).

## 7. HEMINGWAY / CARVER — THE ICEBERG THEORY & MINIMALISM

### Hemingway's Iceberg Theory (Theory of Omission)

**Principle**: The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A story's power comes from what is LEFT OUT, not what is put in.

"If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened."

### How It Applies to LinkedIn

Most LinkedIn posts over-explain. They tell you the insight, then explain why it's an insight, then restate the insight in different words. The Iceberg approach:

1. **Know everything** about the topic — research deeply.
2. **Write very little** — only the surface. The tip.
3. **Trust the reader** to fill in the gap.

### Carver's Minimalism

Raymond Carver's technique:
- Short, simple sentences structured very simply
- Elliptical transitions — leaving more unsaid than said
- Focus on moments of revelation and subtle shifts
- No adjectives or adverbs in excess

### The Minimalist LinkedIn Test

For every sentence in a draft, ask:
1. Can the reader infer this without me stating it? If yes, cut.
2. Does this sentence repeat what the previous one implied? If yes, cut.
3. Does removing this sentence make the post STRONGER? If yes, cut.

### Practical Example

**Over-explained version**:
"We realized that the problem wasn't our technology. It wasn't that the system was broken. The real issue — the thing nobody wanted to admit — was that we were solving the wrong problem entirely. We had been focused on the wrong thing from the start."

**Hemingway version**:
"The system worked perfectly. We were solving the wrong problem."

Same insight. Fewer words. More impact. The reader fills in the rest.

### What Gets Left Out = What Gets Felt

In LinkedIn content specifically:
- Leave out the obvious conclusion — let the reader arrive there.
- Leave out the "this is why it matters" paragraph — if the story is good, it matters.
- Leave out the self-congratulation — the reader sees through it anyway.

## 8. THE OPEN LOOP & CURIOSITY GAP

### Open Loop (from TV/Film, adapted to social)

An open loop introduces a mystery, question, or incomplete idea that creates a mental gap. The human brain has an urgent need to close open loops — this is called the Zeigarnik Effect.

### Curiosity Gap (George Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory)

When people sense a gap between what they know and what they want to know, they feel a psychological itch that must be scratched. This is the engine behind every good hook.

### Application to LinkedIn Hooks

The hook opens a loop. The post closes it. The "see more" click is the bridge.

Types of curiosity gaps:
- **Knowledge gap**: "There's a metric most RevOps teams ignore. It predicts churn better than NPS."
- **Prediction gap**: "Salesforce made a bet in 2023 that nobody understood. It just paid off."
- **Contradiction gap**: "The companies spending the least on data infrastructure are getting the best results."
- **Personal gap**: "I almost quit my job last Tuesday."

### The Mandatory Rule

**Every loop must close.** An unclosed loop = clickbait. A closed loop = storytelling. The payoff must be proportional to the promise. If your hook promises a revelation, the post must deliver one.

## 9. SAHIL BLOOM — PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE STORYTELLING

### The Six Principles

1. **Clarity of Purpose**: Before writing, define what the story is trying to achieve and what success looks like.
2. **Define the Audience**: Who are they? What do they want — consciously and subconsciously — from this story?
3. **Establish Structure**: Stories need a beginning that "never stops beginning" (Spielberg). Every line should pull forward.
4. **Create Contrasts**: Use Nancy Duarte's "what is vs. what could be" framework. Describe reality, then describe the potential future. The contrast IS the narrative engine.
5. **Suspend Reality**: Allow the audience to experience a new reality while still grounded in their own.
6. **Keep It Simple**: A great story can be elevator-pitched to an uninformed party who immediately understands it.

### Bloom's Writing Approach

"Draft Fast, Edit Slow" — get the raw material out without judgment, then shape it with discipline. The first draft captures the energy. The edit captures the precision.

## 10. PROVEN LINKEDIN POST FRAMEWORKS (Copywriting Formulas)

### PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)

```
[Problem] — Name the pain the reader recognizes.
[Agitate] — Make it worse. Show the consequences of NOT solving it.
[Solution] — The reframe, the tool, the approach that fixes it.
```

Best for: posts that address a specific ICP pain point.

### BAB (Before - After - Bridge)

```
[Before] — The world with the problem.
[After] — The world with the problem solved.
[Bridge] — How to get from Before to After.
```

Best for: transformation stories, case studies.

### AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)

```
[Attention] — Hook with a bold claim or surprising fact.
[Interest] — Develop with detail and specificity.
[Desire] — Make the reader want the outcome.
[Action] — CTA or next step.
```

Best for: posts with a clear call to action (hiring, product, event).

### VSQ (Value - Story - Question)

```
[Value] — Lead with the insight or takeaway.
[Story] — Support with a narrative example.
[Question] — End with a genuine question that invites discussion.
```

Best for: engagement-focused posts where comments are the goal.

### 3-1-3 (Hook - Core - Takeaways)

```
[3 opening lines] — The hook and setup.
[1 core message] — The single insight.
[3 takeaways] — The practical applications.
```

Best for: educational and how-to content.

---

## 11. SCENE-BASED WRITING (Journalism Technique Applied to LinkedIn)

### The Anecdotal Lede

From feature journalism (Esquire, New Yorker, longform): begin with a vivid SCENE, not a thesis. The scene does the work of the thesis, but with sensory detail and emotional weight.

Gay Talese's "Frank Sinatra Has a Cold" (1966) — opens with details of where the singer is, who he's with, what he's doing. No thesis statement. The scene IS the statement.

### Elements of a Scene

1. **Setting** — where and when (specific)
2. **Character** — who (named, with a detail that makes them real)
3. **Action** — something happening in real time
4. **Revelation** — the character reveals something about themselves or the situation

### How to Apply to LinkedIn (250 words)

For posts about OTHER people (ego bait, celebration, shoutout):

```
[SCENE: 2-3 sentences that place the reader in a specific moment with the person]
[CONTEXT: 1-2 sentences of who this person is and why this moment matters]
[PIVOT: What happened because of this moment / what it revealed]
[CLOSE: What this says about them / what the reader should take away]
```

Example structure:
"It was 11 PM on a Thursday. [Person] was still in the Zoom, screen-sharing a Figma prototype that nobody had asked them to build. The rest of the team had signed off hours ago. [Context about who they are.] That prototype shipped 6 weeks later. It's now the feature their biggest customer cites in every renewal."

The SCENE carries the compliment. You never have to say "they're hardworking" or "they go above and beyond." The scene SHOWS it.

### Vignette vs. Full Scene

- **Full scene** = beginning, action, outcome. Best for posts about specific events.
- **Vignette** = a snapshot. No outcome needed. Best for evoking a feeling.

For LinkedIn, vignettes are usually enough. A 250-word post doesn't need a full scene — it needs one vivid image that the reader's brain completes.

## 12. SYNTHESIS — REPLICABLE RULES FOR EVERY POST

### Pre-Writing (Before Any Draft)

1. **What is the five-second moment?** (Dicks) — Name the single instant of transformation, realization, or shift.
2. **What is the ABT?** (Olson) — Write one sentence: "[Situation] AND [status quo], BUT [problem/contradiction], THEREFORE [insight/action]."
3. **Who is the audience?** (Bloom) — What do they want from this post, consciously and subconsciously?
4. **What loop are you opening?** — What's the gap between what the reader knows and what they'll learn?

### Writing (During the Draft)

5. **Lead with the strongest statement** (Alic) — Don't build up. Put the power first.
6. **Use 1/3/1 blocks** (Cole/Bush) — One sentence opener, three sentence body, one sentence closer. Stack as needed.
7. **Connect with BUT and THEREFORE, not AND** (Dicks/Olson) — Every transition should be causal, not sequential.
8. **One post, one topic, one message** (Alic) — If it's about two things, it's about zero.
9. **Specificity over abstraction** — Numbers, names, timestamps, details. "Tuesday at 2 PM" beats "recently."
10. **Show one scene, not the whole movie** (Shleyner/journalism) — Zoom into a moment. Let the reader extrapolate.

### Editing (After the Draft)

11. **Apply the Iceberg Test** (Hemingway) — For every sentence, ask: "Does removing this make the post stronger?" If yes, cut.
12. **Check for AND chains** (Dicks) — If three consecutive sentences start with "And" or use "also" / "additionally," restructure around BUT/THEREFORE.
13. **Close every loop** — Re-read the hook. Does the post deliver on its promise? If not, either rewrite the hook or rewrite the post.
14. **Ending advances, not restates** (Alic) — The closer must go one step BEYOND the hook, not reword it.
15. **The Dear Son test** (Alic) — Read the draft as if explaining to someone you trust. Cut anything you wouldn't say out loud.

### Format Rules

16. **3 lines before "see more"** — Those lines must contain the complete value proposition.
17. **Max 2-3 sentences per paragraph** — Mobile readability is non-negotiable.
18. **Line-break lists over bullet points** — No emojis, no arrows, no dashes. Just statements on separate lines.
19. **160-200 words sweet spot** — Enough for one story, one insight, one moment. Anything longer must justify its length.

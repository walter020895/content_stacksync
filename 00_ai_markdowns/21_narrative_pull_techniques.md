## CATEGORY 1: STRUCTURAL MOMENTUM TECHNIQUES

### 1.1 The Slippery Slide
**Source:** Joe Sugarman, *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook*
**Principle:** The sole purpose of the first sentence is to get the reader to read the second sentence. Every sentence is a rung on a slide — once they start, gravity does the work.
**Sub-techniques:**
- Keep first sentences short, sweet, and *almost incomplete*
- Short words, short sentences, short paragraphs = less friction
- "Seeds of curiosity" at paragraph endings: phrases that promise more is coming

**Before (fact-list):**
> Sarah founded the company in 2019. She raised a seed round. She hired 12 people. She launched the product.

**After (slippery slide):**
> Sarah had $2,400 in her checking account when she filed the incorporation papers. Nine months later, she had 12 people and a product — but no customers. So she did something her investors hated.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is the foundational technique for 200-word posts. Every sentence must earn the next.

---

### 1.2 The "But/Therefore" Rule
**Source:** Trey Parker & Matt Stone (South Park), widely adopted in screenwriting
**Principle:** Replace "and then" connections between sentences with "but" (introduces conflict) or "therefore" (shows consequence). "And then" = a list. "But/therefore" = a story.

**Before (and then):**
> She built the integration. And then she showed it to the sales team. And then they started using it. And then revenue went up.

**After (but/therefore):**
> She built the integration in three weeks. But when she showed it to the sales team, nobody opened it. Therefore she sat in on 14 sales calls to understand why. That's where she found the real problem.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is the single fastest fix for fact-listing. Test every sentence connection: is it "and then" or "but/therefore"?

---

### 1.3 Sentence Length Variation (The Music Rule)
**Source:** Gary Provost, *100 Ways to Improve Your Writing*
**Principle:** Uniform sentence length creates monotony. Varied length creates rhythm. The famous demonstration:

> "This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.
>
> Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony."

**Application to LinkedIn:**
- Use a one-word or two-word sentence after a complex one for punch
- Follow a long setup sentence with a short payoff
- Three short sentences in a row = tension building. One long one after = release.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — critical for mobile scroll rhythm. Short sentences stop thumbs. Long ones reward attention.

### 1.4 In Medias Res (Start in the Middle)
**Source:** Horace (Roman poet); standard in journalism, screenwriting, fiction
**Principle:** Skip the setup. Start in the action. The reader catches up through context clues. "Snatch the listener into the middle of things."

**Before (chronological):**
> In 2018, Maria graduated from Stanford. She got a job at Salesforce. After two years, she noticed a problem with their data pipeline. She decided to build a solution.

**After (in medias res):**
> Maria was three hours into debugging a data pipeline at 2am when she realized something: this wasn't a bug. It was the architecture. The whole thing was wrong. She'd spent two years at Salesforce before that night. She'd need two more to build what she saw.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — the hook line of every LinkedIn post should be in medias res. Never start with backstory.

---

## CATEGORY 2: INFORMATION CONTROL TECHNIQUES

### 2.1 Open Loops
**Source:** Jay Acunzo; Nathan Baugh; rooted in Zeigarnik Effect (1927)
**Principle:** Introduce a question, mystery, or incomplete idea. The reader's brain physiologically cannot let go of unresolved information (Zeigarnik Effect — people remember interrupted tasks 90% better than completed ones). Open the loop early. Close it later.

**Two levels:**
- **Macro loop:** The hook opens a question the entire post answers ("She turned down $40M. Here's why that was the smartest move of her career.")
- **Micro loop:** A sentence opens a small question the next 2-3 sentences answer ("But there was a problem nobody saw coming.")

**Before (no loop):**
> Plaid built API connections to banks. Banks didn't want to cooperate. Plaid found workarounds. They grew to $13B.

**After (open loop):**
> Plaid needed something no bank wanted to give them. Every door was closed. So they found a window — and what they built through it became a $13B company.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — the hook IS an open loop. But micro-loops within the body keep pull alive after the "See more" click.

---

### 2.2 The Delayed Reveal
**Source:** Jane Friedman; MasterClass screenwriting; narrative journalism tradition
**Principle:** Withhold the subject's identity, the outcome, or the key detail — then reveal it for impact. "Rule of Three" variant: tease, hint, reveal.

**Before (no delay):**
> Canva is now worth $40B. CEO Melanie Perkins started it as a college student in Perth.

**After (delayed reveal):**
> She pitched 100 investors from a apartment in Perth. She was 19. Every single one said no. The company she was pitching? It's now worth $40B. Her name is Melanie Perkins.

**Caution:** The delay must serve the story. If you withhold just to be clever, readers feel manipulated. The reveal should reframe everything before it.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — extremely effective for LinkedIn hooks. Withhold the company name or person's name for 3-5 lines. The reveal becomes the payoff.

---

### 2.3 The Curiosity Gap
**Source:** George Loewenstein (1994, information gap theory); Chip & Dan Heath, *Made to Stick*
**Principle:** Curiosity fires when people notice a gap between what they know and what they want to know. Create the gap by telling them *almost* enough.

**The SUCCESs framework (Heath Brothers):**
- **S**imple — one core idea
- **U**nexpected — violate a pattern to get attention
- **C**oncrete — sensory, specific details
- **C**redible — anchored in verifiable reality
- **E**motional — make them feel, not just think
- **S**tories — the delivery vehicle

**How "Unexpected" creates pull:**
Surprise makes us pay attention and think. But surprise must be "post-dictable" — the twist makes sense after you hear it, but you didn't see it coming.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — the "Unexpected" principle is why contrarian hooks outperform ("The best sales teams don't sell."). The gap between the statement and the reader's belief creates pull.

---

### 2.4 Seeds of Curiosity
**Source:** Joe Sugarman, *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook*
**Principle:** End paragraphs or sections with small forward-pointing phrases that promise more information ahead. Not full bucket brigades (those are often slop) — just enough to signal "keep going."

**Examples that work in persona voice:**
- "So we did."
- "That wasn't the hard part."
- "But here's what nobody talks about."
- "The numbers tell a different story."

**Examples that are slop (per 01_ai_slops.md):**
- "Here's the thing."
- "Let that sink in."
- "But wait, there's more."

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — but only voice-native seeds. The connector must sound like something the persona would actually say. Generic seeds = AI smell.

---

## CATEGORY 3: CONNECTIVE TISSUE TECHNIQUES

### 3.1 Causal Connectors (Implicit and Explicit)
**Source:** Harvard Writing Center; UW-Madison Writing Center; narrative journalism
**Principle:** The invisible "because" between sentences is what makes prose feel like a story instead of a list. Sometimes state it. Sometimes imply it.

**Explicit causal connectors:**
- "So she..." (consequence)
- "That's when..." (turning point)
- "Because of that..." (direct cause)
- "Which meant..." (chain reaction)

**Implicit causation (no connector word, but cause-effect is felt):**
> "Her parents offered to help. She said no."
(No connector needed. The juxtaposition IS the connection — the reader infers the "but" and the pride/stubbornness behind the refusal.)

**Key insight:** If the cause-effect relationship is obvious, you don't need a connector word. The period between the two sentences IS the connector. Adding "however" or "but" would weaken it.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is the most important technique for avoiding both fact-listing AND connector slop. Let the reader's brain do the connecting work when the relationship is clear.

---

### 3.2 The Pronoun Bridge
**Source:** Journalism fundamentals; copywriting practice
**Principle:** Start a new sentence with a pronoun or reference that only makes sense if you read the previous sentence. This creates a micro-dependency chain.

**Example:**
> She pitched 100 investors. Every single one said no. *That* rejection became the company's origin story. *It* forced her to bootstrap. *And bootstrapping* taught her something venture-backed founders never learn.

Each sentence leans on the one before it. Remove any sentence and the next one doesn't land.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — natural, invisible, creates flow without artificial connectors.

---

### 3.3 Juxtaposition (The Binary)
**Source:** Nathan Baugh (Micro Storytelling); screenwriting; rhetoric
**Principle:** Place two contrasting ideas side by side. The contrast itself creates meaning without needing explanation. Juxtaposition is the "best friend" of short-form storytelling.

**Forms:**
- **Before/After:** "Three months ago, she couldn't get a meeting. Last Tuesday, she turned one down."
- **Expectation/Reality:** "Everyone assumed the CTO built it. The intern did."
- **Scale contrast:** "12-person startup. $4B pipeline."

**Why it works in short-form:** Juxtaposition is compression. Two images placed next to each other do the work of a paragraph of explanation. The reader's brain fills the gap between them — and that gap-filling IS engagement.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is the native format of LinkedIn hooks. Binary structures ("X, not Y" / "Everyone thought X. The truth was Y.") are the most engagement-efficient sentence structure for 200-word posts.

---

### 3.4 Temporal Anchoring
**Source:** Narrative journalism; Gay Talese; Tolstoy; screenwriting
**Principle:** Drop a specific time reference to teleport the reader into a moment. Times, dates, ages, seasons — any temporal marker signals "this is a real moment, pay attention."

**Examples:**
- "It was 2am on a Tuesday."
- "She was 23."
- "Three weeks before the IPO."
- "Eighteen months. That's how long it took."

**Why it creates pull:** A temporal marker signals that a *scene* is starting, not a summary. The reader's brain shifts from "processing information" mode to "watching a movie" mode.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — one temporal anchor in the first 2 lines can transform a post from abstract to cinematic. "In 2019" is weak. "At 2am in a WeWork that smelled like burnt coffee" is scene-setting.

---

## CATEGORY 4: SCENE-SETTING TECHNIQUES

### 4.1 The One-Sentence Scene (Talese Method)
**Source:** Gay Talese, "Frank Sinatra Has a Cold" (Esquire, 1966); New Yorker profile tradition
**Principle:** Pack setting, character, mood, and tension into a single sentence using specific, sensory details.

**The famous opening:**
> "Frank Sinatra, holding a glass of bourbon in one hand and a cigarette in the other, stood in a dark corner of the bar between two attractive but fading blondes who sat waiting for him to say something."

**What's packed in:** Character (Sinatra), props (bourbon, cigarette), setting (dark corner, bar), supporting characters (the blondes), mood (waiting, tension), and status (they're waiting for *him*).

**How to apply to LinkedIn (200-word constraint):**
You get ONE scene-setting sentence. Make it count. Include:
1. A person (name or role)
2. An action (what they're doing)
3. A specific detail (bourbon, not "a drink"; 2am, not "late")

**Before:** "She started the company after leaving her corporate job."
**After:** "She wrote the first line of code in a $400/month apartment in Medell&iacute;n, still wearing her Deloitte lanyard."

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — one scene sentence in the first 3 lines creates a "movie" in the reader's head. Everything after it benefits from that image.

---

### 4.2 The Anchoring Detail
**Source:** Copyblogger; MasterClass; narrative nonfiction tradition
**Principle:** One hyper-specific detail makes the entire story believable. Numbers, brand names, locations, prices — anything verifiable or sense-able.

**Why it works:** The specific unlocks the universal. "A flower" is generic. "A bruised magnolia petal caught in the arms of a windshield wiper" is cinematic. The more precise the imagery, the more universal the resonance — because it *feels true and lived.*

**Specificity hierarchy (weakest to strongest):**
1. "She had a small apartment." (abstract)
2. "She had a studio apartment." (category)
3. "She had a 400-square-foot studio." (number)
4. "She had a 400-square-foot studio above a laundromat in Bushwick." (number + place + texture)

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — one anchoring detail per post is enough. More than two and it becomes a scene that's too long for the format. Pick the ONE detail that makes the reader think "this is real."

---

### 4.3 Show Don't Tell (Action over Adjective)
**Source:** Universal writing principle; Chekhov; Hemingway; formalized in creative writing
**Principle:** Don't describe a state. Show the action that *implies* the state. "She was determined" is telling. "Her parents offered to help. She said no." is showing.

**Business writing translations:**
- TELLING: "The product was a failure."
- SHOWING: "Six months after launch, the dashboard showed 4 daily active users. Three of them were employees."

- TELLING: "She was a great leader."
- SHOWING: "When the round fell through, she called every employee personally before the board."

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is the cure for "inspirational tone" posts. Show what happened. Let the reader decide the adjective.

---

## CATEGORY 5: RHYTHM AND PATTERN TECHNIQUES

### 5.1 Pattern Interrupt
**Source:** NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming); adapted into copywriting by Gary Halbert and others
**Principle:** Establish a pattern, then break it. The break forces the reader to re-engage. Works at sentence level, paragraph level, and structural level.

**Sentence-level interrupt:**
> "She raised $2M. Then $10M. Then $50M. Then she stopped."

The "Then she stopped" breaks the escalation pattern. The reader's brain was predicting the next number. The interruption = surprise = attention.

**Structural interrupt:**
In a post that's flowing in narrative mode, insert one short declarative sentence on its own line:

> "Nobody noticed.
>
> For three quarters, the pipeline numbers looked fine on the surface..."

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — extremely powerful at the mobile scroll level. A one-line paragraph after a three-line paragraph = visual pattern interrupt that stops the thumb.

---

### 5.2 The McKee Gap (Expectation vs. Result)
**Source:** Robert McKee, *Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting*
**Principle:** Every compelling scene splits open a gap between what the character *expects* to happen and what *actually* happens. When expectation equals result, the scene is dead. When they diverge, the story lives.

**Application to LinkedIn posts:**
The post's tension comes from the gap between what the reader expects (conventional wisdom) and what actually happened. The wider the gap, the stronger the pull.

**Before (no gap):**
> She built a better product. Customers switched. Revenue grew.

**After (McKee gap):**
> She built a better product. But customers didn't switch — they barely noticed. What *did* work had nothing to do with the product.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — the "McKee Gap" IS the LinkedIn hook formula. Conventional wisdom says X. Reality was Y. The gap between X and Y is the reason to read.

---

### 5.3 Micro-Escalation
**Source:** Screenwriting (no regression rule); Sugarman (progressive engagement)
**Principle:** Each sentence should raise the stakes slightly higher than the last. Never go backwards in intensity.

**Example of escalation:**
> One customer complained. Then five. Then the VP of Sales called an emergency meeting. By Friday, the entire roadmap had changed.

**Example of regression (broken):**
> The VP of Sales called an emergency meeting. One customer had complained. Others followed. The roadmap changed.

The second version peaks too early (emergency meeting in sentence 1), then explains backwards. The first version builds.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — within a 200-word post, you have maybe 4-5 "beats" of escalation before the closer. Each beat should be slightly higher stakes than the last.

---

## CATEGORY 6: PSYCHOLOGICAL PULL TECHNIQUES

### 6.1 The Zeigarnik Effect (Incompleteness Drive)
**Source:** Bluma Zeigarnik (1927); applied by George Loewenstein (1994)
**Principle:** The brain holds onto unresolved information with 90% better retention than completed information. Incomplete tasks create cognitive tension that demands resolution.

**Writing application:** Every open question is an incomplete task in the reader's mind. The hook opens the task. The body delays completion. The closer resolves it.

**How to weaponize it in LinkedIn:**
- Open: "She turned down $40M."
- Body: Explains the context, the reasoning, the stakes
- Close: "That company is now worth $4B."

The reader *cannot leave* between the open and the close without experiencing cognitive discomfort.

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is the psychological engine behind every high-performing hook.

---

### 6.2 The Unexpectedness Principle
**Source:** Chip & Dan Heath, *Made to Stick*
**Principle:** Surprise makes us pay attention and think. The extra attention sears unexpected events into memory. But: surprise must be "post-dictable" — it has to make sense *after* you hear it.

**How to create "post-dictable surprise" in business writing:**
1. State a conventional belief the reader holds
2. Reveal a fact that contradicts it
3. Show why the contradiction makes sense

**Example:**
> Everyone knows you need product-market fit before scaling. [conventional belief]
> Slack didn't have it. [surprise]
> They had something rarer: a product that teams adopted *despite* the company's sales team, not because of it. [post-dictable explanation]

**LinkedIn applicable:** YES — this is why "contrarian take" posts work. But the contrarian claim must be *true and explainable*, not just edgy.

## THE 5 NON-NEGOTIABLES FOR LINKEDIN NARRATIVE PULL

1. **Every sentence connection is "but/therefore," never "and then."** If you can insert "and then" between two sentences and it reads fine, the second sentence isn't earning its place.

2. **One open loop in the hook. One micro-loop after "See more."** The hook's job is to open a question. The body's job is to delay the answer while building context. Two micro-loops maximum in 200 words.

3. **One anchoring detail in the first 3 lines.** A number, a place, a brand name, a time. Something concrete that signals "this is real."

4. **Escalate, never regress.** Each beat should raise stakes. If the most dramatic moment is in the hook, the body has nowhere to go.

5. **Let juxtaposition do the connecting.** Two contrasting facts placed side by side don't need a connector word. The gap between them IS the story.

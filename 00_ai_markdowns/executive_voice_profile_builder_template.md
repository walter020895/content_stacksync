# Executive Voice Profile
### Ghostwriter Personality Extraction Framework

---

## How This Document Works

**This template is designed to be executed alongside a raw interview transcript.**

You will receive two files:
1. **This template** — the structure and instructions for extracting a personality profile
2. **A transcript** — a natural, conversational interview (not a rigid Q&A)

**Your job:** Read the transcript carefully, then fill out every section of this template by extracting, interpreting, and *inferring* from what was said. The interview is intentionally loose and conversational — it does not follow a fixed list of questions. The interviewer lets the person talk naturally, follows threads, and creates space for honesty. This means:

- **Answers won't be labeled.** The person won't say "my core belief is..." — they'll tell a story, and the belief will be embedded inside it. Your job is to find it.
- **Not every section will have a direct answer in the transcript.** Some sections require inference — connecting two things they said in different moments, reading emotional subtext, or noticing what they avoided.
- **Repetition is signal.** If they circle back to the same idea, phrase, or story more than once, that's a core element. Flag it.
- **Energy shifts are signal.** When the transcript shows them getting more animated, going longer, or getting quieter — that's meaningful. Note where those shifts happen and what triggered them.
- **Contradictions are signal.** If they say one thing early and something slightly different later, don't resolve it — capture the tension. That's where their most authentic voice lives.
- **Casual asides are gold.** The throwaway comments, the jokes, the "I don't know why I'm telling you this" moments — these often carry more voice truth than the polished answers.

### Processing Instructions

When filling this template from a transcript, follow this sequence:

1. **First pass — Read the full transcript without taking notes.** Get the feel of the person. Notice your gut impression.
2. **Second pass — Highlight and extract.** Pull exact quotes, recurring phrases, stories, beliefs, emotional moments, and anything that reveals how they think (not just what they think).
3. **Third pass — Fill the template section by section.** For each section:
   - Start with what's directly stated in the transcript
   - Then add what's implied or inferable
   - Then note what's missing or unclear (mark with ⚠️)
   - Use direct quotes from the transcript wherever possible — wrapped in quotation marks with brief context
4. **Fourth pass — Write the inference sections (Part 9).** This requires you to step back and interpret the whole picture. What patterns emerged? What wasn't said? Where is the gap between how they see themselves and how they actually came across?
5. **Final pass — Complete the Quick-Reference Voice Card (Part 10).** This should be the distillation of everything above into an at-a-glance tool.

### Confidence Markers

Use these throughout the template to indicate how grounded each insight is:

- **🟢 Direct** — They said this explicitly. You have a quote.
- **🟡 Inferred** — They didn't say this directly, but it's strongly supported by multiple moments in the transcript.
- **🔴 Speculative** — This is your interpretation based on limited signal. Needs validation in a follow-up conversation.
- **⚠️ Gap** — The transcript doesn't address this at all. Flag for a follow-up question.

## Part 1: The Surface — Who They Present As

*This section captures the obvious. What anyone would notice after a 15-minute conversation.*

**Transcript extraction guide:** Look for how they introduce themselves, describe their role, or frame their work when the interviewer opens the conversation. Pay attention to what they emphasize first — that's their self-concept hierarchy.

### 1.1 Professional Identity in Their Own Words
How do they describe what they do? Not the LinkedIn headline — the version they give when someone asks "so what do you do?" Capture the exact framing, the verbs they choose, the scope they claim or minimize.

> *[Capture here — use their exact words from the transcript when possible]*

### 1.2 The Energy Signature
What kind of energy came through in the transcript? Where did they give short, clipped answers vs. where did they go on long, passionate tangents? Note the baseline energy AND the spikes.

> *[Capture here]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Reference specific moments — e.g., "When asked about X, they gave a 3-sentence answer. When the topic shifted to Y, they talked for 2 minutes straight without prompting."]*

### 1.3 Self-Perception vs. Observable Reality
How do they see themselves as a communicator and leader? And where does that self-perception mismatch with what you observe in the transcript? (Example: they say "I'm pretty laid back" but their language around quality standards is intense and uncompromising.)

> *[Capture here]*

### 1.4 The Stated Values
What principles or beliefs did they name explicitly? List them, but flag which ones felt rehearsed (they delivered them cleanly, like a tagline) vs. which ones felt lived-in (they stumbled into them, circled back, or got emotional).

> *[Capture here]*

---

## Part 2: The Wiring — How Their Brain Works

*This is where ghostwriting lives or dies. You're not capturing what they think; you're capturing HOW they think.*

**Transcript extraction guide:** Don't look at what they said — look at the ORDER in which they said things. When asked an open question, what did they reach for first? A story? A principle? A number? A person? That sequence IS their cognitive architecture.

### 2.1 Cognitive Entry Point
When they encounter a new problem or idea, where does their mind go first? Do they start with the people affected, the system it breaks, the principle at stake, the data, or the story? Look at how they answered the interviewer's open-ended questions — the first thing they reached for reveals this.

> *[Capture here]*

**Pattern observed:** (People-first / Systems-first / Principle-first / Data-first / Story-first / Other)

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote the opening of 2-3 answers that reveal this pattern]*

### 2.2 Reasoning Architecture
How do they build an argument? Look at the transcript for moments where they explained something complex. Did they stack evidence linearly, or orbit a central idea with examples? Did they reason from first principles or from lived experience? Did they think in analogies, in contrasts, or in sequences?

> *[Capture here]*

**Dominant pattern:** (Linear builder / Orbital thinker / Contrast thinker / Analogy-driven / First-principles / Experience-anchored)

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote a passage where they built an argument or explained something — annotate the structure]*

### 2.3 Decision-Making Logic
When they described past decisions, what was the internal framework? Did they weigh tradeoffs analytically, follow conviction, consult people, or trust instinct? What do they optimize for: speed, accuracy, fairness, or impact?

> *[Capture here]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Reference a specific decision they described and how they framed the "why"]*

### 2.4 Attention Pattern
What do they notice that others miss? What are they tuned into — team dynamics, market signals, language, inconsistencies, emotions, systems? This is the perceptual lens everything you write for them should be filtered through.

> *[Capture here]*

### 2.5 Complexity Tolerance
Do they simplify to clarify, or do they hold complexity because they think the nuance matters? Look at the transcript — when explaining something complicated, did they boil it down or keep all the layers? This determines sentence structure, paragraph length, and whether you can use clean binaries or need to qualify.

> *[Capture here]*

### 2.6 Time Orientation
When they think about their work and leadership, do they anchor in the past (lessons, stories), the present (what's happening now), or the future (where things are going)? Count how many of their examples are retrospective vs. forward-looking.

> *[Capture here]*

**Dominant tense:** (Past-anchored / Present-grounded / Future-oriented / Blended: ___)

---

## Part 3: The Voice — How They Sound

*Not what they say. How they say it. The music underneath the words.*

**Transcript extraction guide:** This section requires you to read the transcript almost like sheet music. Ignore content — focus on rhythm, word choice, sentence length, and pattern. If the transcript captures verbal fillers or pauses, even better.

### 3.1 Pace and Rhythm
Do they speak in short, punchy bursts? Long, winding sentences with embedded clauses? Do they pause dramatically or build momentum? Pull 3-4 representative passages from the transcript and analyze sentence length and flow.

> *[Capture here]*

**Writing rhythm implication:** (Short and punchy / Medium flow with pauses / Long and layered / Variable — accelerates on passion topics)

**Transcript evidence:** *[Paste 2-3 raw passages that show their natural rhythm]*

### 3.2 Signature Phrases and Verbal Tics
What words, phrases, or expressions kept showing up? Include filler patterns too — they reveal thought transitions. Scan the entire transcript for repetition. If a word or phrase appears 3+ times, it's a signature element.

> *[List exact phrases with frequency if possible]*

### 3.3 Vocabulary Fingerprint
What's their natural vocabulary register? Note words they gravitate toward AND words they conspicuously avoid. Look for patterns: do they use more sensory language (feel, see, touch) or cognitive language (think, know, understand)?

**Words they use often:**
> *[List here — pull directly from transcript]*

**Words/tones they avoid or reject:**
> *[List here — note if they explicitly rejected certain language, or if certain registers were simply absent]*

**Vocabulary register:** (Technical-precise / Conversational-direct / Metaphorical-poetic / Academic-structured / Hybrid: ___)

### 3.4 The Humor Profile
Did humor show up in the transcript? What kind? Self-deprecating, observational, dry, absurdist, sarcastic? When did it appear — to deflect, to connect, to make a point land? Is humor safe territory for their content, or a line they don't cross publicly?

> *[Capture here]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote any humorous moments and note what triggered them]*

### 3.5 Emotional Range in Language
Where on the spectrum do they naturally sit: analytical-cool or emotionally-warm? And what topics or moments in the transcript pushed them out of their default range?

> *[Capture here]*

**Default register:** (Cool-analytical / Warm-empathetic / Sharp-urgent / Calm-grounded / Other: ___)
**Moves to _____ when talking about:** *[topic/trigger]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote moments where the emotional register shifted — what came right before?]*

### 3.6 Sentence Architecture Preferences
Based on how they naturally talk in the transcript, which structures would feel native in their writing?

- [ ] Short declarative statements ("This is the problem. And no one talks about it.")
- [ ] Questions that make the reader think ("What if the tool was never the bottleneck?")
- [ ] Contrast structures ("Everyone optimizes for X. The real leverage is Y.")
- [ ] Story-then-lesson ("I once had a client who... That taught me...")
- [ ] Numbered clarity ("Three things matter here.")
- [ ] Layered conditionals ("If you've ever... then you already know...")
- [ ] Other: ___

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote examples from the transcript that match checked patterns]*

### 3.7 The "Never" List
What tones, styles, or approaches would feel immediately wrong if written under their name? Look for moments in the transcript where they explicitly rejected a style, cringed at an idea, or distanced themselves from a way of communicating.

> *[Capture here]*

---

## Part 4: The Emotional Architecture — What Drives Them

*Every leader has an emotional operating system that governs what they create, fight for, and can't ignore. This is the engine of their content.*

**Transcript extraction guide:** This section lives mostly between the lines. Listen for what made them emotional (not just what they said was important). Notice where they sped up, slowed down, used stronger language, or got quiet. The transcript's emotional peaks map directly to content energy.

### 4.1 The Core Motivation
What's the deep driver? Not the business mission statement — the personal, pre-career thing that makes them care about the work they do. This often surfaces in the transcript through origin stories, "why I started this" moments, or what they'd do if money didn't matter.

> *[Capture here]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote the moment(s) where this surfaced]*

### 4.2 The Wound or Tension
What experience or pattern created the edge in their perspective? Most strong voices are forged by something — being underestimated, seeing injustice, being wrong publicly, building something that failed. Look for moments in the transcript where they referenced a painful experience with visible energy or conviction.

> *[Capture here]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote or reference the moment — note if they told it calmly (processed) or with heat (still active)]*

### 4.3 What They Protect
What do they fight for even when it's costly or inconvenient? This might be their team's autonomy, a standard of quality, a type of person who gets overlooked, or a principle they won't bend on. Look for "I always..." or "I will never..." type statements in the transcript.

> *[Capture here]*

### 4.4 What Makes Them Proud (Quietly)
Not achievements they'd put on a resume. The small signals that tell them they're doing it right. In the transcript, this often shows up when the interviewer asks about what energizes them or makes a good day good — and they mention something surprisingly small or specific.

> *[Capture here]*

### 4.5 What Frustrates or Angers Them
What patterns, behaviors, or industry norms make them frustrated? Look for the sharpest language in the transcript, the moments where they got most opinionated or where their pace changed. This is where their most energetic content will come from.

> *[Capture here]*

**Transcript evidence:** *[Quote the moments with the sharpest energy]*

### 4.6 Their Relationship to Vulnerability
How comfortable are they with being open? In the transcript, did they share struggle, doubt, or personal stories freely? Did they hedge? Did they go there and then pull back? This calibrates how personal their content can be.

> *[Capture here]*

**Vulnerability comfort level:** (Open book / Strategic sharer / Growing into it / Private — uses lessons, not feelings / Off-limits)

**Transcript evidence:** *[Note moments where they were most/least open and what the topic was]*

### 4.7 The Emotional Aftertaste They Want to Leave
After someone reads their content, what should they *feel*? Not think — feel. Look for this in the transcript when they describe content they admire, the impact they want to have, or how they want to be remembered as a communicator.

> *[Capture here]*

---

## Part 5: The Belief System — What They'd Stake Their Name On

*This is the thought leadership engine. The convictions that make their perspective worth following.*

**Transcript extraction guide:** Beliefs rarely arrive as neat statements. They hide inside stories ("and that's when I realized..."), inside frustrations ("the problem with this industry is..."), and inside repeated themes. Triangulate from multiple moments.

### 5.1 Core Beliefs (Non-Negotiable)
What do they believe so deeply that they'd defend it even if they were the only one in the room? These are the pillars every piece of content should orbit around.

1. > *[Belief + transcript evidence]*
2. > *[Belief + transcript evidence]*
3. > *[Belief + transcript evidence]*

### 5.2 Contrarian Positions
Where do they break from the mainstream in their industry? What does "everyone" believe that they think is wrong, incomplete, or lazy? Look for "most people think... but actually..." patterns in the transcript.

> *[Capture here]*

### 5.3 Pattern Recognition — What They See Coming
What future trends or shifts do they sense that others haven't caught yet? Look for forward-looking statements, "in 5 years" type predictions, or frustrations about the status quo that imply a vision for something better.

> *[Capture here]*

### 5.4 The Pet Peeves (Industry BS They Can't Stand)
What advice, trends, or narratives in their space make them cringe? In the transcript, look for eye-roll moments, sarcasm, or strong negative reactions to industry norms.

> *[Capture here]*

### 5.5 Hard-Won Lessons
What did they learn the painful way that they wish they'd known earlier? These usually surface when the interviewer asks about mistakes, pivots, or evolution. They make the most authentic content because the specificity of lived experience can't be faked.

> *[Capture here]*

### 5.6 The Unwritten Post
What's the message they've been wanting to share but haven't yet? What's holding them back? This sometimes surfaces directly ("I've been wanting to write about...") or indirectly (a topic they kept returning to with unusual energy but framed as not-yet-ready).

> *[Capture here]*

## Part 6: The Identity Layer — Who They Are Beneath the Role

*The stuff that doesn't fit a LinkedIn bio but shapes everything they write.*

**Transcript extraction guide:** This section draws from the more personal moments in the interview — origin stories, identity references, what they do outside work, who they feel connected to. If the conversation didn't go here, mark sections with ⚠️ for follow-up.

### 6.1 Formative Identity
What parts of their background, upbringing, culture, or personal history actively shape how they lead and think? Not every detail — just the ones that left fingerprints on their worldview.

> *[Capture here]*

### 6.2 The Arc They're On
Where are they in their personal/professional evolution right now? Are they in a building phase, a proving phase, a letting-go phase, or a legacy phase? Look at the tense and energy of most of their answers — builders talk about what's next, provers talk about what they've achieved, evolvers talk about what's changing.

> *[Capture here]*

**Current phase:** (Building / Proving / Consolidating / Evolving / Legacy / Other: ___)

### 6.3 The Audience in Their Head
When they write or speak, who are they really talking to? Their younger self? Their team? Their peers? People who underestimated them? Future hires? Look for who they referenced most in the transcript and who they seemed to be explaining themselves to.

> *[Capture here]*

### 6.4 How They Earn Trust
What's their instinctive trust-building behavior? In the transcript, how did they establish credibility with the interviewer — through competence, warmth, transparency, consistency, humor, or something else? Write the way they earn trust in real life.

> *[Capture here]*

### 6.5 What "Sounding Like Themselves" Means
If they read something written in their name and said "yes, this is me" — what would make it feel that way? Look for moments in the transcript where they described communication they admire, styles they reject, or how they know when something "feels right."

> *[Capture here]*

## Part 7: Content Strategy Translation

*This section bridges personality into actionable writing guidance.*

### 7.1 Content Pillars (Derived from Transcript)
Based on the themes that dominated the interview, these are the 3-5 recurring themes their content should rotate around:

1. **[Pillar Name]:** *[Brief description + why the transcript supports this as authentic]*
2. **[Pillar Name]:** *[Brief description + why the transcript supports this as authentic]*
3. **[Pillar Name]:** *[Brief description + why the transcript supports this as authentic]*
4. **[Pillar Name]:** *[Brief description + why the transcript supports this as authentic]*
5. **[Pillar Name]:** *[Brief description + why the transcript supports this as authentic]*

### 7.2 Voice Calibration Summary

| Dimension | Setting (1-10) | Transcript Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Formality** | (1 = casual texting → 10 = boardroom keynote) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Emotion** | (1 = cool analytical → 10 = openly passionate) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Vulnerability** | (1 = fully guarded → 10 = open book) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Humor** | (1 = never → 10 = constant presence) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Jargon** | (1 = plain language only → 10 = heavy insider language) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Sentence Length** | (1 = Twitter-punchy → 10 = academic-layered) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Directness** | (1 = circuitous/builds context → 10 = blunt lead with the point) | *[Why this number]* |
| **Abstraction** | (1 = always concrete/specific → 10 = conceptual/philosophical) | *[Why this number]* |

### 7.3 The Writing Litmus Test
Three questions to gut-check every draft before sending:

1. **Would they actually say this out loud?** If the language feels elevated beyond their natural register as observed in the transcript, strip it back.
2. **Does it pass the "[Name] Test"?** If you swap the byline to someone else and it still works, it's not specific enough to them.
3. **Does the emotional tone match?** Check the aftertaste (Part 4.7). If the piece leaves a different feeling than what they want to be known for, recalibrate.

### 7.4 Formatting Preferences
Based on their natural communication patterns in the transcript:

- **Preferred post length:** (Short / Medium / Long / Varies by topic)
- **Opening style:** (Story / Question / Bold statement / Observation / Data point)
- **Structure tendency:** (Narrative flow / Listicle / Problem→Insight / Before/After / Dialogue)
- **Closing style:** (Call to action / Open question / Punchline / Quiet reflection / Challenge)
- **Visual/formatting notes:** (Uses line breaks for pacing? Emojis? All caps for emphasis? Minimal formatting?)

### 7.5 Red Lines and Guardrails
Things to never do when writing for this person:

- **Tone violations:** *[What would feel fake — based on what they rejected or never used in the transcript]*
- **Topic boundaries:** *[What's off-limits or too personal — based on where they pulled back]*
- **Style dealbreakers:** *[Formatting or structures they hate]*
- **Audience missteps:** *[Who they'd never want to alienate or pander to]*

> *[Capture here with transcript quotes]*

### 8.4 Contradictions and Tensions Worth Exploring
Where did they contradict themselves, hold two opposing ideas, or express genuine tension in the transcript? These make the most honest, engaging content.

> *[Capture here — quote both sides of the contradiction]*

## Part 9: Inference Notes — What They Didn't Say

*This is where the ghostwriter earns their keep. What did you pick up between the lines of the transcript?*

**Processing note:** This section requires you to step back from extraction mode and into interpretation mode. Read the transcript holistically. What picture emerges when you connect all the dots?

### 9.1 Unspoken Needs
What do they seem to want from their content that they didn't articulate directly? (Recognition? Recruitment? Legacy? Processing their own ideas? Permission to be more themselves?) Look at the gap between what they said they want and where they had the most energy.

> *[Capture here]*

### 9.2 The Gap Between Who They Are and How They're Perceived
Where is there a disconnect between how they see themselves and how the world likely sees them? Content can close this gap deliberately.

> *[Capture here]*

### 9.3 Growth Edges
Where is their voice evolving? What are they becoming more comfortable with that they weren't before? Look for phrases like "I'm starting to..." or "I used to... but now..." in the transcript. Writing slightly ahead of this curve makes the content feel aspirational but authentic.

> *[Capture here]*

### 9.4 Emotional Undercurrents
What emotions were present but not named during the interview? Pride they downplayed? Frustration they intellectualized? Excitement they kept measured? Sadness they reframed? These are the textures that make writing feel human.

> *[Capture here]*

### 9.5 What the Transcript Didn't Cover
List the template sections where the transcript provided little or no material. These represent follow-up conversation priorities.

| Section | Gap Description | Suggested Follow-Up Question |
|---|---|---|
| *[Section #]* | *[What's missing]* | *[Question to ask next time]* |
| *[Section #]* | *[What's missing]* | *[Question to ask next time]* |
| *[Section #]* | *[What's missing]* | *[Question to ask next time]* |

### 9.6 The One-Line Summary
If you had to capture this person's voice in a single sentence — the thesis of who they are as a communicator — what would it be?

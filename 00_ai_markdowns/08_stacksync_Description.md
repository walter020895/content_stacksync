Stacksync Integration Cloud (Description)

The only integration cloud built for real-time, scale, and security.
Stacksync is an enterprise-grade integration platform and infrastructure designed to power mission-critical workflows at scale. We solve the data integration complexity that has plagued enterprises for decades—allowing teams to synchronize, automate, and orchestrate data across their entire technology ecosystem in real time, without managing infrastructure.

What We Do
Stacksync enables organizations to sync data bi-directionally between enterprise systems, databases, and data warehouses in real-time—not hours or minutes. Unlike legacy ETL tools that treat data integration as a batch process, Stacksync ensures your systems are always in perfect sync, enabling use cases that were previously impossible.
Our Core Promise
"Enterprise integration without the complexity."
We transform data integration from a maintenance burden into a competitive advantage. Whether you're connecting Salesforce to Snowflake, syncing NetSuite with Postgres, or orchestrating workflows across 200+ applications, Stacksync handles the plumbing so your teams can focus on innovation.

Key Messaging
The Marketing Angle
For Engineering Teams: "Treat your enterprise systems like a database—query and update them with SQL, without learning proprietary APIs."
For Data Teams: "Real-time, bi-directional sync between your warehouse and operational systems. No more stale data."
For RevOps: "Sync Salesforce to Snowflake before your screen refreshes. Empower your team with live data."
The Competitive Advantage
Unlike legacy ETL (Fivetran, Talend) that syncs every 5-15 minutes, or Reverse ETL tools (Hightouch, Census) that only push data one way, Stacksync keeps your entire ecosystem in real-time lock-step.

How It Works
Three Steps to Real-Time Sync
Connect → Link your apps via OAuth, SSH, or secure credentials (2 minutes)
Map → Select tables/objects and fields. Stacksync auto-detects custom fields (5 minutes)
Sync → Data flows bi-directionally in real-time. Issues are automatically managed and logged (instant)
No APIs. No infrastructure. No maintenance.

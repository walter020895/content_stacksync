- **Alexis** = technical architecture, code comparisons, builder lens, leadership vs. execution, orchestration
- **Nacho** = revenue math, operational constraints, pragmatic philosopher, anti-hype, speed + incentives
- **Carter** = educational, accessible, eager learner, DMs open, field translation from demos and calls
- **Brittany** = culture, invisible ops work, human stories, grace for failure, southern warmth, the backbone nobody talks about

- **Nacho**: "To be honest," / "Look." / "That's it."
- **Carter**: "Wait, it gets better." / "So I asked."

# How Technical Decision Makers Consume Content on LinkedIn

## Research compiled: 2026-02-25
## Target: VP of Engineering, CTOs, Engineering Managers, Senior Engineers at mid-market SaaS (100-1500 employees)

---

## 1. CONTENT CONSUMPTION HABITS

### How Often They're on LinkedIn
- LinkedIn has **1.3B+ total members**, but only **310M monthly active users** (24% of total base). The platform hosts **65 million decision-makers** and **10 million C-level executives**.
- Users check LinkedIn on average **7 times per week**.
- Average session duration ranges from **7.6 to 14.3 minutes** depending on measurement source. Most consistent figure: **~11 minutes per session** (Similarweb, June 2025).
- Daily engagement has climbed to **33 minutes per user on average**, a 12% year-over-year increase.
- **70% of all LinkedIn activity comes from mobile devices** in 2025.

### The Lurker Problem (Your Real Audience is Silent)
- The **90-9-1 rule** applies heavily: 90% of users only consume (lurkers), 9% occasionally engage, 1% create content.
- Only **4.9% of all LinkedIn users post anything**. Only **18% like or comment** on posts.
- Only **~3% of members post more than once per week**.
- Some researchers argue the real ratio is closer to **98-1.8-0.2** (even fewer creators).
- **~2 million posts, articles, and videos** are published on LinkedIn daily total across the platform.
- Implication: **Your technical decision-maker audience is overwhelmingly reading, not engaging.** Low visible engagement does not mean low readership. The silent majority IS the audience.

### When They Scroll
- **Peak engagement: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-11 AM and 12-2 PM** (local time).
- Early morning (8-10 AM): Users check LinkedIn before diving into work. Best for industry news and thought leadership.
- Lunch (12-2 PM): Quick scrolls during breaks. Best for polls, short posts, conversation starters.
- Afternoon (3-5 PM): Engagement spikes as people wind down. Best for case studies and reflective posts.
- Posts during peak windows receive **38% more engagement** and **44% higher reach** vs off-peak.
- **Weekend engagement drops significantly** across all studies.

### How Long They Spend on Content
- **54% of decision-makers** spend more than 1 hour per week reading/reviewing thought leadership content (Edelman-LinkedIn 2024).
- **54% of C-level executives** say they spend more time on thought leadership than before the pandemic.
- But there's a quality gap: **71% of decision-makers say half or less** of what they read gives them valuable insights.
- Users spend **15-20 seconds on carousel/document posts** vs **8-10 seconds on single-image or text-only**.

## 2. WHAT TECHNICAL LEADERS ENGAGE WITH

### Topics That Stop the Scroll
- **77% of decision-makers** prefer hearing from deep subject matter experts on specialized topics OVER senior executives speaking to high-level business issues (Edelman-LinkedIn).
- **81% of B2B decision-makers** want provocative insights that challenge their assumptions rather than validate current thinking.
- **80%** want thought leadership that includes 3rd-party data from trusted sources, not just proprietary insights.
- **91% of hidden decision-makers** (those not on the visible buying committee) value insights that help them uncover challenges or needs they hadn't recognized.
- Content with original insights, industry trends, or actionable advice gets the widest reach per the 2025 algorithm.
- **Posts about failures and lessons learned outperform success stories.** Example: a post about losing $15K generated 147 comments vs. 23 comments on a success story.

### What the Algorithm Rewards (2025)
- **Dwell time is now a critical ranking signal.** Posts people actually read (not just scroll past) get massive reach boosts. A well-written 1,300-character post outperforms a shallow 200-character hot take.
- LinkedIn rewards **focused, deep expertise** over broad, shallow content. The algorithm now identifies genuine subject matter experts.
- The **"golden hour"** (first 60-90 minutes) determines ~70% of a post's ultimate reach.
- Content delivering real expertise with concrete data points gets **3.7x more reach** than generalized content.
- **Thematically linked content** published in logical progression receives **62% more cumulative engagement** than the same content published randomly (CMI 2025).

## 3. WHAT THEY SHARE/REPOST

### Sharing Behavior
- **54% of posts receive zero reposts.** Sharing is rare and intentional.
- Video posts reportedly generate **20x more shares** than other formats (LinkedIn's own data -- this is likely inflated by platform incentive).
- Personal profiles generate **561% more reach** and **5x more engagement** than company pages sharing the same content.
- Decision-makers prefer content from real people. Thought leadership shared by **individuals is viewed as significantly more credible** than official brand communication (Edelman-LinkedIn).

### What They Put Their Name Behind
- **Content with original data or frameworks** that they can reference in conversations.
- Industry commentary that validates a position they already hold (or challenges it with evidence).
- Posts that make them look informed to their own network ("I shared this because it's exactly what we're seeing").
- Practical, actionable insights they can forward to their teams.
- **89% of B2B buyers** who found content on their own downloaded and consumed it; **72% shared it** with relevant team members (Demand Gen Report 2024).

## 4. WHAT THEY COMMENT ON

### Comment Triggers
- **Comments carry 15x more algorithmic weight** than likes (2026 data, Meet Lea analysis).
- Comments over **15 words carry 2.5x more weight** than shorter interactions.
- Replying to comments boosts post engagement by **~30%** (Buffer 2025).

### What Makes a Technical Leader Write a Comment
1. **Specific, detailed questions**: "We tried both strategies. Which has worked better for you in 2025?" works. Generic "Thoughts?" does not.
2. **Failure stories and hard lessons**: Posts about mistakes generate disproportionate comment engagement. Technical leaders relate and add their own experience.
3. **Provocative theses backed by evidence**: A clear position + data triggers agreement/disagreement. Both are comments.
4. **Industry hot takes with substance**: Not clickbait controversy -- real positions on tools, approaches, or trends the audience lives daily.
5. **Career/management stories**: Engineering challenges, team dynamics, technical decision-making under uncertainty.
6. **Tags/mentions of relevant people**: The use of tags is the most substantial predictor for both reactions and comments (academic study, Usera & Durham, 2025, SAGE Journals).

### What Does NOT Trigger Comments
- Generic engagement bait: "What do you think?" / "Comment YES if you agree!" -- LinkedIn actively detects and penalizes this.
- Humble brags disguised as advice.
- Posts that are clearly AI-generated with no personal angle.

---

## 5. WHAT THEY HATE/IGNORE

### Developer-Specific LinkedIn Frustrations (Codemotion, Hacker News, Stack Overflow)
- Only **12% of developers** use LinkedIn as a main source of technical information (Stack Overflow 2020).
- **33% of tech professionals** say excessive self-promotion is what annoys them most on LinkedIn (Jobvite 2019).
- **35% of LinkedIn connection requests** are followed by sales messages (Superhuman 2020).

### Content Patterns That Make Technical Audiences Cringe
1. **Humblebrags disguised as lessons**: "I didn't want to share this, but..." followed by a flex.
2. **Manufactured vulnerability**: Fake emotional stories designed for comments.
3. **Startup jargon that says nothing**: "We're disrupting the paradigm of cross-functional synergies."
4. **Algorithm-optimized formatting with no substance**: Posts that look like they were written to game the feed, not to communicate.
5. **Generic AI-generated content**: Over **53.7% of long LinkedIn posts** are now likely AI-generated (Originality.ai 2025 study of 3,368 posts). The flood makes human-written, specific content stand out more.
6. **Recruiter spam**: Generic messages, irrelevant tech mentions, copy-paste outreach.
7. **Job posts without salary information**: Tactical omissions breed distrust.
8. **Content that looks like Facebook**: Cute kitten videos, memes, personal non-professional content.
9. **Endorsement/anniversary prompts**: Platform-generated interactions that feel forced.
10. **Overly polished corporate content**: When engineers value precision, evidence, and substance, performative LinkedIn content feels fundamentally at odds with those values.

### What Gets Algorithmically Penalized (2025)
- Explicit calls to action like "What do you think?" = recognized as engagement bait.
- Tagging people who aren't relevant = flagged as spam.
- Every **external link reduces initial reach by ~30%**.
- Low-quality AI-generated content is increasingly detected and devalued.

## 6. FORMAT PREFERENCES

### Engagement Rates by Format (2025 Data)
| Format | Avg Engagement Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-image carousel | **6.60%** | Highest engagement. 15-20 sec dwell time. |
| Document/PDF carousel | **5.85-6.10%** | Second highest. 278% more than video. |
| Video (native) | **5.60%** | Most shared format. Usage up 69% YoY. |
| Text-only | **~4%** | Viable if writing is sharp, personal, insightful. |
| Polls | Highest impressions | But reach down 28%, becoming overused. |
| Single image | Lower than carousel | Beaten by multi-image across all page sizes. |

### Key Format Data Points
- Carousels earn **596% more engagement** than text-only posts (Buffer analysis).
- Carousels earn **303% more engagement** than single images.
- Carousels earn **278% more engagement** than videos.
- Carousel users spend **15-20 sec per post** vs 8-10 sec for text/single image.
- Video reach reportedly dropped **200% YoY** in one study, though other data shows usage up 69% and engagement up 20%. Mixed signals -- platform may be deprioritizing video in feed while promoting it in other surfaces.
- **50% of B2B buyers prefer video** over written content like whitepapers, but only 25% of B2B budgets go to video (Content Marketing Disconnect 2024).

### What Technical Audiences Specifically Prefer
- Developers want **searchable, skimmable content** -- not gated whitepapers.
- **86% of marketers prioritize whitepapers**, but only **27% of buyers** find them helpful vs. webinars, interactive content, case studies, infographics, and videos.
- Technical audiences prefer **specific feature integrations** ("Works with PostgreSQL") over broad claims ("AI-powered").
- **44% of developers use tools to learn**, not just ship faster -- positioning as learning partner works.

### Optimal Post Length
- Sweet spot: **1,300-1,600 characters** (~200-250 words), typically 30-45 seconds read time.
- Short punchy posts (150-300 characters) work for quick points and questions.
- Posts over 500 words get saved and referenced later -- ongoing engagement.
- The "dead zone" is the middle: not short enough to be punchy, not long enough to be meaningful.
- First **140 characters** are critical -- everything before the "See more" fold.
- For B2B/finance decision-makers: prefer longer (1,800-2,000 characters).

3. **Software comparison/review sites** = 55% of decision-makers rely on them.
4. **Industry analysts** (Gartner, Forrester) = deferred-to authority.
5. **Individual thought leaders** on social = growing influence (50%+ of younger buyers rely on external sources -- Forrester 2025 prediction).
6. **Vendor websites** = ranked second most useful (LinkedIn).
7. **Sales reps** = ranked seventh. **61% of B2B buyers now prefer a rep-free buying experience** (Gartner 2025 survey of 632 buyers).

### What Builds Trust vs. Destroys It
**Builds trust:**
- Named author with a clear point of view (67% prefer this over generic brand voice -- Edelman)
- 3rd-party data from trusted sources (80% want this)
- Deep subject matter expertise on specialized topics (77% prefer this)
- Specific, concrete examples and real numbers
- Acknowledging complexity and trade-offs
- Community support and searchable documentation (developer-specific)

**Destroys trust:**
- Generic corporate messaging
- Broad claims without evidence ("AI-powered" with no specifics)
- Content that feels like marketing dressed as thought leadership
- **71% of B2B marketers think they communicate a distinct brand position, but 68% of buyers say they don't** (Content Marketing Disconnect 2024)
- **51% of buyers in 2024** said content was too generic and irrelevant (up from 38% in 2023)
- **69% of B2B buyers** report inconsistencies between website info and what sellers say (Gartner 2025)

## 8. VOCABULARY AND TONE

### What Tone Resonates
- **64% of executives** prefer thought leadership with a **"more human, less formal tone of voice"** over an "even-toned, intellectual voice" (Edelman-LinkedIn).
- **67%** prefer content written by an **identifiable, named author** expressing their own point of view, not a generic brand voice.
- **87% of buyers** say thought leadership can be **both intellectually rigorous and fun to consume** at the same time.
- The winning formula: **authoritative + provocative + human**. Not: polished/corporate OR sloppy/casual. The sweet spot is "smart person talking directly to you."

### Developer-Specific Tone Preferences
- Developers value **precision, evidence, and substance**.
- Specific feature integrations ("Works with PostgreSQL," "Deploys via GitHub Actions") resonate more than broad claims ("AI-powered").
- **44% of developers** learn through tools -- content positioned as learning is trusted more than content positioned as selling.
- GitHub README templates, forum-friendly docs, and Stack Overflow-ready Q&A are the gold standard content formats for developer trust.
- Community-proven content > branded content.

### What Words/Approaches to Avoid
- Corporate jargon: "synergies," "paradigm shift," "leverage," "disruptive."
- Vague claims: "market-leading," "best-in-class," "cutting-edge."
- False urgency: "You need to do this NOW" without evidence.
- Condescending simplifications: Technical audience knows when you're dumbing things down.
- Over-personalized LinkedIn-speak: "Agree?" / "Let that sink in." / "Here's the thing."

## 9. THE BUYING COMMITTEE CONTEXT

### Why This Matters for LinkedIn Content
Technical decision-makers don't buy alone. The content they consume on LinkedIn influences group decisions.

- Average B2B buying committee: **8-13 stakeholders** depending on deal complexity (Gartner 2023, up from 6.8 in 2017 HBR).
- Each committee member enters with **4-5 pieces of independent research** they share with the group (Gartner).
- Buyers spend only **17% of total time meeting with suppliers**. Only **5-6% with any single vendor**.
- They spend **27% of time researching independently online** -- this is where LinkedIn content lives.
- **78% of B2B buyers consume 3+ pieces** of relevant content before talking to a salesperson (LinkedIn).
- **49% of buyers** say they rely MORE on content now than a year ago (LinkedIn).
- Over **40% of B2B deals stall** due to internal misalignment among hidden stakeholders (Edelman-LinkedIn 2025).
- **95% of hidden buyers** say strong thought leadership makes them more receptive to sales outreach.
- **79% of hidden buyers** are more likely to support proposals from vendors that regularly publish strong thought leadership.

## 10. ALGORITHM MECHANICS (Technical Detail for Content Strategy)

### How LinkedIn Decides What to Show (2025)
1. **Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR)**: LinkedIn embeds both users and posts in vector space. Content whose embedding is "close" to the user's embedding gets surfaced -- even without direct connection. Topical consistency matters.
2. **Engagement velocity**: First 60-120 minutes determine 70% of reach. Early comments (especially 5+ words) are the strongest signal.
3. **Dwell time**: How long someone spends reading your post. This is why well-written 1,300-character posts outperform shallow 200-character hot takes.
4. **Authority scoring**: Consistent posting on a specific topic builds algorithmic authority. LinkedIn rewards focused expertise over posting about everything.
5. **Signal hierarchy**:
   - Saves/reposts = strongest (1 save = 5x a like)
   - Comments = second strongest (15x more weight than likes)
   - Long comments (15+ words) = 2.5x more weight than short
   - Likes = weakest signal (confirms visibility, not interest)
6. **Penalties**: External links (-30% reach), engagement bait, irrelevant tags, low-quality AI content.
7. **Personal profiles vs company pages**: Personal profiles get **7-8% engagement** vs **1-2%** for company pages. Company page organic reach **dropped 60-66%** from 2024 to early 2026. Posts from personal profiles get **2.75x more impressions** than identical company page content.

## 11. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC BENCHMARKS

### Technology/SaaS on LinkedIn (2025)
- **Average engagement rate: 3.6%** (below platform average of 5.20%).
- **Median impressions per post: 4,240**.
- Lower engagement attributed to heavy reliance on automation and cold outreach.
- **74% of B2B buyers** use LinkedIn for work-related content (LinkedIn).
- **59% of B2B decision-makers** prefer creator content on LinkedIn over other platforms.

### AI Content Saturation
- **53.7% of long LinkedIn posts** are likely AI-generated (Originality.ai 2025).
- In sectors relying on public trust (healthcare, government), human-written posts see **40-44% better engagement**.
- In leadership/inspiration category, AI posts outperformed human by 75% -- but this is the most cringe-prone category for technical audiences.
- AI-generated content is becoming noise. Human-written, specific, experience-based content is becoming the differentiation signal.

## 12. SYNTHESIS: WHAT THIS MEANS FOR STACKSYNC CONTENT

### The Technical Decision-Maker Profile on LinkedIn
1. **They're there, but they're silent.** 95%+ of your technical audience never posts. They scroll, read, and occasionally click. Low engagement does not mean low readership.
2. **They check LinkedIn 7x/week, mostly on mobile, in 11-minute sessions.** You have seconds to earn their attention. The first 140 characters and the image are your entire pitch.
3. **They crave depth but have no patience for fluff.** 77% want deep expertise on specialized topics. 81% want to be challenged. But 71% say most thought leadership is garbage.
4. **They trust people, not brands.** Personal profiles get 5x the engagement. Named authors with clear POVs get 67% preference. Company pages are dying.
5. **They share content that makes them look smart.** The repost test: "Would sharing this make me look informed to my network?" If yes, they'll put their name on it.
6. **They comment when you challenge their thinking with specifics.** Not "Thoughts?" but "We tried X and it failed because Y. What's your experience?" Failure stories, concrete data, and specific frameworks trigger comments.
7. **They hate marketing disguised as thought leadership.** 51% say content is too generic. 68% say brands don't communicate a distinct position. The bar is rising.
8. **Carousel/document posts are the dominant format.** 6.6% engagement vs 4% for text-only. 15-20 sec dwell time vs 8-10 sec. But only if the carousel has real substance -- not styled text boxes.
9. **The algorithm rewards consistency and depth.** Topical authority is built over time. Thematically linked content gets 62% more engagement. One-off viral posts don't build algorithmic authority.
10. **61% of B2B buyers prefer a rep-free experience.** Content IS the sales process. 78% consume 3+ pieces before talking to anyone. Your LinkedIn posts are part of the buying journey whether you intend them to be or not.

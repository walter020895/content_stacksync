# Add-ons: AI Punctuation + Human Writing

## J) AI Punctuation / Typography Tells (High AI Signal)

101. Em dash overload: “—” in every other sentence.
102. “Not X — but Y” used as a default template marker.
103. Arrow bullets to fake structure: “→” “=>” “➡️”.
104. Colon staging spam: “Here’s the thing:” “The truth:” “Key point:”.
105. Too many lines ending in “…” for suspense.
106. Random micro line breaks every 2–4 words (template rhythm).
107. “:” used to introduce obvious statements (“Reason: because…”).
108. Parentheses used as a whisper too often: “(and here’s why)”.
109. Triple punctuation: “???” “!!!” or “…” + “!” combos.
110. ALL CAPS emphasis for normal words (reads performative).
111. Quote marks around “insight words” (“alignment” “truth” “leverage”).
112. Emoji-as-bullets in a perfect repeating pattern (too clean).
113. Symmetry formatting: 3–5 lines with identical cadence/punctuation.
114. Slash stacking: “speed/scale/impact” “focus/clarity/velocity”.
115. Buzz-hyphen spam: “high-signal, low-friction, founder-led”.
116. Over-clean numbered lists with identical sentence lengths.
117. Ellipses to manufacture depth without adding content.
118. Em dash used as dramatic pause mid-sentence constantly.
119. Semicolons used to “sound smart” without necessity.
120. “TL;DR:” followed by a generic summary.

**Rule of thumb:** Humans use punctuation for meaning. AI uses punctuation for formatting.

## K) How to Sound More Human (Without “Be Authentic”)

Use these knobs. Pick 2–4 per post.

### 1) Add real-world friction
Mention the annoying detail that made it hard.
- “We lost 3 hours because the CSV used the wrong delimiter.”
- “I rewrote the hook 4 times because it sounded salesy.”

### 2) One claim + one proof
Don’t stack 10 claims. Make one point and back it up.
- Claim: “Our onboarding was broken.”
- Proof: “40% of users never reached step 3.”

### 3) Use your nouns (specific objects)
Replace abstract words with tangible stuff.
- “doc / screenshot / call / contract / pipeline stage / Slack thread / demo”
Not:
- “strategy / alignment / landscape / synergy”

### 4) Write like you talk (but edited)
Keep 1–2 human markers per post. Not every paragraph.
- “Here’s what I didn’t expect…”
- “This part was annoying, but useful…”

### 5) Slightly imperfect structure (on purpose)
A tiny detour reads human.
- Short aside
- Quick correction: “No—actually, let me rephrase.”

### 6) Opinion with boundaries
Humans add limits; AI sounds universally correct.
- “In my case…”
- “This applies if you’re selling B2B and your cycle looks like X.”
- “I might be biased because…”

### 7) One micro-story beats 10 takeaways
Use:
- Setting (where/when)
- Friction (what went wrong)
- Decision (what you did)
- Result (what changed)

### 8) Reduce “performance punctuation”
Cut down:
- arrows, em dashes, suspense dots, “The lesson?” lines  
Use:
- short sentences + normal commas

## L) Quick Swaps (AI → Human)

- “Here’s why it matters” → “This is what changed my mind: ___”
- “Here’s the takeaway” → “If you take one thing from this: ___”
- “Let that sink in” → *(delete)* or add a concrete example instead
- “Not X. Y.” → “I used to think X. Then I saw Y.”

## M) Mini Checklist Before Posting

- [ ] Does each paragraph include a **real detail** (number, object, moment, constraint)?
- [ ] Did I remove at least **one** template line (“Here’s the takeaway”, “The truth”, etc.)?
- [ ] Did I keep punctuation **natural** (not arrows/dashes everywhere)?
- [ ] Is there one clear **claim** and one **proof**?
- [ ] Would a coworker recognize this as **my voice** if my name was removed?

# New Post Ideas — Research-Driven (Feb 2026)

15 ideas (3 per persona) designed to fix the gaps found in the draft review + reach research.

**Gaps these ideas address:**
- Zero Experimenter hooks → 5 of 15 are Experimenter (highest-performing hook for Nacho: 548 avg)
- 100% text-only → 7 of 15 are carousel-native (2-3x dwell time)
- Topic saturation (AI/data, e-commerce) → 13 of 15 are fresh angles
- No Lane 3 posts → 4 of 15 are Lane 3 (product proof)
- "That's it." closers → all 15 end with comment-generating questions (thread depth = Depth Score)
- No debate/question closers → every idea includes one

---

## NACHO — 3 Ideas

### N1. "I asked 15 CTOs the same question. The answers were always the same."
**The question:** "What would your team ship this quarter if they weren't maintaining integrations?"

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The real cost of integration maintenance is the product roadmap that never ships |
| Angle | Operator who asked the same question 15 times and keeps hearing the same answer |
| Hook Type | **Experimenter** (Nacho's #1 performer: 548 avg engagement) |
| Story Structure | Experiment setup → Pattern in answers → What it actually costs → The binary |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — maps to "30-50% engineering time" from ICP doc |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — 6-8 slides |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition (every CTO has this backlog), Tribal Identity |
| Closer | "What's on your roadmap that keeps getting bumped for maintenance?" |

**Why this works (research-backed):**
- Experimenter hook (missing from all 27 drafts, highest Nacho performer)
- Carousel = 2-3x dwell time vs text
- Question closer drives comment threads (Depth Score)
- ICP self-identification: CTOs reading this ARE the person with the delayed roadmap
- No product mention (market story > product pitch: 45 avg vs 5 avg)

**Carousel structure:**
- Slide 1: "I asked 15 CTOs the same question." (hook card, dark bg, large text)
- Slide 2: The question: "What would your team ship if they weren't maintaining integrations?"
- Slide 3-5: Top 3 answer patterns (each slide = one answer category)
- Slide 6: "Every answer was a feature their roadmap promised 2+ quarters ago."
- Slide 7: The binary: "The $75K isn't the cost. The cost is the product you're not building."
- Slide 8: "What's on your roadmap that keeps getting bumped?" (CTA)

### N2. "Salesforce just bought its fourth data company. Nobody is talking about what that admits."
**Salesforce acquisition empire:** MuleSoft ($6.5B), Tableau ($15.7B), Slack ($27.7B), Informatica ($8B) = $58B spent buying every data layer that feeds the CRM.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Salesforce keeps buying the data layer because the CRM was never supposed to be the database |
| Angle | Operator reading the acquisition pattern: the CRM admits it can't be the source of truth |
| Hook Type | **Investigator** (2% of top posts, rare = differentiated) |
| Story Structure | Evidence (4 acquisitions) → What they reveal → The admission → Rule |
| Lane | **Lane 1 (Reach)** — broad category narrative with ICP bridge |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — acquisition timeline |
| Psych Triggers | Pattern Recognition (4 data points = undeniable), Insider Knowledge |
| Closer | "What's the next data company Salesforce buys? And what does that tell you about the CRM?" |

**Why this works:**
- Fresh topic (not in any of the 27 drafts)
- Every ICP company uses Salesforce — instant recognition
- The thesis ("CRM was never the database") maps directly to Stacksync's value prop
- No product mention, but every reader draws the connection
- Carousel: 4 acquisitions = 4 reveal slides + intro + thesis

**Carousel structure:**
- Slide 1: "Salesforce spent $58B on four companies. Same thesis every time." (hook)
- Slide 2: MuleSoft ($6.5B, 2018) — bought the API layer
- Slide 3: Tableau ($15.7B, 2019) — bought the analytics layer
- Slide 4: Slack ($27.7B, 2021) — bought the communication layer
- Slide 5: Informatica ($8B, 2025) — bought the data infrastructure layer
- Slide 6: "They keep buying the layers around the CRM because the CRM can't be all of them."
- Slide 7: "The CRM was always the interface. Never the database."
- Slide 8: Closer question

---

### N3. "How your integration vendor prices tells you everything about their incentives."
**The pricing model that punishes growth:** task-based (Workato, Zapier) vs record-based (transparent, predictable).

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Integration pricing models reveal whether the vendor profits from your growth or your complexity |
| Angle | Revenue math operator breaking down the incentive structure behind pricing |
| Hook Type | **Contrarian** — challenges "just pick the cheapest plan" |
| Story Structure | Setup (pricing seems boring) → 3 models compared → What each incentivizes → Rule |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — maps to ICP: "transparent, predictable pricing based on records, not tasks" |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — comparison table across slides |
| Psych Triggers | Outrage (you're being charged for growing), Self-Interest |
| Closer | "How does your current integration vendor price? Per task, per record, or 'call us'?" |

**Why this works:**
- Revenue math = Nacho's core pillar
- Pricing is a topic zero current drafts cover
- ICP differentiator: Stacksync's pricing model is explicitly called out in the ICP doc as a competitive advantage
- Carousel comparison format = high dwell time (readers compare their own vendor)
- The question closer generates debate (everyone has a pricing opinion)

## RUBEN — 3 Ideas

### R1. "The 3 conversations that happen before every company fixes their data layer."
**The pattern:** Conversation 1: "It mostly works" (CTO). Conversation 2: "Why is this number different?" (CFO). Conversation 3: "We lost a customer because of stale data" (VP Sales). The third one always triggers the fix.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | There's a predictable 3-conversation arc before companies prioritize data infrastructure |
| Angle | Founder who's sat in 40+ of these conversations and can now predict the timeline |
| Hook Type | **Fortune Teller** — "I can predict when a company will fix this" |
| Story Structure | Pattern setup → 3 conversations (ascending urgency) → Why #3 always wins → Conviction |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — cross-functional data pain |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — 3 conversations = 3 slides |
| Psych Triggers | Pattern Recognition, Tribal Identity (CFOs/CTOs will self-identify) |
| Closer | "Which conversation is happening at your company right now?" |

**Why this works:**
- Insider-access format (Gergely Orosz template — works well for Ruben)
- Each conversation maps to a different ICP buyer persona (CTO, CFO, VP Sales)
- The question closer forces self-placement = high comment rate
- Builds on `cto_pattern_integration` but is differentiated (3 roles, not just CTO quotes)
- Carousel: each conversation gets its own slide with the quote + what it means

### R2. "Every Y Combinator batch has 5 integration startups. Here's why most die."
**The moat isn't the connector:** it's conflict resolution, schema drift handling, rate limit management, and 2am reliability.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The integration space looks easy to enter but the moat is invisible infrastructure, not connectors |
| Angle | Founder from YC W24 who watched other integration startups and knows what kills them |
| Hook Type | **Teacher** — founder sharing hard-won knowledge |
| Story Structure | Setup (easy to start) → What they build first → What kills them → What survives → Conviction |
| Lane | **Lane 1 (Reach)** — startup/YC audience + ICP bridge |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — founder conviction post, personal voice carries it |
| Psych Triggers | Authority (YC insider), Curiosity Gap (what kills them?) |
| Closer | "If you've built integration infrastructure, what was the hardest problem nobody warned you about?" |

**Why this works:**
- Positions Stacksync credibility (YC W24) without product pitching
- Technical audience (engineers evaluating build-vs-buy) gets insider knowledge
- Fresh topic — no YC/startup-ecosystem posts in any draft
- Text-only is correct here: founder conviction voice, personal observation

---

### R3. "We track one metric that most SaaS companies don't: time-to-forget."
**The metric:** how long after implementation before the customer stops thinking about the data layer entirely. The goal is invisibility.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The real product metric for infrastructure isn't usage — it's when users forget you exist |
| Angle | Founder defining a counterintuitive success metric that reveals the product philosophy |
| Hook Type | **Experimenter** — "we track X, here's what we found" |
| Story Structure | Metric reveal → Why it's counterintuitive → What it measures → What we've learned → Conviction |
| Lane | **Lane 3 (Product Proof)** — reveals product philosophy through a real metric |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — philosophical founder post |
| Psych Triggers | Curiosity Gap (what metric?), Cognitive Dissonance (success = being forgotten?) |
| Closer | "What's the most counterintuitive metric your company tracks?" |

**Why this works:**
- Experimenter hook (missing from all drafts)
- Connects to the `sync_infrastructure_bet` thesis ("invisibility at scale") but through a concrete metric
- No product pitch, but the metric IS the product story
- Generates debate: founders love discussing unusual metrics
- Ties directly to ICP promise: "you will never think about this again"

## ALEXIS — 3 Ideas

### A1. "I replaced our Salesforce API calls with SQL queries. Here's what happened to deploy time."
**Before/after:** proprietary SDK + test environment mismatch + deploy anxiety → SQL in CI/CD pipeline + standard branching + same workflow as every other service. Deploy time: hours → minutes.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Switching from CRM API to SQL-first workflow transformed deploy speed and developer happiness |
| Angle | CTO showing the before/after of a specific technical decision |
| Hook Type | **Experimenter** — "here's what happened when we changed X" |
| Story Structure | Before state → The change → After state → Why it worked → What it means |
| Lane | **Lane 3 (Product Proof)** — developer workflow preservation |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — before/after code comparison slides |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition (every engineer knows SDK hell), Validation |
| Closer | "What's your current workflow for deploying CRM changes? SDK, API, or something else?" |

**Why this works:**
- Experimenter hook (0 of 27 drafts use it)
- Carousel with code snippets = very high dwell time for engineers (they read every line)
- Maps directly to ICP: "developer workflow preservation", "SQL-first approach", "CI/CD pipelines"
- The before/after is visceral for any engineer who's dealt with CRM SDKs
- Lane 3: this is product proof without being a product pitch

**Carousel structure:**
- Slide 1: "I replaced Salesforce API calls with SQL queries." (hook)
- Slide 2: BEFORE — SDK code snippet, test environment diagram, deploy checklist
- Slide 3: The friction points (proprietary SDK, no branching, test ≠ prod)
- Slide 4: AFTER — SQL query, standard CI/CD, same branching as everything else
- Slide 5: The numbers (deploy time, test coverage, developer satisfaction)
- Slide 6: "The code wasn't better. The workflow was normal." (thesis)
- Slide 7: Closer question

### A2. "5 questions your integration vendor can't answer in the demo"
**The 5:** (1) What happens when both systems update the same record at the same second? (2) Show me the error handling at 3am under load. (3) What's the actual latency, not on an empty demo account? (4) How does pricing change at 10x my current volume? (5) What's your real uptime last 90 days — not the SLA, the actual number?

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The due diligence questions that separate infrastructure from features |
| Angle | CTO who evaluates tools the way an engineer evaluates code — by testing edge cases |
| Hook Type | **Investigator** — "here's what they won't show you" |
| Story Structure | Setup (demos are designed to impress) → 5 questions → Why each matters → Rule |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — sophisticated buyer evaluating alternatives |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — 5 questions = 5 slides |
| Psych Triggers | Insider Knowledge, Self-Interest (save yourself from a bad vendor) |
| Closer | "What's the first question you ask integration vendors that they can't answer?" |

**Why this works:**
- CAROUSEL-NATIVE: 5 questions = 5 slides with explanation
- ICP is explicitly described as "sophisticated buyer, often a second mover" evaluating alternatives
- Each question maps to a Stacksync strength (conflict resolution, error handling, latency, pricing, uptime)
- The question closer generates a goldmine thread (every CTO has a vendor horror story)
- Extremely high dwell time: readers will screenshot and save these questions

---

### A3. "The schema change that took down our sync for 3 days"
**The story:** A CRM vendor changes a field type without warning. The custom sync script breaks. 72 hours to diagnose, patch, test, redeploy. Then Alexis built a schema drift detection layer. Now it's automatic.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Schema drift is the silent killer of custom integrations — and it's preventable |
| Angle | CTO telling a war story that every engineer with a custom sync has lived |
| Hook Type | **Teacher** — hard-earned lesson from a specific failure |
| Story Structure | Incident → Scramble → Root cause → What we built → What it means |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — maps to "brittle, custom-coded integrations" |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — war story needs voice, not slides |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition (every engineer has a schema drift story), Fear (it will happen again) |
| Closer | "Has a CRM schema change ever broken your integration? How long was the fix?" |

**Why this works:**
- War story format = high dwell time (readers want to know how it ends)
- Schema drift is a specific, technical ICP pain that zero current drafts address
- Text-only is correct: the story needs Alexis's voice, not a carousel
- The closer generates war story threads (engineers love sharing horror stories)
- Positions Alexis as someone who's been in the trenches, not just an executive

## CARTER — 3 Ideas

### C1. "I mapped every question from 50 demos. The same 3 keep coming up."
**The 3 questions:** (1) "What happens when both systems update the same record?" (conflict resolution). (2) "How do you handle rate limits?" (API throttling). (3) "Can my engineers use SQL instead of your SDK?" (developer experience).

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The 3 questions every prospect asks reveal the 3 problems every integration user has |
| Angle | Carter as field translator — mapping demo conversations to universal pain patterns |
| Hook Type | **Experimenter** — "I tracked X, here's the pattern" |
| Story Structure | Setup (50 demos) → The 3 questions → What each really means → Why they keep asking |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — maps to all 3 primary ICP pain points simultaneously |
| Visual Format | **CAROUSEL (PDF)** — 3 questions = 3 slides |
| Psych Triggers | Validation (your question = everyone's question), Recognition |
| Closer | "If you've evaluated integration tools, what's the first question you ask?" |

**Why this works:**
- Experimenter hook (0 of 27 drafts, Carter's fresh angle on it)
- CAROUSEL: 3 questions × (what they ask + what it means) = 6+ content slides
- Each question maps to a specific Stacksync differentiator (conflict resolution, rate limits, SQL-first)
- Carter's "field translator" role makes this feel authentic, not salesy
- The closer generates a thread of real prospect questions (market intelligence for free)

---

### C2. "The gap between what CTOs say in the first call vs. the third call."
**First call:** "We have a sync, it mostly works." **Third call:** "Actually, two engineers spend 40% of their time on it."

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The normalization of integration pain — people don't realize how bad it is until someone asks the right questions |
| Angle | Carter as curious observer who keeps seeing the same gap between initial and deeper conversations |
| Hook Type | **Investigator** — revealing a hidden pattern in buyer behavior |
| Story Structure | First call reality → Third call reality → The gap → Why it exists → What it means |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — maps to "unsustainable integration maintenance burden" |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — Carter's conversational voice carries this |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition (every buyer has understated a problem), Curiosity Gap |
| Closer | "What's the biggest gap you've seen between first-call answers and what's actually happening?" |

**Why this works:**
- Fresh angle nobody is doing: the psychology of buying, from the SDR perspective
- Honest, humble Carter voice — not lecturing, just observing
- CTOs reading this will recognize themselves (powerful ego bait)
- Text-only: conversational observation, the voice is the format
- The closer invites stories from salespeople AND buyers (dual audience)

---

### C3. "The fastest demo I ever ran was 4 minutes. They signed the next week."
**The story:** Prospect had been evaluating tools for 6 months. Complex requirements doc. Then Carter showed Postgres-to-Salesforce sync live. 4 minutes. The requirements doc didn't matter anymore.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Product simplicity as the ultimate sales tool — the demo that sold itself |
| Angle | Carter's real-world demo story that demonstrates Stacksync's "minutes to first sync" promise |
| Hook Type | **Magician** — dramatic number (4 minutes) + surprising outcome |
| Story Structure | Setup (6-month evaluation) → Demo (4 minutes) → Reaction → What it means |
| Lane | **Lane 3 (Product Proof)** — "minutes to first sync; days to full implementation" |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — story-driven, Carter's energy carries it |
| Psych Triggers | Curiosity Gap (how did 4 min beat 6 months?), Social Proof |
| Closer | "What's the fastest you've ever gone from demo to decision on a tool?" |

**Why this works:**
- Product proof without being a product pitch — the story IS the proof
- "4 minutes" is a Magician hook scroll-stopper
- Maps to ICP: "implementation speed: minutes to first sync"
- Carter's eager energy makes this feel authentic, not salesy
- Closer generates demo/sales stories from the audience (high engagement topic)

## BRITTANY — 3 Ideas

### B1. "I automated our month-end close from 5 days to same-day. The spreadsheets didn't go away."
**The misconception:** automation replaces the work. Reality: it replaces the waiting. The data was always there. It just took 5 days to reconcile across systems.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | Month-end close speed is a data sync problem, not a people problem |
| Angle | Ops leader who fixed the close by fixing the data flow, not by working harder |
| Hook Type | **Experimenter** — "I changed X, here's what happened" |
| Story Structure | Before (5 days, the waiting) → What she changed → After (same-day) → The surprise (spreadsheets stayed) → Why |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain) + Lane 3** — operational data sync, product proof |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — Brittany's warm voice on a practical win |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition (every ops person knows the 5-day close), Validation |
| Closer | "How many days is your current month-end close? What's the bottleneck?" |

**Why this works:**
- Brittany's ONLY post that directly connects to Stacksync's ICP value
- Experimenter hook (missing from all drafts, fresh for Brittany)
- Ops/finance audience will self-identify immediately
- The "spreadsheets didn't go away" twist is genuinely surprising and earnable
- Closer generates specific operational answers (high-quality ICP comments)
- Bridges Brittany from pure Lane 1 (culture) into Lane 2 (ICP pain)

---

### B2. "The compliance audit nobody warns you about at a startup."
**The story:** SOC 2. The first time someone says your 15-person startup needs it. You Google it. You realize it touches every system, every process, every person. Nobody in engineering wants to own it. Operations owns it because operations always owns what nobody else wants.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | SOC 2 as the invisible ops achievement that unlocks enterprise deals |
| Angle | The ops person who owned the audit because nobody else would — and it became the company's biggest unlock |
| Hook Type | **Teacher** — sharing a hard-earned lesson |
| Story Structure | The moment (someone says "SOC 2") → The reality → Who owns it → What it unlocks → Why it matters |
| Lane | **Lane 2 (ICP Pain)** — maps to ICP: "SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001" |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — Brittany storytelling voice |
| Psych Triggers | Tribal Identity (ops people who've owned audits), Validation |
| Closer | "What was the hardest part of your first SOC 2 audit?" |

**Why this works:**
- Compliance is a PREREQUISITE for the ICP (explicitly in ICP doc) — but nobody talks about it on LinkedIn
- Brittany is the natural owner (she literally runs SOC 2 at Stacksync)
- Fresh topic: zero compliance posts in any draft
- The closer generates war stories (high dwell threads)
- Bridges Brittany's personal brand to enterprise buyers who need these certs

---

### B3. "The hire that changed how I think about teams wasn't the most talented person in the room."
**The story:** Someone who wasn't the fastest, most technical, or most experienced. But they had one thing: they made every meeting shorter, every handoff cleaner, every problem smaller. The multiplier hire.

| Lego | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Topic | The multiplier hire — the person who makes everyone around them faster |
| Angle | Ops leader who's built teams and knows the signal most hiring processes miss |
| Hook Type | **Contrarian** — challenges "hire the best talent" default |
| Story Structure | Setup (not the most talented) → What they did differently → The effect on the team → The principle |
| Lane | **Lane 1 (Reach)** — broad leadership appeal |
| Visual Format | **Text-only** — personal conviction, voice carries it |
| Psych Triggers | Recognition (everyone knows this person), Tribal Identity (the multiplier feels seen) |
| Closer | "Who's the person on your team that makes everyone else better? What do they actually do?" |

**Why this works:**
- Complements `grace_for_failure` (hiring theme) but different angle
- Broad reach potential (every leader recognizes the multiplier)
- Brittany's warm observation voice is perfect for this
- The closer generates specific team stories = deep threads
- High share potential: multipliers will share it, managers will tag their multipliers

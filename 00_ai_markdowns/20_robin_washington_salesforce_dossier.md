# BIOGRAPHICAL DOSSIER: Robin Washington (Salesforce COFO) & The 1-1-1 Model

> **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: The Salesforce CFO/COFO is **Robin Washington**, not Laura Miller. There is no Laura Miller in Salesforce's C-suite. Washington holds the newly created title of President and Chief Operating and Financial Officer (COFO) — a role that merges CFO + COO. Appointed February 2025, effective March 21, 2025.

## 1. ROBIN WASHINGTON — THE HUMAN STORY

### The Inflection Point: English Major to Fortune 500 Finance Leader

Robin L. Washington was born on September 22, 1962, in **Lincoln Park, Michigan** — a blue-collar suburb of Detroit. She entered the University of Michigan planning to study **English as a pre-law major**. Somewhere during undergrad, she pivoted to accounting and finance. That switch became her defining philosophy: **"Get comfortable being uncomfortable."**

She graduated with a B.B.A. in accounting and finance in 1984 from the University of Michigan. Later earned her MBA in strategy and finance from Pepperdine University in 1995.

### Career Arc

| Period | Role | Company |
|--------|------|---------|
| Early career | Auditor | Deloitte & Touche |
| Early career | Role at | Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago |
| Mid-career | Role at | Tandem Computers |
| Mid-career | Chief Accounting Officer | PeopleSoft |
| 2006-2007 | CFO | Hyperion Solutions |
| 2008-2019 | EVP & CFO | **Gilead Sciences** ($30B biopharma) |
| 2013-2025 | Board Director (Lead Independent from 2022) | Salesforce |
| March 2025-present | **President & COFO** | **Salesforce** |

### The Gilead Years — Her Proving Ground

At Gilead Sciences, Washington oversaw global finance, facilities and operations, investor relations, and IT for 11 years. During her tenure:
- Named **#1 CFO in biotechnology** by Institutional Investor magazine (2016)
- Ranked **#6 among all S&P 500 CFOs** by the Wall Street Journal (2014)
- Named **"Financial Woman of the Year"** by Financial Women of San Francisco (2017)
- Named one of Black Enterprise's **"Most Powerful Women in Corporate America"**
- Won the **Bay Area CFO of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award**

At the 2017 Financial Woman of the Year ceremony, her husband Carl and daughter Kendyl introduced her in what attendees called a "tear-jerking and intimate" speech that revealed who Robin is beyond the C-suite: a passionate mother, wife, friend, quiet philanthropist, and dynamic leader. She then delivered her "top ten lessons she would share with her 20, 30, and 40-something-year-old self" — David Letterman style.

### Family

Robin and her husband Carl Washington live in San Francisco. They have two children: **Ennis Washington** and **Kendyl Washington**.

### How She Got the Salesforce COFO Role

This is where the story gets interesting. Robin Washington had been on Salesforce's board since **2013** — over a decade. She chaired the audit committee. In 2022, she became Lead Independent Director. When CFO Amy Weaver announced she was stepping down in August 2024, Marc Benioff didn't go on a national search. He **looked around his own boardroom** and chose the person who had been his trusted strategic advisor for 12 years.

Fortune called her a "battle-tested finance and operations titan." Benioff said: *"Robin has been a trusted partner, advisor and a key architect of our strategy... Her operational mastery, financial expertise, and strategic vision make her the perfect leader to guide Salesforce through this transformational shift."*

The COFO title itself is new — a signal that Salesforce sees finance and operations as inseparable in the AI era.

**The Amy Weaver exit is its own story**: Weaver didn't leave for a competitor. She became **CEO of Direct Relief** — the **fifth largest nonprofit in the United States** — an organization that distributed $1.8 billion in medicine and supplies globally in fiscal 2023. A Salesforce CFO leaving to run one of America's biggest charities. The philanthropy DNA runs deep.

### Leadership Philosophy — Key Quotes

- *"Get comfortable being uncomfortable."* (personal motto)
- *"Without failure, there is no growth."*
- *"Leadership is often a matter of learning how to influence without authority."*
- *"All of you are going to have a seat at the table one day. That's a privilege; what are you going to do with it? How are you going to make the world better?"* (to Michigan students, 2022)
- *"I believe in the 80/20 rule: we have so much overlap and so much commonality, and a lot of times we focus on our differences rather than commonality."*
- *"If a company truly embraces diversity they're going to grow, they're going to do better, and that means more opportunity for everybody."*

### Black Women on Boards — The Side Mission

In 2020, after George Floyd's murder, major American firms pledged to diversify their boards. Robin Washington and **Merline Saintil** (a tech executive) kept getting recruitment calls — but they were at capacity. Their realization: *"We know amazing Black women who just aren't getting the calls. Can we do something about that?"*

They organized a Zoom call with 18 Black women executives. That conversation became **Black Women on Boards (BWOB)**, a nonprofit. The insight: qualified Black women weren't getting calls not because they weren't qualified, but because **CEOs, board members, and search firms didn't know they existed.**

Today: 200+ members, 30+ women placed on public company boards. Only **4% of S&P 500 board seats** are held by Black women.

## 2. THE 1-1-1 MODEL — THE BIGGER STORY

### Origin: Day One, Before Revenue

In **1999**, Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Frank Dominguez, and Dave Moellenhoff started Salesforce in a **rented one-bedroom apartment** at 1449 Montgomery Street, San Francisco's Telegraph Hill. They called it "The Laboratory."

**On the same day they incorporated the company, Benioff also created the 1-1-1 model:**
- 1% of equity
- 1% of product
- 1% of employee time

This was before Salesforce had a single customer. Before a single dollar of revenue. Before any VC money (they raised $17M privately — no VC firms would invest). The philanthropy model was baked in at founding, not bolted on later.

### The Colin Powell Connection

The origin has a human backstory. While at Oracle, Benioff founded **Oracle's Promise** — a program to bring computers to schools across the US. Colin Powell called Benioff to pledge support for a middle school in Washington, D.C. That phone call started a mentorship.

Powell's philosophy — that **business cannot sit on the sidelines in the march for equality** and that **education is one of the best antidotes to inequality** — shaped Benioff's conviction that philanthropy and profit aren't trade-offs.

In 2014, Benioff invited Powell to join Salesforce's board of directors.

Benioff wrote in TIME magazine after Powell's death: *"Shortly after founding Salesforce in 1999, I was inspired by General Powell to include a new model of philanthropy as a fundamental part of the company."*

### The Numbers — Cumulative Impact (as of late 2025)

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Total grant funding | **$841 million+** |
| Employee volunteer hours | **10 million+** |
| Nonprofits using free/discounted Salesforce | **62,700+** |
| Free licenses per eligible nonprofit | **10 Salesforce licenses** |
| Annual VTO per employee | **56 hours (7 paid days)** |
| Employee volunteer participation | **50%** (vs. 15% industry average) |
| Companies in Pledge 1% movement | **19,000+ in 130+ countries** |
| Schools adopted globally | **120+ across 40+ cities, 12 countries** |
| School volunteer hours | **70,000+** |

### The Pledge 1% Movement — Beyond Salesforce

Pledge 1% was co-founded by Salesforce Foundation, **Atlassian**, Entrepreneurs Foundation of Colorado, and Rally. Early adopters: **Twilio, DocuSign, Glassdoor, Xactly, Zuora, 6sense, Planet Labs, Sage**.

In its first year: 500+ companies joined. Today: 19,000+ companies globally. Pledge 1% companies have collectively generated **$1 billion+ in value** (volunteer hours + product + funding). IPOs from Pledge 1% companies ignited **$250M+ in new philanthropy**.

### The Financial Tension — 1% of What?

Salesforce's market cap peaked at ~$320B in early 2025 (currently ~$177B in Feb 2026). The 1% equity commitment, made when the company was worth nothing, has scaled into staggering real-dollar philanthropy as Salesforce grew from a one-bedroom apartment to the world's largest CRM.

The model doesn't require a $3B annual check. The equity was set aside pre-IPO. As the stock grew, so did the philanthropic fund. The product donation (10 free licenses per nonprofit x 62,700 organizations) is real cost — but it's also the best possible sales pipeline. Many nonprofits that start free become paying customers as they grow.

The employee time component: 56 hours/year x ~76,000 employees = potential of ~4.3 million hours/year. At an average loaded cost of ~$100/hr, that's ~$430M in annual implied labor value. But employees who volunteer are more engaged, stay longer, and report higher satisfaction. **50% of Salesforce employees volunteer, vs. 15% at peer companies.**

## 3. PHILANTHROPY DEEP DIVE — WHERE THE MONEY GOES

### A. Education — The Biggest Bet

- $20M in 2023
- $25M in 2022
- $19M in 2021
- **$120M+ to public schools cumulatively** (per Benioff's TIME article)
- $13M specifically for STEM expansion + $17M for AI readiness nonprofits (2025)

### B. Healthcare — The Children's Hospital Story

Marc and Lynne Benioff's personal giving to UCSF Children's Hospitals:

| Year | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2010 | $100M | Build new Children's Hospital at Mission Bay |

- 150 UCSF pediatric specialists
- Specialized in sickle cell disease, pediatric cancer, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia
- Top Children's Hospital recognition by Leapfrog (8 consecutive years)

### C. The $1 Billion Milestone

In October 2025, Marc and Lynne Benioff announced that combined contributions from the Benioffs personally and Salesforce to the San Francisco Bay Area have **surpassed $1 billion** — one of the most significant philanthropic milestones in the region's history.

### D. Environment & Sustainability

- Salesforce achieved **net zero residual emissions** across its entire value chain (2021)
- Voluntarily reporting greenhouse gas emissions since fiscal year 2012
- **Sustainability declared a core company value** (alongside Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality)
- Built **Net Zero Cloud** (formerly Sustainability Cloud) — ESG management product for tracking Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions
- Targets: ~50% emissions reductions by 2030, near-zero by 2040
- **$10M in climate justice grants** in FY2024, supporting 18 organizations

### E. Employee Volunteering — Real Stories

**Tim Linquist** (Software Engineering Architect): Established a Makerspace at York Elementary in Evergreen Public Schools for underserved students. After two years, now expanding to all 22 elementary schools in the district.

**Frank** (ISV Technical Account Manager): During COVID-19, rallied family, friends, and colleagues for City Harvest. Campaign raised **$200K+ and provided 1 million+ meals** to food-insecure New Yorkers.

**Global school adoption**: Salesforce employees have adopted 120+ schools across 40+ cities and 12 countries, volunteering 70,000+ hours.

## 4. MICRO-DETAILS & QUOTES

### Robin Washington — Direct Quotes

**On earnings call preparation (Dreamforce 2025):**
*"AI has reduced my preparation time for earnings calls to hours instead of days."*

**On digital labor:**
*"The introduction of digital labor represents a decisive and strategic shift for CFOs. With AI agents, we're not merely transforming business models; we're fundamentally reshaping the entire scope of the CFO function."*

**On Agentforce progress:**
Salesforce reached 1 million agent conversations, with agents autonomously resolving 85% of all customer queries.

**On diversity:**
At Gilead, Washington established the **Women's Leadership Forum** for the CFO organization — helping female leaders develop skills and creating discussions with women throughout the broader business community.

### Marc Benioff — On Philanthropy

*"Shortly after founding Salesforce in 1999, I was inspired by General Powell to include a new model of philanthropy as a fundamental part of the company — pledging one percent of equity, product and time to communities."* (TIME, 2021)

*"Business could not sit on the sidelines in the march for equality."* (attributing to Powell's philosophy)

### The Culture Question — Is It Real?

**Evidence it's real:**
- 50% employee volunteer participation vs. 15% industry average
- The departing CFO (Amy Weaver) chose to lead the 5th largest US nonprofit, not a hedge fund
- $841M in actual grants disbursed — not pledged, disbursed
- 62,700 nonprofits using the product for free
- Employee stories are specific, named, verifiable (Tim Linquist, Frank at City Harvest)
- The model was embedded at founding, not added after an ESG PR crisis
- 56 hours VTO/year is among the highest in tech

**Evidence of tension:**
- Salesforce laid off ~10% of workforce in early 2023 while maintaining philanthropy budgets
- Stock dropped ~42% over a 12-month period (early 2025 to early 2026) — pressure on all discretionary spending
- The 1% equity was set aside pre-IPO; the ongoing cost is primarily product licenses and employee time, not cash off the P&L
- Some critics argue the free nonprofit licenses are a pipeline play, not pure charity

## 5. STACKSYNC CONNECTOR BRIDGE

**Double presence in Stacksync's ecosystem:**
1. **Salesforce CRM** — a Stacksync CRM connector. The CRM that 62,700+ nonprofits use for free.
2. **Heroku Postgres** — a Stacksync database connector. Heroku Connect syncs Salesforce data to Heroku Postgres bidirectionally.

**The thread**: The same CRM that Salesforce gives away to nonprofits is literally a product Stacksync connects to. And the database that powers Salesforce's own developer platform (Heroku Postgres) is another Stacksync connector. When a nonprofit runs Salesforce CRM with a Heroku Postgres backend, Stacksync can sync both sides.

**Additional context**: Heroku Connect is going away (this was already a Ruben post topic). Nonprofits running Salesforce + Heroku Postgres will need a new sync layer. Stacksync is positioned as that replacement.

## 6. POST ANGLES & EDITORIAL ANALYSIS

### 3 Potential Hook Angles

**Angle 1: "The apartment pledge"**
Marc Benioff committed 1% of his company to charity before he had a single customer. That apartment decision has now generated $841 million in grants and 10 million volunteer hours. What if every startup did this on day one?

**Angle 2: "The CFO who chose the children's hospital"**
Amy Weaver spent 11 years at Salesforce, helped the company climb 14 spots on the Fortune 500. When she left, she didn't go to a hedge fund. She became CEO of Direct Relief — the fifth largest charity in America. The successor, Robin Washington, co-founded a nonprofit to put more Black women on corporate boards. Salesforce doesn't just hire finance leaders. It creates philanthropists.

**Angle 3: "62,700 nonprofits pay $0"**
Salesforce gives 10 free licenses to every qualifying nonprofit. 62,700 organizations have taken them. That's not a discount program. That's the world's largest CRM deliberately choosing not to charge the organizations that need it most. The CFO's job is to make that math work.

### The Single Most Emotional Fact

At the 2017 Financial Woman of the Year ceremony, Robin Washington's husband Carl and daughter Kendyl introduced her — a "tear-jerking" speech revealing who she is beyond the boardroom. Then Robin stood up and delivered "ten lessons she would share with her 20, 30, and 40-something-year-old self." She started her college career as an English major wanting to be a lawyer. She became the #6 CFO in the entire S&P 500. Her motto: "Get comfortable being uncomfortable."

### The Single Most Surprising Fact

Salesforce's departing CFO Amy Weaver didn't take another corporate CFO job. She became **CEO of Direct Relief — the 5th largest charity in the U.S.**, which distributed **$1.8 billion in medicine and supplies** in a single year. Two consecutive Salesforce finance leaders — Weaver to philanthropy, Washington who co-founded Black Women on Boards — are both defined by purpose beyond profit.

### The "I Didn't Know That" Detail

Marc Benioff committed 1% of equity, product, and time to charity on the **same day** he incorporated Salesforce in 1999 — working out of a rented one-bedroom apartment on Telegraph Hill that they called "The Laboratory." No customers. No revenue. No VC funding. The philanthropy model wasn't a pledge made by a $300B company looking for good PR. It was four people in an apartment saying: "Before we make a dollar, we're going to give some of it away."

And it started because of a phone call. Colin Powell called Marc Benioff to support a middle school in Washington, D.C. That call became a mentorship. That mentorship became the 1-1-1 model. That model has now generated $841 million in grants, 10 million volunteer hours, and a movement of 19,000 companies in 130 countries.

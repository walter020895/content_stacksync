# TEASER 2: The Numbers

How many saved searches do you have running in NetSuite?

If you know your exact number, this post is for you.

If you've ever explained to finance why that report looks different than yesterday... this post is for you.

If you've built a workflow that actually works and documented it so nobody else breaks it... this post is for you.

Something's coming for the NetSuite crowd.

Tag your best NetSuite operator. The one who actually knows where the bodies are buried.

Tony B. 🤜

## Kallaway Analysis

**Hook type:** Teacher + Magician (question hook)
**3-step formula:**
- Context lean: Specific NetSuite detail (saved searches)
- Scroll stop: "If you know your exact number"
- Contra snap: "Where the bodies are buried"

**Desire mapped:** Status (recognition for deep knowledge)
**Tony voice markers:** Specific operational detail, "Tony B.", 🤜

## Image Concept

**Option A - The Question:**
```
How many saved searches
are running in your NetSuite?
```
Simple question, dark background, bold white text

**Option B - The Signal:**
```
If you know the answer,
this is for you.
```
Minimal, curiosity-driven

**Option C - Bodies buried:**
```
"Knows where the bodies are buried"
- every NetSuite team about that one person
```
Quote style, dark background

**Style:** Clean, specific, insider language
**Colors:** Dark with white/orange accent

## Why This Works for Tony

- Leads with specific detail (saved searches = insider signal)
- "If you know..." structure = qualification
- "Where the bodies are buried" = operator humor
- "Tony B." sign-off = his brand
- Numbers-adjacent (even if not his own numbers)

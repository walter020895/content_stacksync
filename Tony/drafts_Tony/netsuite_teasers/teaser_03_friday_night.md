# TEASER 3: Friday Night Fix

You ever get a call on a Friday night because a NetSuite workflow broke?

Not "I'm hearing about this secondhand."

You. Personally. Logged in. Fixed it.

Those people don't get enough credit.

The ones keeping the revenue flowing while everyone else is at happy hour.

I want to find them.

Tag your best NetSuite firefighter. The one who's fixed something nobody else could.

Let's talk. 🤜

## Kallaway Analysis

**Hook type:** Magician (shared pain = instant recognition)
**3-step formula:**
- Context lean: Friday night call, workflow broke
- Scroll stop: "You. Personally. Logged in. Fixed it."
- Contra snap: Recognition for the unsung heroes

**Desire mapped:** Status (finally getting credit)
**Tony voice markers:** "Let's talk.", short punchy fragments, 🤜

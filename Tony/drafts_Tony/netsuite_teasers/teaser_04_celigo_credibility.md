# TEASER 4: Celigo Background

3 years at Celigo.

I talked to hundreds of NetSuite teams. Controllers. Admins. RevOps leads. The people keeping operations running while everyone else built decks.

One pattern:

The best NetSuite operators aren't the most credentialed. They're the ones who've broken something, learned from it, and built a process so it never happens again.

I'm looking for those people.

Tag someone who actually operates in NetSuite. The person the team goes to when something doesn't make sense.

Tony B. #GRIND

## Kallaway Analysis

**Hook type:** Experimenter (I've seen this pattern)
**3-step formula:**
- Context lean: 3 years at Celigo, hundreds of conversations
- Scroll stop: "Built decks" vs "keeping operations running"
- Contra snap: Broke something → learned → built process

**Desire mapped:** Status (recognition for real operators)
**Tony voice markers:** Specific number (3 years, hundreds), "#GRIND", "Tony B."

## Why This Works for Tony

- Uses his actual Celigo experience (verified, authentic)
- "Hundreds of NetSuite teams" = specific, credible
- "Built decks" vs real work = his worldview
- Process-oriented (broke → learned → built)
- "#GRIND" + "Tony B." = his signature

# TEASER 2 (Superhero Version) - FINAL

Every company has one.

The person who knows how many saved searches are running.

The one who can explain why that report looks different than yesterday.

The one who built the workflow that actually works — and documented it so nobody else breaks it.

They don't wear capes.

They wear headphones at 9pm fixing something before month-end close.

I'm looking for them.

Tag the NetSuite operator you know. The one who actually keeps it running.

I want to connect.

Tony B. 🤜

## Alternative Versions

### Version B (More Direct):

Every company has a NetSuite superhero.

They don't wear capes. They wear headphones at 9pm.

Fixing workflows. Explaining reports. Keeping the close on track.

I'm looking for these people.

Help me find them.

Tag the best NetSuite operator you know. I want to connect with them.

### Version C (Shortest/Punchiest):

NetSuite superheroes don't wear capes.

They wear headphones at 9pm fixing workflows before month-end close.

I'm building something for them.

Help me find them. Tag the NetSuite operator who keeps your business running.

Let's talk. 🤜

### Version D (Most Intentional):

I'm looking for NetSuite operators.

Not consultants. Not advisors.

The ones who know how many saved searches are running. Who fix workflows at 9pm. Who keep the close on track while everyone else is offline.

They don't wear capes. But they should.

Help me find them.

Tag someone who actually runs NetSuite. I want to connect.

## Kallaway Analysis

**Hook type:** Teacher + Magician

- Contra snap: "I'm looking for them. Help me find them."

**Desire mapped:** Status (recognition) + Curiosity (why is he looking?)
**Tony voice markers:** "I'm looking for them", "I want to connect", direct CTA, "Tony B. 🤜"

## Why The Intentional CTA Works

- "I'm looking for them" = clear purpose
- "Help me find them" = involves the reader
- "Tag the NetSuite operator you know" = specific action
- "I want to connect" = human, not salesy
- Creates curiosity: why is Tony looking for these people?

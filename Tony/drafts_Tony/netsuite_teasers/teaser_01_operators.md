# TEASER 1: The Operators (Recommended)

NetSuite operators.

Not the consultants who talk about it.

The ones who run it. Scale it. Fix it when something breaks at 11pm on a Friday.

I spent years selling integration tools to this crowd. Celigo. iPaaS. The whole ecosystem.

One thing I learned: the best NetSuite operators don't have the loudest profiles. They're heads down. Building.

I want to find them.

Tag someone who actually runs NetSuite. Not advises on it. Runs it.

## Kallaway Analysis

**Hook type:** Magician + Contrarian
**3-step formula:**
- Context lean: "NetSuite operators"
- Scroll stop: "Not the consultants who talk about it"
- Contra snap: Best operators are heads down, not loud

**Desire mapped:** Status (recognition for real operators)
**Tony voice markers:** Short sentences, "heads down. Building.", "#GRIND 🤜"

## Image Concept

**Option A - Bold Text:**
```
NETSUITE OPERATORS
(not consultants)
```
Dark background, white bold text, clean typography

**Option B - Celigo credibility:**
```
Years selling to NetSuite operators.
Now I want to find them.
```
Minimal design, professional

**Option C - The split:**
```
LEFT: "Advises on NetSuite"
RIGHT: "Runs NetSuite at 11pm Friday"
```
Before/after style, RIGHT side highlighted

**Style:** Clean, no fluff, professional but direct
**Colors:** Dark background preferred (contrast with LinkedIn white)

## Why This Works for Tony

- Uses his Celigo credibility (iPaaS = NetSuite integration world)
- "Heads down. Building." = his values
- Short punchy lines = his voice
- "#GRIND" = his signature
- Separates talkers from doers = his worldview

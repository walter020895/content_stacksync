# TEASER 5: Midwest Operators

The best NetSuite operators aren't in San Francisco.

They're in Indianapolis. Columbus. Kansas City. Detroit.

Running operations for companies that ship real things to real customers.

Not getting the LinkedIn love. Just doing the work.

I'm one of them. I want to find more.

Tag a NetSuite operator who doesn't have 50K followers but keeps the business running.

Never. Forget. Where. Home. Is. 💜

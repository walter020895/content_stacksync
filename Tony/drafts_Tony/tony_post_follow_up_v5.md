20 years. Hundreds of deals. One pattern:

The reps who chase, lose.

"Just checking in!"
"Wanted to bump this up!"
"Any update?"

That's not follow-up. That's hope.

What works:

Set a timeline on the call.
Both sides agree: "On this date, we reconnect."

If they reschedule or don't show?

One question: "What's changed?"

That question does more than your entire email sequence.

It surfaces the real objection.
It shows mutual respect.
It separates live deals from dead ones.

Same with your data.

If your reps spend Monday mornings asking "which number is right?"—they're not selling. They're reconciling.

When CRM and database sync in real-time, the only question left is "What's changed?" with the customer.

Not with the spreadsheet.

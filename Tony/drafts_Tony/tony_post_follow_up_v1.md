I don't call prospects asking "Have you looked at it yet?"

That's chasing.
And chasing never closes.

What I do instead:

I set a timeline on the call. We both agree: "On this date, we'll meet again."

Now if they don't show or want to reschedule, I can ask one simple question:

"What's changed?"

That question does more work than ten follow-up emails.

It respects their time.
It respects mine.
And it reveals whether this deal is real or dead.

Same principle applies to your data.

If your reps are chasing down numbers every week because CRM and database don't match—you're not selling. You're reconciling.

Fix the system. Stop the chase.

Chasing kills deals.

I don't call prospects asking "Are you ready yet?"

I set a timeline on the call.
We both agree: "On this date, we meet again."

If they ghost or reschedule?

One question: "What's changed?"

That's it.

That question reveals what's real.
That question respects everyone's time.
That question closes.

You can't ask "what's changed?" if your own data is always behind.

If CRM says one thing and your database says another—you're guessing.

And guessing isn't selling.

Real-time data. Real conversations. Real pipeline.

Let's talk.

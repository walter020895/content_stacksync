# TONY B. — Heroku Connect: The Integration Tool Nobody Classified
## Angle: Contrarian reframe. HC was never called an iPaaS. It might have been the most important integration tool of the decade. Tony's Celigo background gives authority.

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Heroku Connect was never classified as an iPaaS. Not in any Gartner quadrant. Not alongside MuleSoft or Boomi or Workato.

It might have been the most important integration tool of the last decade.

### HOOK B

I spent years selling iPaaS at Celigo. Visual builders. API connectors. Workflow automation.

Heroku Connect used a Postgres table. No connectors. No middleware. It might have been better than all of them.

### HOOK C

iPaaS tools build connectors between systems. Heroku Connect eliminated the connector entirely.

Nobody gave it credit for that. Salesforce just ended sales for it. The idea is still right.

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

Heroku Connect was never classified as an iPaaS. Not in any Gartner quadrant. Not alongside MuleSoft or Boomi or Workato.

It might have been the most important integration tool of the last decade.


I spent years at Celigo. I know iPaaS. The visual builders. The workflow automation. The API-to-API middleware. The pricing. The maintenance tax.

iPaaS tools solve one problem: get data from System A to System B.

Heroku Connect solved the same problem. Differently.

No visual builder. No workflows. No middleware. Just your Salesforce data, replicated into a Postgres table. Query it with SQL. Write to it with SQL. Done.

iPaaS approach: configure a connector, map fields, build workflows, pay per transaction, maintain forever.

Heroku Connect approach: one Postgres table. SQL. Done.

Same outcome. Completely different playbook.

The iPaaS world builds connectors between systems. Heroku Connect eliminated the connector. Database-first.

The industry never gave it credit. Never classified it alongside the tools it was quietly outperforming.

On February 6, Salesforce ended new Heroku Enterprise sales. End of Sale.

The unclassified tool is gone. The iPaaS tools with ten times the complexity? Still selling. Still charging.

Heroku Connect had real problems. Locked to Heroku Postgres. Expensive. But the core idea was right: database as the integration layer. No middleware. Just SQL.

Every iPaaS I've worked with adds layers between you and your data. Heroku Connect removed them.

That approach didn't need a Gartner quadrant. It needed a better platform.

That's what we're building at Stacksync. The approach iPaaS never figured out.

If your Salesforce sync costs more than it should, let's talk. No pressure. Just math.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Tony. Short bursts. Fragments. Numbers. Confident without arrogance. Personal authority (Celigo background). Direct CTA. Signs "Tony B."
- **Ego bait**: iPaaS users realize there was a simpler way. HC users validated that they were on the right tool in the wrong category. Integration engineers feel understood.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**:
  - Single subject: HC as unrecognized integration tool vs iPaaS category
  - Single question: "How was it better than iPaaS? Why wasn't it classified?"
  - Angle front-loaded: "never classified as an iPaaS" in sentence 1 (the reframe)
  - Pattern: Impossible Stat variant (uncategorized tool → most important)
  - Emotional trigger: admiration (team never got credit) + contrarian reframe (better than the classified tools)
  - 3 sentences. Clean.
- **Traffic driver**: "iPaaS" + "Gartner" + "MuleSoft" + "Boomi" + "Workato" + "Heroku Connect" in hook. Catches integration professionals.
- **AI slop check**: No "here's the thing," no "game-changer," no "seamlessly," no "let that sink in." No em dashes. Replaced "That's not X. That's Y." (AI pattern #6) with Tony-voice fragment. Tony uses periods and fragments.
- **Word count**: ~270
- **Factual sources**: Heroku docs (SQL interface, bidirectional sync), Sequin (45 vs 4 lines), Stacksync blog (pricing, 60-70% cost reduction), SalesforceBen (Feb 6 End of Sale). Tony's Celigo background from persona docs.

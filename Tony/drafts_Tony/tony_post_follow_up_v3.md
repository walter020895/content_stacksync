Early in my career, I chased every deal.

"Just following up!"
"Did you get a chance to look?"
"Circling back on this..."

Ten emails. No response. Deal dies anyway.

Took me years to learn the fix.

Now I set the timeline on the first call.
We agree together: "This date, we meet again."

If they reschedule? I ask one question:

"What's changed?"

Not aggressive. Not passive.
Just clear.

That question surfaces what 10 follow-ups never will.

Real objection? I can handle it.
Deal dead? I move on.
Still interested? Now we have a real conversation.

Same logic applies to your data.

If you're "following up" with your own database because the CRM doesn't match reality—that's not selling. That's maintenance.

Fix the sync. Focus on the close.

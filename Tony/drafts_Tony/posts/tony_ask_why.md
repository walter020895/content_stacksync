Nine times out of ten, the deal comes down to the whys.

Not the what. Not the how. The why.

Why are we talking today?
Why is this a problem now?
Why hasn't this been solved before?
Why do you need to fix it?

Most reps ask surface questions. What system are you using? How many users? What's your budget?

Those are fine. But they don't tell you what's actually going on.

If a prospect is on a call with you, something is wrong. If they were happy, they wouldn't be talking to vendors.

Your job is to find out what that something is.

And usually, it's not what they say first.

"We need better reporting" might really mean "My CEO is asking questions I can't answer and it's making me look bad."

"We want to consolidate tools" might really mean "I'm spending 20 hours a week on manual work that's killing me."

You don't get there with "what" questions. You get there by asking why. And then asking why again.

Why is that a priority now?
Why hasn't the current system worked?
Why does this matter to you personally?

That's where the real problem lives. And the real problem is what they'll pay to solve.

Keep asking why until you get there.

## DRAFT A: Operator Take

Salesforce just killed Heroku Enterprise.

End of Sale. February 5, 2026.

They're calling it "sustaining engineering mode."

Translation: No new features. No roadmap. Maintenance only.

Here's what that means for your ops:

Support gets worse.
Salesforce cut 4,000 support jobs this year. The team left behind knows their product has no future. Tickets slow down. Escalations go nowhere.

Security becomes reactive.
Patches only. No proactive hardening. No compliance updates until something breaks.

Your best people leave first.
Nobody builds a career on a dying platform. Senior engineers are already looking. What's left handles your production incidents.

Recruiting gets harder.
"We run on Heroku" is now a red flag. Every candidate asks about the migration plan.

Contract leverage is gone.
Renewal coming up? Salesforce knows you're locked in. They'll charge whatever they want.

---

The pattern:

2011: Salesforce acquires Heroku for $212M.
2025: Salesforce cuts 4,000 jobs for AI.
2026: End of Sale. No roadmap.

They extracted what they needed. Then moved on.

The question isn't whether to migrate.

It's whether you migrate on your timeline or theirs.

At Stacksync, we connect to any Postgres. Heroku, Railway, Render, self-hosted.

Your data layer shouldn't depend on one vendor's AI strategy.

Let's talk. 🤜

## DRAFT B: Process Playbook Style

Your deployment platform just entered maintenance mode.

Salesforce confirmed: Heroku Enterprise is End of Sale.

No new features. No investment. Just keeping the lights on.

Here's what happens next:

1. Support degrades.
4,000 jobs cut. AI handles 50% of interactions. Response times increase.

2. Security becomes reactive.
Patches only. No proactive improvements. Compliance updates slow down.

3. Talent leaves.
Senior engineers don't build careers on dying platforms. They're already looking.

4. Recruiting gets harder.
"We use Heroku" becomes a red flag. Candidates ask for the migration plan.

5. Contract leverage disappears.
Salesforce knows you're locked in. They set the price.

---

The $212M platform Salesforce called "the future of cloud computing" is now in hospice care.

Smart teams are already:
- Auditing Heroku dependencies
- Evaluating alternatives (Render, Railway, Fly.io)
- Building migration plans before they're forced to

At Stacksync, we connect to any Postgres. Heroku, Railway, Render, self-hosted.

Your data layer shouldn't depend on one vendor's AI strategy.

That's your signal. 😎

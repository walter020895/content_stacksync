Sales is fishing.

And if you only have one bait in the water, you're not going to catch much.

I've been in sales for over twenty years. The reps who struggle are usually the ones betting everything on one approach.

All cold calls. Or all LinkedIn. Or all email sequences.

Then they wonder why the pipeline is dry.

Here's how I think about it:

You need a few different lures sitting out there at the same time.

Some prospects respond to calls. Some hate them. Some live on LinkedIn. Some only open emails at 6AM.

You don't know which bait is going to work until you see what starts to bite.

Once something hits, you can focus there. Double down on what's working.

But you can't optimize what you haven't tested.

The other thing about fishing: patience matters.

You don't yank the line the second you feel a nibble. You let them take it. You set the hook at the right moment.

Same with sales. Someone engages with your content? Don't blast them with a pitch immediately.

Let them bite. Then set the hook.

Multiple baits. Patience. Then focus on what's working.

That's the process.

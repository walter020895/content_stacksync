image_suggestion: Simple graphic showing "5 bosses / 14 months" with revolving door visual. Alternative: Calendar with X marks showing leadership changes. Or a process diagram that keeps getting restarted. The visual should convey instability.

Five C-level bosses in fourteen months.

That's what I lived through at my last company.

Every new leader wanted to do something different. New process. New tools. New priorities.

"We tried that two years ago" didn't matter. We'd start over anyway.

The leads were still coming in. The product was solid. But we never got a chance to build consistency.

You can't test if something works when you abandon it every 90 days.

Here's what I learned:

Consistency beats perfection.

A decent process you stick with for six months will outperform a "perfect" process you change every quarter.

Because sales is about patterns. You need reps to run the same play enough times to know what's actually working and what's not.

AB testing doesn't work if you never finish the test.

When I look at a new opportunity now, one of my first questions is: how long has the sales leadership been in place?

If the answer is "we just brought in a new VP" or "we're restructuring the team," I know what's coming.

Change isn't the problem. Constant change is.

Pick a process. Run it. Measure it. Then decide if it needs to change.

That's how you build something that actually works.

Stop trying to close on the first call.

I've watched demos where reps rush through everything trying to get the signature before the prospect hangs up.

It almost never works.

The fear is always the same: "If I slow down, I'll extend the sales cycle."

That's backwards.

Not asking all the questions up front is what extends your sales cycle.

You skip discovery. You don't uncover all the objections. You don't find out who else needs to be on the call.

Then you ask for the business and they say: "We still have questions."

Now you're chasing. Calling back. Sending follow-ups that go nowhere.

That's what actually extends your cycle.

Here's what I do instead:

First call is discovery. 30 minutes. No demo. Just questions.

What brought you here? Where are you in your evaluation? Who else needs to be involved? What's your timeline?

Then we schedule the demo with the right people in the room.

When I ask for the business, there are no surprises. Everyone's aligned. Questions are answered.

Slowing down the front end speeds up the back end.

Every time.

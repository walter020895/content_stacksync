The follow-up call that actually works:

Most reps call and ask: "Just checking in—did you review the proposal?"

That's begging.

20+ years taught me a different approach:

1. Set a timeline on the call. Together.
2. Both agree: "On this date, we'll meet again."
3. If they reschedule—ask one question: "What's changed?"

That's it.

"What's changed?" does three things:
- Surfaces real objections
- Reveals if the deal is dead
- Shows you respect their time (and yours)

No chasing.
No 10-email sequences hoping for a reply.
Just clarity.

Your CRM should work the same way.

If you're chasing data across systems, reconciling spreadsheets, asking "where's the latest number?"—you're not selling.

You're auditing.

Buckle up.

Brothers. Since Day One.

Some friendships fade. Some friendships stretch across decades, deployments, life, loss, and every version of who we've become.

These two didn't just step up to the line — they walked right over it.

Staff Sergeant Jason Richards, USMC
Corporal Jed Richards, USMC

We grew up together. We got in trouble together. We figured life out the hard way. And they put on the uniform and carried a weight most people will never understand.

Wendy Harris (can you make sure they both see this...going to be like hearding cats. Godspeed).

First memory of Jed: 3 years old, in a diaper, running laps around a basketball goal like it was the Indy 500.
Not much has changed — still too small to play and still wearing diapers, just a different brand (according to him).

Jason — the quiet one until the moment it mattered. The one who runs toward the fire when everyone else steps back. Never had to say much — because he showed up.

I didn't serve. They did.

But I learned from them — loyalty, accountability, and doing hard things without needing applause for it.

Now your turn.

Who in the service are you personally thankful for?
Before anyone gets dramatic:
Yes — we honor all veterans and active service members.

But today is about the individuals who shaped your life.
Drop a name. Tell a story. Let them be seen while they're still here to hear it.

Boomband need to borrow a speaker today. I'll give it back, someday. Maybe. Probably not.

### HOOK A (Recommended)

Every logistics company I've worked with runs the same five systems. Every one of them has the same three integration failures.

### HOOK B

I spent 4 years selling integration tools to logistics companies. The pattern was always the same. Five systems. Three breaking points. Nobody budgets for the fix.

### HOOK C

TMS. WMS. ERP. CRM. EDI. Five systems. Not one of them was designed to talk to the others.

### VISUAL HOOKS

**Option A (Recommended): Spaghetti Architecture Diagram**
Top half: Five boxes (TMS, WMS, ERP, CRM, EDI) connected by tangled red lines with warning icons at three intersection points. Messy, chaotic, real. Bottom half: Same five boxes connected through one clean central hub (Stacksync). The contrast between chaos and order IS the argument.
*Matches hook: "Five systems. Three failures." The visual makes the pattern instantly scannable.*

**Option B: Three Failure Cards**
Three clean cards, each showing one failure: Card 1 — "Inventory mismatch" with WMS/ERP icons and a clock showing 4-hour delay. Card 2 — "Stale order status" with CRM icon and a customer on hold. Card 3 — "Silent EDI failure" with a document icon and a red "3 days unnoticed" badge. Simple, specific, painful.
*Matches hook: Makes each failure concrete. Logistics ops managers recognize their own stack.*

**Option C: The Reconciliation Cost Calculator**
A simple equation graphic: "10 hrs/week manual reconciliation x $75/hr x 52 weeks = $39,000/year." Below it: "For a problem software should handle." Clean, black text on white. The math IS the visual.
*Matches hook: Tony is the numbers guy. The cost made visible is the punchline.*

### FULL POST (using Hook A)

---

Every logistics company I've worked with runs the same five systems. Every one of them has the same three integration failures.

The five systems:
- TMS (transportation management)
- WMS (warehouse management)
- ERP (NetSuite, SAP)
- CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- EDI (partner and 3PL data exchange)

The three failures:

1. Inventory counts that don't match between WMS and ERP. Somebody finds out during a customer call. Not before.

2. Order status that's 2-4 hours stale in the CRM. Sales promises a delivery date based on data that was accurate at breakfast.

3. EDI documents that fail silently. A purchase order sits in a queue for 3 days because a schema changed and nobody got an alert.

I've seen this at companies with 200 employees and companies with 5,000. The stack looks the same. The failures look the same.

Most logistics teams solve this with people. Somebody checks the numbers manually every morning. Somebody reconciles the ERP and WMS every Friday. Somebody babysits the EDI feed.

That's not integration. That's paying someone to copy-paste between tabs.

Real-time sync between all five systems means the WMS update hits the ERP and CRM in the same second. EDI failures trigger alerts, not silence. And your ops team stops spending 10+ hours a week reconciling data that software should keep in sync.

Just math.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Tony. Short, punchy sentences. Fragments ("Not before."). Numbers-backed claims (5 systems, 3 failures, 200 vs 5,000 employees, 2-4 hours, 3 days, 10+ hours/week). Names specific tools (NetSuite, SAP, Salesforce, HubSpot). No hedging. Builds authority through pattern recognition ("I've seen this at..."). Ends with "Just math." signature closer.
- **Idea Legos**: Investigator hook + Pattern → Breakdown → Failures → Cost → Closer confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Pattern claim → Five systems listed → Three failures detailed (each with specific consequence) → Scale proof (200 to 5,000) → The human workaround exposed → Real-time solution → Clean closer
- **Ego bait**: Logistics ops managers and supply chain directors see their exact stack and their exact problems. The "somebody checks manually" line makes them feel seen. VPs of Engineering at logistics companies recognize the data reconciliation burden.
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: logistics integration failures. Single question: "What are the three failures?" Pattern: Investigator (revealing a hidden, repeatable pattern from deep industry experience).
- **Traffic driver**: Logistics, supply chain, TMS, WMS, ERP, EDI, NetSuite, SAP, Salesforce, 3PL integration (all vertical-specific ICP terms)
- **AI slop check**: Clean. No em dashes. No "Here's" constructions. "That's not integration. That's paying someone to copy-paste between tabs." uses the contrast structure but both halves are concrete and specific (not abstract "Not X. It's Y."). Lists are Tony's natural format. "Just math." is his established professional closer.

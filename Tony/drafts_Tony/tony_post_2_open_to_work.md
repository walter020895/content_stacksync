# Open to Work

I'm officially open to Sales Director or Sales Manager opportunities—open to IC roles at the right company.

I build revenue engines—not just sales teams.

What I've delivered: → 112% quota attainment (15 of 18 quarters) → $100M+ career revenue generated → 49% QoQ growth at scale → Forecast accuracy within 3-5% → Built Celigo's Emerging Business segment from $0 → Global Sales Manager of the Year (2024)

My expertise:
iPaaS, SaaS, and AI-native GTM strategies
Channel partnerships ($6M+ net-new ARR annually)
Turning underperforming teams into top performers
MEDDPICC + operational discipline

What I'm looking for: Growth-stage SaaS company ($5-75M ARR) that values grit, forecast accuracy, and a force-multiplier approach to leadership. Remote-first preferred.

If you're a founder, CRO, VP, or investor building something real—or know someone who is—I'd love to connect.

DMs open. Let's talk.

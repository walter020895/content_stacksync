Them: Okay. Got  
Me: we're very early in this company.  
Them: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then  
Me: Tell tell me more about you, Tony.  
Them: yeah. So well, yeah. I'm here in Indiana. I've I've let's see. On the personal side, you know, I've got two boys. I have one that's a junior in high school. And my other one, Beau, was a freshman. In college. He plays football at Saint Francis.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: So that's been neat. American football, not soccer. I played soccer.  
Me: Alright. Yeah. Yeah. You play soccer. Nice.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So this is I'm like, nobody none of the kids played I'm like, alright. But that's been fun. And then, you know, for me, it's just I've been looking you know, I was with monster.com, like, for fifteen years, and that to number of positions was there early as we grew and then went public. After that, I spent, like, two years at so I was a director there, and I had, like, five teams and then moved to small, like, startup cloud security company for a couple years. I just didn't enjoy the industry. I liked it. Like, the team aspect, but the industry But what really caught my attention was I had an opportunity to meet with Saligo, and that's kinda what opened my eyes to the iPad space.  
Me: I  
Them: And learning you know, I sat for years on the other side of the desk trying to put together business plans with disparate systems.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And so it was like, I understood right then, like, the power of what a true iPaaS could do. And so that's you know, I had I was the second manager at Saligo, and then we opened up the commercial on that. And it's just Saligo's had so much change. Like, I had five c level bosses in fourteen months.  
Me: Wow.  
Them: That's a change. So it was like we we never quite like, the leads were still coming, but we never really it was just too much change. You know? And we started doing  
Me: K.  
Them: every leader that came in wanted to do something  
Me: Different.  
Them: you know, Yeah. And it's like, we did that a couple of years ago. So it was like, we never got a chance to build consistency, which for me, it's that's we at least gotta stick with one process for a little while to test it and see if it works.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Do the AB testing. You know? So the opportunity to come here, it was you know, in the same field, but it was I'm starting to see kind of the opportunities. Like, what is it that's bringing the customers here?  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: So right now, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what is it that where is our end. So I guess I'll ask you with the product. Like, what did what attracted you to StackSync?  
Me: Yeah. And most people person. So I really I I worked for staxing, like, for one month as a as a freelancer.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Doing some community posts on hotspot community. And I I get to know Ruben at that time, like, last year, but the but this time. So I have, I enjoy the time with him, knowing him, like talking to him. He or he, of course, have more more time so I can't just speak to them. So I think that people made companies So I really I really I really like Ruben. I really like Alexis. And I I I, Macho, it's one of my  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: my best friends here. So I was working in this another company, and I was doing good. I mean, like, you have, like, this c level thing, but I'm more like I really wanted to  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: to be part of something even bigger, something global, At at the end of the day, we were focused on Latin market. So that wasn't big enough, I think, for me.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So I decided to jump on this that is global. Like, we are trying to do some good stuff. And most important, people people are are good people. You know? Like, being able in to be in a company that has, like,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: four minutes to pray, I think that I I've never seen that So I it's it's very, very warming, very welcoming to somebody who comes  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So that that's why I've joined here. I I I think that product and everything else can it's, like, top down that you know, like, everything will come. You were going to figure it out. I love making content. I I I'm I'm always seeking what is the psychology behind  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: why content attracts people, and that's all I think every day. Like, how I can make it a better content. Fortunately, we got some very good good things going on here, but that's what attracted me to is testing.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, think the postings you'll figure out kind of my flow. Basically, I'd set it up in Cloud anytime I do a post, I run it in there until it to match the flow. So that way, I'll just kinda you know, anything you wanna do, I'll just as long as it I think you'll figure out the flow and  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: yeah, let's do it. Because  
Me: Yeah, man. What I'm what I will what I will do is, like, I'm going to  
Them: yeah.  
Me: ask you some questions later on this week. So I can figure out your way of thinking, your way of processing the things. And then I will have, like, a a complete m g file where all of your personality that's what I'm I'm looking for with some questions.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: And then I will ask you eventually, like, what do you think about this? And then you will give me the insight. I think, you know, we'll figure it out how to how to get that to a post. But, yeah, we we will make it work.  
Them: Got it. So do you have a process well, I guess when you do content, and we get a lead that engages, does that I'm just trying to figure out the different lead process.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So but response to you, how does then what happens? Like, a lead you do content, A lead responds, let's say,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: LinkedIn or something, then what happens?  
Me: What I I tried to get the LinkedIn post the most viral possible, you know, first. Then and and and I do that like, talking about what our ICP or our or the people of our industry understands. Like, enterprise systems, Oracle, work Workday and everything. So then there is, like, like, the  
Them: Okay.  
Me: the next day, I review the post, the likes, the comments, see who interacted with. So I'll review all the profiles and check if that can be could be a good lead, could be an interesting person to talk about, to connect with, And then if I, a spot, like, very, very, like like a person who matched our ICP, like, exactly. That will goes to natural. And I say, here it is. Here these people just interact with us. I think we should first connect through LinkedIn, then you can enrich his information through Play or something. And then he manages all the interaction down there. So he he I mean, like, I I just informed him, and he managed everything.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: After that.  
Them: Okay. What RICP So are we target what is do we have a couple of different ICPs, or can I'm just trying to gather  
Me: Yeah. The this is this is how I see that.  
Them: who we're targeting.  
Me: Of course, I I don't have, like, exactly what are our ICP is because I tried to talk to a broader audience.  
Them: For sure.  
Me: But, I talked to Alexis just on the weekend, make sure this is what what I'm thinking is okay. So our ICP is, like, people who have decision power over the people who work on data. You know? Like, data engineers who are doing plan b, like ATL, reverse ATL, and all things that are very difficult. So people who have decision over those kind of teams that are our ICP because they need to connect their enterprise systems with their CRM and have the information real time. So that that's how I  
Them: What side is? What titles are those typically? C I CIO, CTO?  
Me: Our c CTOs, chief revenue officers, two are also involved. Data head of data teams are also, like, that that's for now. I see I have a an MD and a document that I can share with you with the  
Them: Okay.  
Me: correct ICP if you want.  
Them: Yeah. I'm just trying to because it will help kinda thinking about who we talk to. Because usually, I was talking to operations, IT,  
Me: Fetch.  
Them: So it's probably business owners chief revenue officers. So it's probably a lot of the same personas.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's aligned. It's aligned. Because we need the the the decision maker are the people who are are going to buy us, you know. So they they are and it has to be I have to understand the technical problem behind what are we offering. So, yes, that's why CTOs, CROs, Yeah.  
Them: Okay. So I guess the other question I have, and it may not you may not know, but so do we we don't charge for the connectors. It's more I'm trying to understand the  
Me: Okay. I I I don't I don't have the correct answer, Edgar.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: So maybe instead of inferring this, you should maybe ask who has that.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's fine. I've got a couple meetings today. I'm just figuring out who's got  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: who knows what, and  
Me: Yeah. We we're like a every every piece  
Them: okay.  
Me: is like a a little bit broken, you know, because we're growing and and everything, like, it has  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I I know  
Them: So you  
Me: So  
Them: you're more, marketing aspect social content. Okay. So will you also do then, like, email campaigns or  
Me: No. No. Email can  
Them: is that  
Me: No. No. Email campaigns, I I help with the copywriting there, like,  
Them: that  
Me: Nacho asked me for feedback because we have to, like, create some psychological trigger, something like very much what we are looking for.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: But he is the main the main the main guy who's in charge is Nacho.  
Them: Oh,  
Me: Nacho, and he's working with an agency too. So yeah.  
Them: okay. Okay. Okay. Got it. Not just on agency. I'm just trying to figure out when stuff comes in. Like, who do I go to? Okay.  
Me: Yeah. The the main people I think the main people you  
Them: Good.  
Me: you're going to be talking with is, like, a natural because he's on church of everything. Then you'll be talking to Ruben and  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Carter. I think those are going to be your main connection. Also me because I'm going do content for you. But those are the the main people that you're going to be talking to.  
Them: Okay. Do we Okay. Do we have any just I'm thinking about just in your world. Any marketing webinars? Do we have a schedule or a calendar of any upcoming events?  
Me: We we did some kind of webinars I mean, like, I wasn't here, but I knew because of Nacho. But I think that they didn't work that well. So what I know that worked well was  
Them: Because  
Me: going to events. And they have the schedule of the next  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: conference, something like that. So I don't know when are are going to be and I don't know when those events are going to occur, but I'm sure that that worked well. Webinars and everything, we we didn't we didn't they didn't I they didn't like it, so they don't do that.  
Them: There might be something  
Me: Anymore.  
Them: So, Salique, we we got a decent amount not a ton, but it like, at Saligo, if you do the search on Saligo's webinars, that was their big play. Every month or two. So you could see how those are set up sometimes they would have if you search on Slego webinars, you'll see different topics coming up. That tend to that's been something they've done. Jeez.  
Me: And  
Them: For four years.  
Me: And and they still work, I think. Yeah. They  
Them: Yeah. I mean, some of it. It's but it's at least that'll give you an idea on you know, what they're doing.  
Me: Yeah. They have a lot of webinars.  
Them: But they've been that's been consistent. You know? It's, like, each month, they're putting out something. Now I don't know because we didn't have the reporting to say, how much came back from the webinar. But it was it was just another avenue that we used.  
Me: Okay. I'm I'm I'm going to study a little bit more how they do it, how often, and maybe I can I can I can I can can propose this to Nacho and and the team? Yeah. Yeah. It's a good idea.  
Them: Well, it's something it's something to look at and see if you know, if it, makes sense or maybe there's a different variation. But that's what I told Ruben as I start thinking your stuff. I'm just as it comes up, I'll just keep sharing.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Keep doing that. It's amazing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: We'll figure out what works.  
Me: That's nice. Nice. Do you have any other questions?  
Them: No. I think right now, it's just probably have a lot, but it's more just trying to figure out, you know,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: where to go. So are you're you're you're based in Bolivia won't not San Francisco. Right?  
Me: No. No. I'm I'm based on on Bolivia. But I think that I will be traveling traveling a lot. Because I'm going to go to to the office, headquarters, but yeah, I'm I'm eventually want to live, like, like, six months here in Bolivia and six six months in San Francisco and full committed on the vaccine, so let's see how it goes.  
Them: Yeah. Okay. Do you do any fishing in Bolivia?  
Me: No. No. We don't. I I I personally don't do any fishing. I think that some people do that, but I I didn't I have no opportunity to do that. So if you can teach me,  
Them: What do you like? Oh, I could yeah. I could teach you the fish easy What do you like to do for just outside of work?  
Me: I I I like to read a lot, man. I'm going to show you here that this is my like, my library. I can show you right wait a second. I like to read allotment. That that's my  
Them: Holy moly.  
Me: thing, I think. No. Here it is.  
Them: Holy moly. Okay.  
Me: Yeah. I like to read a lot of books so that's what I'm like, I I really like to do that. And, also, gym. I like to go to the gym. I like to train.  
Them: So what do you what type of are you  
Me: And  
Them: the type of work I'm doing to push pull legs.  
Me: Yes. That that's good. I I I used  
Them: Like, roaches,  
Me: to do that too. I used to do that that too. So, yeah, I I I I do an I've done that. I like muscle per day. So yeah. Yeah. You go to the gym too. Like, how how long have you been going? How long?  
Them: Yeah. Twenty something years. Yeah. I mean, bet I go I started working out in high school and try to just, you know, sometimes you get busy, but I try to make sure I get it in. For me, I go in the mornings so I go you know, it like, 6AM. So I'm back here.  
Me: Oh, my that's early in the morning.  
Them: 07:30. Yeah. But, you know,  
Me: I'm more, like, a late night guy who goes to the gym, like, 11PM.  
Them: oh, no. Oh, no way. No. Because I just found you know, because with being in sales, and I've always you know, had teams that have sit out west or people all over, it's just easier for me Like, that's my time to kinda just focus on myself and not anything else. Because the rest of the day, you know, it could be 06:00, and I'm getting a potential lead or something. So, I just have found with me, it's easier. I get busier as the day goes on. So  
Me: So Yeah.  
Them: if I can get that out of the way in the morning, then it's like, okay.  
Me: Nah.  
Them: Because if I wait till later, it's not gonna happen.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I it's opposite for me. I mean, like, the my earning in the morning, I do all the things that I can. I push, to work everything I can. Then at resting, like, 9PM, I have to calm down, go to gym, focus on that. So  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: it's different schedules, but I think that it works.  
Them: That's good. That's good. When are you coming to San Francisco?  
Me: I think it's, the last week of February or March, so I'm going to visit the team. Yeah. Yeah. I I hope you are going to San Francisco too. Some  
Them: Yeah. I just don't know when yet.  
Me: Okay. Okay. Okay. I hope I hope to see you there or  
Them: Yeah. Oh,  
Me: in the retreat. That will be good.  
Them: I'll definitely be at the retreat. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. That's good, man. Have you ever have you ever been on on Europe with Europe before?  
Them: No. I haven't.  
Me: No. Okay. Okay. This is gonna be my first time too, so I'm very excited about that.  
Them: Have you?  
Me: You know, that that kinds of fuels me energy. So the I I I have to be here. I have to work hard. We have to go there. Yeah. That's why I'm  
Them: I'm right there with you. I'm right there with you. I'm like, okay. We've gotta make this happen because I wanna go there. And I want us to be able to celebrate. Like, yeah. We kicked ass.  
Me: Yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I I wanted to ask you something if you don't mind. I wanted to ask you how did you learn to sell sales? I mean, like, for me, it's very difficult to learn sales.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: I I bring I I read books. Like, but but I think that people like you like, who's been selling, like, in the real world, can tell me something.  
Them: You know, it's people get a so I learned to sell I mean, quite honestly, I was in college and did a project, and we had to do this coupon booklet. And, basically, door to door. Right? And it was, like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I enjoy talking to people. And it was one of those things that you know, I found over the years it's you talk to people, but it's also getting them if you can position it to where get them to tell you what their problem is, why why are we talking today? What brought you? Nine times out of 10, it's a lot of the whys. Like, what is it? Why is this happening? Why do you need to do this? So for me, it's it's I think what I could do is some of the recordings, and maybe we set up some time, and I can definitely give you some tips, but it's more about for me, finding the process. And that's why I was watching, like, the demos because everybody's trying to close it on one call. And I don't but the thing is I'm not seeing those deals close on the first call. So I am looking at it in the sense of I typically do a demo or not a demo on the first call. It's more like, listen, set up thirty minutes and do a discovery call. May I ask you questions so I can you tell me what's going on. And then we set up a demo. I'm trying to figure out this process a little bit because I think there's power to be able to show real quick. How quick the system is, the mapping, and all of a sudden, like, yeah, you the sync is done. That's the area I wanna look at. And for me, it's just understanding this sales process and, like, how many the one thing I wanna look at is as well is how many lead like, what's our close ratio? Because that's where I was looking at some of the deals yesterday, and it's like, now I got HubSpot access so I can get in it today. But I wanna see just you know, how many opportunities have we met with versus how many that's close. Because I think that gives me an idea on one, where we're losing, and two, is it are we not getting deep enough in the questions, or is it something you know, we're not overcoming an objection?  
Me: Yeah. You're right. Right. That's very interesting. Yeah. I think that everybody here wants to do so want to do it so fast. Like, hello. Buy my thing now.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I have another call. You know? And and that's not the a good way, I think. Because they need to figure it out the process to understand the product, to understand that they trust us, And, yeah, you're you're you're right, man. You're right. Yeah. I will be  
Them: We start we start  
Me: tell me, sir.  
Them: that's where we lost a lot of the sales coming into Saligo. So when I started, we were closing deals, but what I started noticing. Was like, hey. We're losing a lot of deals, and they didn't have a sales process. It was like, trying to close everything on the first call. And the fear was oh, this is gonna extend our sales cycle. Well, no. Because if you're not asking all the questions up front, that's what's in getting the answers. That's what extends your sales cycle. Because you didn't uncover everything. So now you're asking them, hey. I need you to invest with me and sign this. And they're like, well, we still have questions. So that's where I'm thinking is, like, I want to be able to kinda slow that process down. To real call, dig in with the clients, and understand their use case and really what's brought them to us and also what's their past experience been like. Because there's something that is making them if they were happy, they wouldn't wanna talk. Or maybe they need it, and this is their first time using a tool like this. So but that's all information, I think, that's what I'm looking at, and I talked to Carter today just to see, you know, my initial thought on those demos is, like, we're trying to move too quick. And if we just let's set the stage do a little bit more fact finding, and get reopened up. That way, when we ask for the business, because some of the ones I listen to is, like, we don't have every the power of people always on that call. So it's, like, that's where I think if we define, like, okay, who's that first call for me is, like, understanding, but also at the same time, like, where are you at in this process? In your evaluation, is this something you're ready to move on? Or are you just beginning to evaluate? Because that way, that keeps me from then chasing that client and calling like, hey. Have you looked at it? Are you ready? I don't do that. It's more I set up, like, let's set up a timeline, something to where we both agree, like, okay. On this date, we'll meet. That way I can hold them accountable. So if they're like, hey.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: They don't show up or if they say, hey. We gotta reschedule, then I can ask, like, hey. What's changed?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: You know? Things like that, oh, yeah, we definitely  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: help you with. And once I get rolling here on some demos, yeah, you're more than welcome to join, listen,  
Me: Okay, man.  
Them: That way, it might be better tailor some of the content. You know?  
Me: Yeah. For sure. For sure. Adapting myself too to the environment here. But I'm I'm I'm digging more on the product. I want to under understand how to use it too so I can make more content. But I think what your talk is very interesting  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: so we need we need to be patient. And to be able it's like like, maybe maybe because I don't know a lot, maybe it's like fishing. You got to put the and then wait.  
Them: Yeah. You gotta you gotta I but you gotta have a lot  
Me: You know? And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,  
Them: different baits in the water. Right? So I think if you go with just one, it never works. But I try to have have a few different lures sitting out there. And see what starts to bite, and then we can focus on that.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing, Tony. It was a pleasure to meet you, man. I hope I hope we can work in a very good way. Whatever you need from the content side,  
Them: It's good. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  
Me: I'm I'm here here I'm here to help. I'm going to be start to  
Them: Okay.  
Me: making some drafts if you so I can I can start posting to you? But everything you need, I'm here to help as long as I can because I'm mute  
Them: Yep.  
Me: in this company too, but I will do my best.  
Them: Awesome. No. It'd be great working with you. We'll have fun.  
Me: Nice. Nice, Tony. Have a good day.  
Them: You good? We'll talk to you You good? We'll talk to you later.  
Me: Bye bye.  
Them: Bye.

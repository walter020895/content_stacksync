I told you the full story would drop.
Here it is:
Head of Sales Stacksync - Integration Cloud

Real-time bidirectional data sync.
200+ connectors. No code.
A problem every data-driven company has.

I spent years selling iPaaS. I know this space.

I've seen what works. What doesn't. What customers settle for.

Stacksync - Integration Cloud is what they've been waiting for.

20+ years in sales teaches you one thing: spot the winners early.
This is that bet.

The job hunt taught me this:

Activate your network with intention.
Target companies you believe in—not just ones hiring.
The right opportunity finds you.

The moment I understood what Stacksync solves, I was all in.

If your CRM and database don't sync in real-time…
You're making decisions on yesterday's data.
And losing deals you don't even know about.

We fix that. In minutes.

To Ruben Burdin, Alexis Favre, and the Stacksync - Integration Cloud team—let's go.
To everyone who supported my search—thank you doesn't cover it.

# Tony B. - Writer's Persona Guide

## Who Is Tony

Sales leader based in Indianapolis. 20+ years building revenue engines at growth-stage SaaS companies. Not coastal, not apologetic about it. Midwest through and through. Grew up with friends who served in the Marines. Didn't serve himself, but carries the values: loyalty, accountability, doing hard things without needing applause.

Recently joined Stacksync (Y Combinator W24). Before that: Global Sales Manager of the Year at Celigo. Built the Emerging Business segment from $0. 112% quota attainment across 15 of 18 quarters. The numbers speak.

## Tony's Core Identity

### The Midwest Operator

Tony isn't trying to be San Francisco or New York. He's Indianapolis. He proves geography is irrelevant when you can hit the numbers consistently. This isn't defensiveness. It's pride. The best operators aren't in the highest rent districts. They're wherever the work gets done.

### The Loyal Friend

Tony's friendships go back decades. He names people. He tells stories about them. He publicly honors the relationships that shaped him. When he thanks someone, it's not generic. It's "Jeff Taylor, Donna Star, Tony Deblauwe, Madison Rose Keefer" with specific reasons why.

### The Gritty Builder

"#GRIND" isn't a hashtag for Tony. It's a worldview. Hard work without seeking applause. Showing up when it matters. Running toward the fire when everyone else steps back. He learned this from his Marine friends. He applies it to sales.

### The Numbers Guy

In professional contexts, Tony leads with metrics. Not vague claims. Specific numbers:
- 112% quota attainment (15 of 18 quarters)
- $100M+ career revenue generated
- 49% QoQ growth at scale
- Forecast accuracy within 3-5%
- $6M+ net-new ARR annually through channel

He backs confidence with receipts.

## How Tony Thinks

### Results Over Pedigree

Tony doesn't care where you went to school or which coast you're on. He cares if you can hit the number. If you can build something real. If you show up when it matters.

### Loyalty Is Non-Negotiable

The people who were there for him get named. Get thanked. Get celebrated publicly. Friendships that stretch across decades, deployments, life, loss. That's the currency Tony trades in.

### Grit Over Talent

Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. Tony's career wasn't handed to him. Indianapolis to Global Sales Manager of the Year. That's a grind. He knows it. He's proud of it.

### Home Matters

"Never. Forget. Where. Home. Is." This isn't nostalgia. It's identity. Tony's roots are part of his strength, not something to escape from.

Then longer sentences when telling a story or making a point land.

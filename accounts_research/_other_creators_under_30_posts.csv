Aakash Gupta,"Social media creates attention monsters. Instead of the most original thoughts, creators pursue the strongest hooks. One startup wants to change that:

How many layoff posts have you seen lately? Remote work copy-paste jobs?

When the incentive is to seek attention and get likes, behavior follows.

But compare social media to podcasts. The incentives are totally different. With a podcast feed, the creator is directly sending content to fans who have subscribed. So, instead, the incentive is for high QUALITY content.

Is it possible to create the same dynamic for writing? This inspired Chris, Hamish & Jairaj (pictured) to found Substack.

Their mission? “Make it simple to start a publication that makes money from subscriptions.” If they could create a new market of content, by making it economical for writers, they could create a new media.

So far, it’s been working. The last time we got subscriber numbers from Substack, they had over 1M paying subscribers. That was up ~100% from the year prior. At an average cost of $7 per month, and 10% take rate, that’s a yearly revenue of $8.4M. Not bad for a company <6 years old.

It’s working out for its content creators, too. The top 10 writers make over $20M a year combined. Lenny Rachitsky shared he makes more on Substack than he did as a PM at Airbnb. Substack is set to be the next Twitch or YouTube, each of which have 10K+ creators living on them.

What product strategy and positioning has allowed Substack to get to this point?

1. Substack offers true independence for writers.

You own your email list. So, you can always walk away. This is totally different from Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook’s options.

2. Substack focuses on making the experience easy & simple.

Time to publish is super low. Compared to competitor ConvertKit, Substack offers less customization, analytics, and advertising monetization features. It just makes writing super simple.

3. Substack gets the fundamentals, like SEO & deliverability really right.

My 1 year old Substack crushes my Wordpress blog of 10 years on SEO. Others have measured the same for email deliverability vs other providers. Substack is #1 in the 2 most important areas.

Substack can pursue this focused positioning because it is built for one persona:

· Not for social media personalities. They might prefer Twitter or LinkedIn’s offerings
· Not for techies. They might prefer Wordpress or ConvertKit
· For writers who wants to focus on writing.

What can we learn from Substack’s phenomenal product growth?

1. You can create wholly new markets, instead of competing in saturated one’s.
2. Simpler is better, especially if you have a focused persona.
3. Getting the basics really right, instead of just ok, is a great wedge.",165.0,13.0,3.0,181.0,1.0,Teacher,Engineering Career,Framework/How-To,List Post,Text-only,"Social media creates attention monsters.

Aakash Gupta,"I thought there'd be consensus on how to monetize AI by now. I was (mostly) wrong.

There's outcome-based pricing (see: Intercom, Crescendo, Chargeflow), credit pricing (see: Salesforce, Lovable), work-based pricing (see: Imagen, EvenUp), hybrid pricing (see: Monday, Clay), and lots more.

The only thing people seem to agree on is that AI credits are bad. But they're also a lifeline to protect against exploding costs. The top 10% of your users might account for 70-80% of your AI costs. (Heck, even MoviePass is selling credits these days.)

I'll be unpacking how to (profitably) add AI to your product with Aakash Gupta from Product Growth and Axel Sooriah from Atlassian Jira Product Discovery.

On the agenda: why AI products fail to make money, the connection between pricing models & profits, the evolving unit economics of AI, and how product teams need to work differently.

Adam Robinson,"Kyle Poyar just analyzed new data from 6,525 SaaS startups and it's WILD. Only 3.3% reach $1 million ARR in less than a year from first revenue. And just 1-in-1000 reach $10 million in less than a year!!

Thats not what you'd think if you only listen to VCs on Twitter.

You'd think if you're not at $100M ARR in 6 months you might as well give up.

Kyle partnered with ChartMogul and dug into their dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years and here's what he found: 

For startups that reach $1M ARR, it usually takes 2-5 years from monetization. 

1. Only 3.3% of startups reach $1 million in under 1 year
2. 13.4% reach $1 million in under 3 years
3. 25.1% reach that figure within 5 years

You can map yourself onto the curve below (see graphic). 

It takes time to find PMF and move from founder-led sales to repeatable growth. And premature scaling can kill a great business. 

That's why many of the best companies started slow:

- Lovable spent 18 months building before their breakthrough success
- Clay grinded for 6 years before seeing revenue traction
- Bolt spent 7 years to get to $700k ARR before their new product exploded

Tomorrow Kyle (Founder of Growth Unhinged) is joining me on Unf*ck My Startup LIVE to share the realistic playbook for sustainable startup growth.

If you're a founder feeling discouraged by hyper-growth narratives, this session will provide the data-driven clarity and actionable strategies you need to build a long-term, successful startup.

Adam Robinson,"Adam Robinson has bootstrapped RB2B to $5.5M+ ARR w/ only 3 people (🤯). He just ran a wild experiment to replace RB2B's sales-assist team with a $99 per month AI avatar. Here's what happened next.

First off, very few are suggesting AI as a replacement for salespeople. Remember, for example, how Salesforce said they’re actually hiring 2,000 more salespeople to sell AI?

Well, Adam is an outlier. He's bootstrapped RB2B to date & is on a mission to hit $10M ARR as profitably as humanly possible.

RB2B's sales-assist team was supposed to help customers who weren't ready to buy via self-serve. But there was no convincing data that sales-assist was actually incremental. So Adam wanted to see if AI could do the job instead.

Four weeks into replacing a human sales-assist rep with the AI avatar, RB2B’s metrics look… almost identical. And the AI avatar had 1,683 (!) conversations in its first 22 days including:
 - 304 demo requests
 - 98 SOC2 docs
 - 16 custom pricing quotes

About 10% of the conversations captured an email. 70% of folks who talked to the avatar said the experience was positive. Almost none of the answers were flat-out wrong.

You'll want to read the full story in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/epFMtymA

I’m not sure AI is ready to be a replacement for sales. But it can help augment the sales motion, filling the gaps left behind between fully self-service versus fully sales-managed.

Adam Tank,"I spent over $1,000 on an online writing course.

Here's why investing in writing is the best professional career move you can make👇🏽  

1️⃣ Writing is the fastest way to build a professional brand

- My water & tech focused newsletter has gone from 0 -> 3,663 subscribers in just over 12 months

- Customers, partners, and connections all appreciate learning about you and your interests outside of what your company does

- Easy way to stay top of mind with people you don't often connect with.

2️⃣ You can meet INCREDIBLE people from all over the world, many who become close friends and co-workers

- Writing online gives you 24/7 opportunities to find like minded people in places you may never visit in person. My life would be nowhere near as interesting without fellow writers like Cam, Robbie, Will, Stephen, Amanda, Karena, Florian, Louie, John, and Jim in it.

3️⃣ Refining your thinking leads to better business outcomes

- Your ability to clearly and concisely convey messages in writing, especially in a remote world, directly impacts your ability to be successful at work.

- It's always nice to avoid an extra meeting when it can be taken care of in an e-mail or memo.

If you're interested in learning where to start, the team at Write of Passage is putting on a series of free webinars next month that talk about how to start writing online.

Adam Tornhill,"What can we learn from forensic psychology about… technical debt?!

Over the past couple of weeks I spoke multiple times with Adam Tornhill, author of the super popular book 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗲, and founder of CodeScene. 

Adam has a unique background in psychology + engineering, which led him to develop a forensic approach to code quality: don't just look at current state, but understand what happened and why through 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗵𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆.

His key insight is that tech debt work should focus on 𝗵𝗼𝘁𝘀𝗽𝗼𝘁𝘀: code that is both complex AND frequently changed. Bad—but stable—code isn't a problem: the killer combination is bad code you touch all the time.

Here's what Adam's research found about bad code's impact:

↳ 🐛 𝟭𝟱𝘅 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲
↳ ⏱️ 𝟭𝟮𝟰% 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 
↳ ⁉️ 𝗨𝗽 𝘁𝗼 𝟵𝘅 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝘃𝘀 𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀

That last point hits the hardest — it's not just that bad code takes longer, it's that you can't reliably estimate *how much* longer. 

This week we wrote a full article together where we explored all of this and much more, including the impact of knowledge distribution on your team, the infamous bus factor, and, of course, how to prevent (or remediate) these problems.

Adam Tornhill,"Bad code is bad only if you need to change it. If it looks bad, but is stable, it doesn’t pose any concerns.

This might seem trivial, but it has deep implications. The main one is that you should focus your quality work on 𝗵𝗼𝘁𝘀𝗽𝗼𝘁𝘀 (cit. Adam Tornhill): the parts of your codebase that are frequently subject to change.

As humans we are bad at judging this intuitively, so a lot of work on tech debt is simply misguided: it either happens on bad—but stable—code, or on areas that are active but already in relatively good shape.

This is also hard to evaluate because activity distribution is extremely skewed: in most codebases, ~5% of the code gets 90% of the activity.

This reminds me of something from my startup days.

During an M&A conversation, the buyer’s consulting firm ran a technical due diligence. They found several areas of poor quality code—as we expected. In fact, over time we had doubled down on specific parts of the product we cared about, while phasing out others. The latter stayed experimental: less testing, more duplication, etc.

What I didn’t expect was how hard this proved to be to argue. We pointed to the strategic parts we were proud of, but they weighted the sketchy marginal code as an equal part of the whole.

In other words, the 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 wasn’t considered.

Eventually the M&A failed for a variety of reasons. This was not explicitly mentioned as a blocker, but I always suspected it contributed.

I had a chat with Adam a few months ago that influenced a lot of how I think about this topic.

Addy Osmani,"Why does ""vibe coding"" not lead to anything productive, for the most part? A great person to answer is Addy Osmani: he has been working on Chrome for 10+ years, and has just published his new book: Beyond Vibe Coding.

One point Addy makes is that as software engineers, we should do a lot more AI-assisted software engineering and probably less vibe coding. But these tools are working, and they are changing how development is done in places like Google Chrome's dev team, and beyond.

An interesting quote from this episode from Addy:

“I have more recently been focusing on the idea of spec-driven development, having a very clear plan of what it is that I want to build. 

There are definitely places where I still vibe code. If it’s for a personal tool, something throw away, in the old days, if an engineer or a PM had an idea, maybe we would put together a quick mock, maybe we would put together a wireframe or a sketch or something like that. Perhaps work with UX to come up with something a little bit more polished.

I also think that tests are great. And if you are open to tests, it can be a great way of de-risking your use of LLMs and coding. Because sometimes, even if you’re using state-of-the-art models, you can end up in a situation where maybe the code looks more convoluted than you would expect.""",318.0,25.0,24.0,,,Teacher,Engineering/Technical,Insight/Observation,Statement → Commentary,Text-only,"Why does ""vibe coding"" not lead to anything productive, for the most part?

Advith Chelikani,"I need to address something.

Last week this WSJ article about us went viral.

A lot of opinions lacking context about us as a company and people spread.

Here are important points I want to clarify:

1 - There are multiple founders that were mentioned in this article. What other founders said about their own companies does not apply to us.

2 - This article was about FOUNDERS, not employees. The title is ""AI Startup Founders Tout a Winning Formula..."" At Pylon, the founders (Advith, Robert, me) work insane hours. I've made posts about this and broken down the math on how there are months of non-stop 92 hrs work weeks. It's my belief that founders should work exceptionally hard. Why would anyone ever join your team if the leaders of the company aren't putting in everything to help make the company succeed? At the same time, our expectations for the general team are completely different.

3 - We've never mentioned ""996"" culture or asked our team to come in on weekends. Some people do end up coming in on Sunday but we've never encouraged it, prescribed it, or mentioned it as an expectation during our interview process.

4 - A while back we had made a post about how we as founders lived in the office when we first started the company. For some reason people think non-founders did too. That is false.

5 - The ""No Fun"" part is incorrect (at least for us). Our initial motivation for starting a company was for fun and adventure. But... what fun looks like for us is quite different than what fun is for others. We find the process of company building to be incredibly fun, meaning our work is fun.

6 - I have no problem with work-life balance. Our team should definitely have a life outside of work. You should decide what type of lifestyle you're excited about and go for it. Once again, this article was about founders, not employees (at least for Pylon). For founders, my personal opinion is that building a venture-scale business requires going all-in.",977.0,86.0,12.0,,,Teacher,Startup/Founder,Insight/Observation,Statement → Commentary,Text-only,I need to address something.,"I need to address something.

What most people don't know is that there were ~2 years of virtually no progress before we even got to the initial idea for Pylon.

There's no way we would've been able to predict the combination of moments that led us to this point. 

Now... there's a clear path to disrupt the customer support and success categories in a major way.

We're building Pylon, is the first support platform built for B2B.

Customers absolutely love it.

Advith Chelikani,"We raised Pylon's $31M Series B in 7 days.

We didn't need the money.

And we weren't fundraising.

We were focused on supporting customers, building product, and selling.

But investors expressed interest.

...and word spread fast 🔥🔥🔥

Within 7 days we signed a term sheet with a16z and Bain Capital Ventures.


-- Company --

- Pylon was 2 years and 7 months old
- We had 4.5 years of runway.
- We had only burned $3M of $20.3M previously raised
- Team was 37 people


-- Exact Timeline --

During the weeks leading up to the raise, I started accepting requests for coffee chats at Pylon. I'd chat with investors for 30m where I'd talk about Pylon, hear about their firm, and then talk about our fundraising plans. I'd share ""we're not fundraising but if someone were to give us $30M at $XXXM valuation, we'd be interested"".   

July 4th - We decide we're going to raise, quickly
July 4th-10th - Many investor conversations
July 10th, 8AM - Partner presentation for BCV
July 10th, 1PM - Verbal offer from BCV
July 11th, 10AM - Partner presentation for a16z
July 11th, 11AM - Verbal offer from a16z
July 11th, 11PM - Term sheet signed


-- Fundraising History --

Jan 2023 - Pre-Seed from Y Combinator ($125K raised, $1.79M val) 
Mar 2023 - Seed led by General Catalyst ($3.2M raised, $20M val)
July 2024 - Series A led by a16z ($17M raised, $90M val)
July 2025 - Series B led by BCV & a16z ($31M raised, 🤫 val)

This brought total raised to $51M.


-- Notes --

- Why raise? a) signaling to prospects, customers, and employees and b) there's downside to not raising after getting inbound interest. We asked ourselves ""would we get better terms in 6 months when we expected to raise?"" and the answer was ""no"". Delaying the raise introduced risk if we started to perform worse over the coming months or if market conditions worsened.

- Why only $31M? We didn't need the money and wanted to minimize dilution. 

- We decided to run our Series B process the same way we ran our Series A process: a) build a great company then b) let investors come to you. If you don't need money you have leverage. In comments see one year ago how we raised our previous two rounds.

- Compared to early stage investors (up to Series B), growth stage investors (Series B+) are very different. Early stage think more about potential while growth funds are more focused on actuals and numbers. Part of what we loved about BCV and continuing to work with a16z is that they were able to do both well.


🎥: Advith, Robert, and me ubering over to BCV's office. We didn't need to prepare much for the presentation itself. The work that mattered (building the company) had already been done. Fundraising meant cashing that hard work in.

We're building the first support platform purpose-built for B2B.

Advith Chelikani,"Welcome to the Pylon office 👋

We had originally toured the place as a joke. We were 13 people looking at an office that could fit 100 (!). But the more we joked about it, the more excited we got.

This was THE iconic UserTesting / Postmates / AMCO building right across from the Caltrain station.

It was an office that Advith, Robert, and I had regularly walked by for the past 6 years.

It was right across from the Caltrain station which meant that future employees in South Bay could easily commute up.

And most importantly it felt like a place that our team would be really excited to work out of.

So as we were outgrowing our live/work loft a few blocks away and looking for a new home for Pylon, we quickly negotiated a 3 year lease and signed. 

In the last 9 months since moving in, the team has 2.4x'd to 32 employees, and we're on track to fill it up by the end of the lease.

It was 100% the right decision.


-- Notes --

- Our previous office was 1.9k sqft and we grew in it until 13 people. We infamously both lived and worked out of that office before it got so crowded that our founding AE Sergio had his desk 2 ft away from Advith's mattress

- Our new/current office is 6.97x the size (13,256 sqft)

- If you want to get people excited about working in-person in an office you need to make it a nice place to come into. We were optimizing for that

- We also felt that being close to the Caltrain would allow us to attract a larger in-person team from the rest of the peninsula

- Because we sell to a lot of tech companies, the iconic painted logo on the outside of the building was also a major plus for us. We effectively got two giant billboards on the sides of our building included in our lease price. And there's heavy foot traffic since we're right across from the Caltrain, it's on the Waymo route, and there's a bike path that goes right past it

- I'm believe we're trendsetting with this video. I'm going to bet that by mid-next week we'll see multiple other startups start doing office tours 😂",467.0,48.0,5.0,,,Teacher,Startup/Founder,Humor/Satire,Listicle/Breakdown,Text-only,Welcome to the Pylon office 👋,"Welcome to the Pylon office 👋

Advith Chelikani,"We just launched a new onboarding program. 

It's cohort-style and introduces new hires to different parts of the company.

Some of the week 1 sessions...

- Pylon history (hosted by me)
- Product vision & team overview (Advith and Robert)
- How we demo Pylon (Mana, our head of sales)
- How we use Pylon for support (Jon, head of support)
- How we use Pylon for success (Dan, head of CS)
- Lunch with the founders

We're growing so quickly that team-level onboarding isn't enough anymore. 

So Advith came up with a way for everyone to meet leadership and cross-train on the product from day 1.

P.S. We're hiring!

We have 25+ roles open across all functions: 

- Software engineering
- Product design

Advith Chelikani,"Advith and Robert are the best co-founders I could ask for.

Part of what's made our relationship great is we're aligned on some of the most important high level details of the company:

WHAT - Build a generational company ($10B in 10 years)
HOW - Grindy, low-ego, best idea wins, hire similar people
WHY - Building a startup is the most exciting way to spend time 

This alignment has made decision making incredibly easy.

-- 

Before starting Pylon we were friends.

1/ Advith and Robert met first at Caltech where they were both studying computer science, organizing HackTech (Caltech's hackathon), and competing at puzzle hunts together.

2/ I met Advith through the Kleiner Perkins fellowship (a program for college students who are interested in building startups). Robert had gone through the same program just one year earlier.

3/ After graduation Advith and I lived together for 3 years and became incredibly close.

4/ During the pandemic Advith later started living with Robert and started exploring startup ideas together. I had already been in pivot hell working with others.

4/ A year later Advith, Robert, and I came together and joined forces, and lived together.

Advith Chelikani,"Having FUN at work is underrated.

It's a big reason why people join Pylon.

And I do mean the work itself being fun, not fake-work.

Fun at work can mean....
- building cool stuff
- working with smart people
- debating ideas
- learning a lot
- moving really fast

While anti-fun is...
- useless meetings
- playing politics
- doing throwaway work
- micro-managers
- fixing tech debt
- peers motivated by ego or status

--

Fun is actually the core reason Advith, Robert, and I started Pylon.

Don't get me wrong, we love our product and the customer support category we're in... 

But honestly, we could've worked on anything and had fun doing it.

For us the company building, people, product development, and adventure are what make it fun.  

It's almost like startups are the ultimate, hard-mode board game, where the goal is build a $10B public company in < 10 years.

Ajay Krishnamurthy,"INTRODUCING AI REPORTS [BIG]

Support leaders don't have time to read every ticket.

Now, AI summarizes daily/weekly/monthly customer interactions for you. 

You can make reports for whatever you want...

""Provide a high-level summary of support activity for the week.""

""Which types of tickets take us the longest to reply to?""

""Give me an executive summary of customer health for the month. Include key wins, challenges, and areas of concern.""

""List any tickets that weren't closed properly this week.""

""What are common issues that keep coming up across customers?""

""Summarize any notable escalations or high-priority issues that required special attention.""

""Highlight top moments where customers complimented our team.""

""List the top 5 most common issue categories with a brief description of trends or patterns observed.""

...and they automatically get sent to you in Slack. 

AI reports synthesize information across call recordings, support tickets, CRM data, and any other customer data you have in Pylon.  

Internally, we're even using them across non-support teams (sales, marketing, product) to get customer insights. 

This is a huge release and we can't wait to see what teams build.

👉 Mid is becoming a Senior

Allison Saxon,"FOLLOW FRIDAY - you remember that? From the early days of Twitter.

I'm bringing it back. I just decided.

Some people for you to follow:

1. Allison Saxon - she runs events on our team at Exit Five; she is responsible for Drive, Marketing Leadership Retreat, and all of our workshops, meet-ups and dinners around the U.S. this year.

2. Anthony Blatner - he runs Speedwork, a LinkedIn Ads agency. We met through Exit Five, and Anthony and his team have been running our LinkedIn ads for the last year and we have seen insane results through the combination of organic + Thought Leader ads.

3. Ding Zheng - he runs Eventshark, a great video production company for B2B. We became friends through work and our love of music and fitness. Now he's texting me from China sending verses at 3 AM or giving me a random idea. Good people, and since 2024 he's become so much more than ""the sales rapper.""

4. Jess Cook - recently promoted to VP of Marketing at Vector, OG Exit Five member, and we had a great podcast session yesterday. I got to ask Jess about how they are doing influencer marketing, the ROI of having a podcast at work, and her path from content marketer to VP Marketing. Plus some talk about kids and work and managing it all.

5. Louis Grenier - cancer survivor and marketing genius; reminded me why I love marketing in the first place this week after recording a podcast on how to stand out. And yes, you can even stand out in B2B.

6. Erik Jacobson - founder of Hatch (video/podcast production company), and has been my podcast partner for the last ... five years maybe? Yes podcasting ""works"" yes even in B2B yes you don't need a huge audience to feel something from this. This guy has given me so much wisdom on strategy here, and his company has helped run my podcast for years and i would have quit three times without them. Also just a good person, which means the world.

Those are just some of the people on my mind this week (just looking back at my calendar on this Friday morning and trying to see where the week went)

On the heels of 88 NPS and 77 NPS in the first two years, back for a third year in a row in VERMONT this time in Stowe. September 2026. The best event out there for B2B marketers (according to me). 

Join me and the Exit Five team + hundreds of people who: 

- Work in B2B marketing like you do
- But are also cool people in real life like you are too - with hobbies, interests, families (imagine that!)

The whole thing is: come to learn about marketing and sharpen your skills (we think marketing is a craft) but stay because the people are fun to hang out with too, and we need a bit more connection in real life.

What’s new in 2.0:
- 100+ model integrations (transcription, LLM, TTS)
- Conversation workflows and knowledge bases
- Vapi voices that sound human
- Rock-solid enterprise infrastructure to scale to millions of calls

Amos Bar-Joseph,"GTM Engineers went from non-existent to the most talked about role of 2025. OpenAI, Ramp, Webflow & more are hiring for it. But it turns out it’s not as popular as it seems.

GTM engineers are meant to bring technology and automation to solve hard GTM problems (of which there are many!). I think of GTM engineers as people who can both identify friction points across the buying journey (ICP targeting, ICP pipeline, conversion, CAC, etc.) and then quickly run automated, 1:many experiments to eliminate them.

It’s essentially a growth hire, but focused on a primarily sales-led or sales-assisted funnel rather than a product-led one.

Despite the buzz, I haven’t met many actual GTM engineers yet. There really aren’t a lot of software companies hiring for GTM engineers, either.

Here's what the data shows (see it for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/ezfJ_JJf)

1. There were 128 GTM Engineer jobs posted in the last 3 months. 

Sounds like a lot, but that's 1 for every 14 in RevOps. 1 for every 35 in SalesOps. And 1 for every 92 SDRs (!) -- which nobody is calling a hot job.

2. 45% of those with a GTM engineer title are actually agencies or consultants (shoutout to Amos Bar-Joseph). 

3. The role’s popularity is a far cry from other AI-native jobs like AI engineers, prompt engineers or automation engineers. In fact, it barely registers in Google Trends.

---

Before hiring a GTM engineer, I’d suggest you:

 - Start with an agency or consultant to prove value with a specific use case
 - Redeploy someone internally who has the business context paired with the system knowledge
 - Upskill the existing GTM team and equip them with next-gen tooling
 - Hire a great Head of RevOps (or RevTech) and fully resource their team

Don't miss the full story in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/ezfJ_JJf

Then, let me know what you think. Is GTM engineering online hype or is it still the next hot job?

Anish Kachinthaya,"Introducing... 🔍 AI Knowledge Assistants 🔍

Maintaining your help center is notoriously hard. It contains a LOT of content, your product is constantly changing, and new team members don't have context into your existing content. 

Now, AI Knowledge Assistants will automatically keep your articles up to date. 

Here's how it works...

1/ AI continuously scans your support interactions to identify missing or outdated topics in your knowledge base.

2/ If a topic is missing, AI drafts a brand new article based on how you've responded to past customer issues.

3/ If a topic needs an update, AI drafts edits to an existing article and you can review before publishing.

Instead of knowledge base hell, you now have a help center that writes itself.

Ankit Sobti,"We are entering the age of AI-first APIs 🤖

As engineers, we've built applications for different *consumers* throughout the decades. First for humans (visual interfaces), then for other software (APIs), and now for AI — which is neither human nor traditional software.

AI agents are a weird middle ground: they make API calls like software, but they can also figure out how to use tools, make sense of unstructured data, and make unpredictable mistakes — more like humans.

So today I published a long piece together with Ankit Sobti, CTO of Postman, exploring how all of this changes API design. Here are some key principles:

↳ 🌊 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻 — From human-first UIs to API-first for deterministic software, we're now entering the AI-first era where consumers have both machine precision and human-like understanding.

↳ 💰 𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 — Every byte costs money when processed by LLMs, creating new design tradeoffs between verbosity and clarity that didn't exist before.

↳ ⏱️ 𝗟𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 — AI's multi-second processing times force us to rethink API orchestration, favoring batching, predictive responses, and streaming.

↳ 🔄 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 — AI consumers can retry creatively and work around errors, but only if APIs provide rich, actionable error information.

↳ 📚 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 — Your docs aren't just guides anymore; they directly shape production behavior at scale, requiring the same rigor as code.

We also covered MCP — the emerging standard for AI-API connections — and looked ahead to agent-to-agent communication protocols like Google's A2A.

A lot of this may look like speculation, but this is all very near future, which is being shaped right now in front of us. And this future belongs to systems that can think, adapt, and collaborate. Time to start building them!

Anna Shipman,"How do you translate *engineering* to executives?

Today we published a fantastic guest article by Anna Shipman, CTO at Kooth Digital Health, on something every engineer struggles with: getting buy-in from executives.

Anna brilliantly unpacks this from first principles—explaining how execs think, what they care about, and why the gap exists—and then provides a ton of practical advice on how to bridge it!

The core insight, to me, is that you should think at executives like your *users*. You need to understand their needs, constraints, and context — just like you would for any product you build.

Here are the three top takeaways I learned from Anna:

↳ 🎯 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 — execs think horizontally across the business, optimizing for company-wide impact, so tie your proposals to broad business outcomes. Show how you'll measure impact, always include the ""so what,"" and explain technical concepts clearly.

↳ 📋 𝗕𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘂𝗽 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁 — executives have broader spans of responsibility, meaning less time per area. Lead with a short executive summary stating what decision you need and why. Only include what's crucial for decision-making, and anticipate the questions they'll ask: cost, ROI, alternatives, timing, risks, and how you'll measure success.

↳ 🔀 𝗕𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 — don't expect your CTO or other execs to translate technical details into business language. Do that work yourself by connecting engineering work to the business outcomes they care about.

Anna's article is packed with concrete examples you can use immediately. It's one of those pieces that can genuinely level up your career.

Annie Duke,"How can we make good decisions under uncertainty? 🎲

This is the question I explored with Annie Duke, former world-class poker player, decision science expert, and author of the bestseller book ""Thinking in Bets""

Annie has lived at the intersection of cognitive psychology and high-stakes poker for 20+ years, and developed unique insights into how we can make better decisions when the outcome is unclear.

Here are a few takeaways from our chat:

Most people will start with:
❌ “I think I know what’s happening. The signup page might be down again; didn’t that happen last quarter? Or it could be related to that iOS update we shipped. But it’s also December, and it could just be a weak time for signups. Maybe it will go away on its own…”

And if you don’t finish the investigation quickly, you’ll likely 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗶𝗿𝗰𝗹𝗲𝘀 since you lose track of what you already looked into.

🎯 The solution: Break the problem into an issue tree that follows the MECE principle.

------------------------------------

Yeah, I also have framework fatigue. Too many acronyms to remember, and most of them are useless in the day-to-day. 

Last week, Jordan's and Torsten's article made me reconsider. 

I promise you, it's quite genius:
https://lnkd.in/dRgTyAJp

𝘐𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵, 𝘐'𝘮 𝘥𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭𝘺 𝘲𝘶𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 1 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘰𝘧 5 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦. 𝘈𝘭𝘭 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘑𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘢𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘛𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯!

------------------------------------

𝗠𝗘𝗖𝗘 = 𝗠utually 𝗘xclusive and 𝗖ollectively 𝗘xhaustive.

You break down the problem into non-overlapping segments, that cover 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. 

You start by dividing the possible root causes into high-level groups. Then, you break these groups down further, ensuring every possibility is captured and none of the buckets overlap.

✅ After: “There are 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 for what could be happening: Either something is broken, or the data only makes it look like there’s a problem. If something’s broken, it could be isolated to a specific OS, or affect all devices. And the issue could be at any of the three steps of the signup process, so we’ll check them one by one.”

Don’t rely on luck to find the root cause. The MECE framework gives you a structure that ensures you will find it, and makes it easy to:

1. get everyone on the same page on what’s being investigated.
2. divide the work between different people or teams.

Another benefit of using this structure is that since you have an overview of all possible things you need to check, you can prioritize what to investigate first.

For example, you can see that checking for a data issue or seasonality first can potentially save you a lengthy investigation.

Anton Zaides,"Made it on stage and back alive!

Presenting to over 700 people was both amazing and nerve-wracking.

I spoke about how to 10x your productivity using AI as an engineer, and in short, it's more about WHEN you use it rather than HOW you use it.

You need to understand what AI excels at and what it struggles with. For example, AI will struggle with:

❌ Writing a design doc from scratch (because it doesn't know about your systems)
❌ Creating a presentation deck for you (because it can't tell stories from your perspective)
❌ Fixing a bug across multiple systems (because it can't fit that in the context window)

It MIGHT be good at these things later, once AI knows us and all the context we have in our brain more, but right now, it isn't. 

Instead, use AI either when context is less relevant, or when you can quickly give AI the context it needs to do a good job. Here are a few examples:

• One-off scripts -> It just needs to solve a small problem and save you time from writing the code manually
• Diagramming -> It's great at taking text and transforming it into structure. Get LLMs to convert your paragraphs into mermaid diagrams, then paste those diagrams into your docs
• Answering questions tuned to you -> My Googling has gone down 90% since AI. I always ask AI the question unless if recency matters, since my answer will get tuned specifically for me.

These are just 3 of the 10+ examples I gave in the talk. To access the slides, head to my profile and check my media under the Pinterest experience!

And finally, a big shout out to the fellow creators there that supported me up there (and helped calm my nerves)-- Anton Zaides, Michał Poczwardowski , Gregor Ojstersek , Jade Wilson , Aleksandra Lemańska 🙏 and thank you to to my team and org (Web Platform, Client Foundations, Core Foundations) for supporting me on the deck and process.

Antonia Scheidel,"How do you create good, sustainable, automated processes for your team?

This is pretty much the holy grail of engineering management, and this week we explored it on the podcast with Antonia Scheidel.

Antonia is Director of Engineering at Duolingo, where she rose through the ranks starting as an intern 12 years ago. She's an expert at designing processes that help teams get work done — without becoming bureaucratic nightmares.

↳ 🤖 𝗔𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀 — if you find yourself repeatedly nagging engineers to update JIRA, you're fighting human nature. Automate the copying of data between systems.

↳ 💭 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 — constantly asking people to do (tedious) tasks damages relationships. If something is compromising your ability to coach and mentor, it's worth automating.

An interesting quote from the episode is how Armin builds more tools for himself thanks to using AI tools:

One of the big changes I’m noticing for myself is that I have so many better tools around now. For example, I moved from Terraform to Pulumi for one of the services just to see how that goes.

How do you grow beyond senior as a designer?

I've taken over 6 months to answer this question in the most actionable way in my new book.

Most senior designers do not want to become managers. So I focused on the IC-roles (whether it's called Staff, Lead, or Principal at your organization).

I researched how 50+ companies evaluate designers and employees, including Etsy, Medium, Dropbox, Square, Figma, Zendesk, and Intercom.

I also interviewed 19 product designers on their progression at Figma, Instacart, Dropbox, Etsy, Twitter, and smaller companies.

The book includes actionable techniques that helped other designers get promoted beyond senior: understanding business, finding project opportunities, setting standards, selling ideas, mentoring, increasing visibility, and more.

LaVar Ball hyping up another’s success. 
Steve Wozniak sharing his hiring tips.

They’re the people who built this company with us. The ones who gave us feedback that shaped our roadmap.

1/ Make it zero-lift. Customers shouldn’t have to do anything to enjoy it.
2/ Make it personal. Show you see them as people, not just logos.
3/ Make it aligned. Celebrate in a way that reflects your values. For us, that meant: customers are true partners in the journey.

Ben Horowitz,"If you don’t enjoy your job, and you’re reading this, there IS a WAY out.

This is my favorite book, the Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts.

I want to be tactical, though, you can create your own luck. You can navigate out of your situation.

But to do so requires some advice from the Shawshank Redemption:

Pressure Over Time

Optionality is built in years and months, not days and weeks.

The best optionality is built by becoming an expert, and it’s usually by combining two things (in my case, customer empathy and data w/ AI). I’m the best in the world ONLY when you mix those three things. This is a Ben Horowitz concept, and it’s beautiful.

But the way in which you can get everything that you wanted is to find out what you enjoy doing, and just begin.

Begin by working on it, talking to people about it, building little prototypes, working for people or companies for free to learn it. 

When you do that, you subtly convince the other people that love what you love that you’re in it for passion. 

This is the single thing that people want to hire for, a hunger for the work itself. For its own sake.

Weather it’s gardening, or dental hygiene, or making hats, or ice skating… I promise you there are others out there that feel the way you feel.

Then, once you know them, and once they know your only agenda is to find joy in what you do… they FIND ways to help you. Because they see the joy, they likely feel the joy, and they want other people to feel the joy.

The people I completely avoid building relationships with are those that are money driven, not because it’s bad (I love money), but just because it’s the outcome they seek not the process they love.

That only gets you so far, because you lose your purpose when you make enough money. All that money ever got me, besides freedom from 9-5, is a ridiculously over priced coffee grinder. 

Start working on the side, finding your community, doing the things you feel drawn to… and when you do, you’ll draw in others.

And one day you’ll wake up, and you’ll have so much optionality you won’t know how to chose.

That’s when you really become free, when you get to define your days around your joy, not your job.

Invest daily now, and I promise it will compound over enough time.",79.0,11.0,0.0,,,Teacher,General,Insight/Observation,Story → Twist → Lesson,Text-only,"If you don’t enjoy your job, and you’re reading this, there IS a WAY out.","If you don’t enjoy your job, and you’re reading this, there IS a WAY out.

Birgitta Boeckeler,"How do you create an AI coding workflow that actually works? 🤖

In this week’s podcast episode I had the pleasure of speaking with Birgitta Boeckeler, distinguished engineer and global lead for AI-assisted software delivery at Thoughtworks.

Birgitta's full-time job is to figure out how engineering teams can make the most out of AI — and she shared some fantastic insights about what's working (and what's not) in real-world teams.

Here are a few takeaways from our chat:

↳ 🧠 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗸𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗺 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 — the best teams combine critical thinking about AI's limitations with ambitious experimentation. Both perspectives bring value and you should reward them.

Brian Balfour,"PMF is no longer a binary yes/no (if it ever was). It's more like a treadmill where the speed keeps getting turned up. 

Growth legend Brian Balfour from Reforge joined me & CJ on today's Mostly Growth podcast to talk about the PMF treadmill and what you can do to avoid falling off.

My biggest takeaways:

1. PMF isn't enough. It's only one of ""Four Fits"" to build a successful business. The others: Product Channel fit, Channel Model fit & Model Market fit. AI changes each of these all at once.

2. PMF isn't a milestone that you achieve & move on. It's more like a threshold and that threshold keeps going up over time as a product category matures. 

3. Customer expectations used to rise linearly. New tech shifts w/ AI mean customer expectations can spike exponentially. You need to go faster just to stay in the same place (and even that might not be enough).

4. If you look at PMF as a treadmill, product investments aren't necessarily R&D. They might be more like COGS: necessary to keep serving customers and avoid PMF collapse.

5. As companies ramp up product velocity to stay on the PMF treadmill, product *delivery* is no longer the bottleneck. Product *adoption* is. Companies are releasing features faster than customers can absorb them.

Bryan Cantrill,"If you’re worried about hearing from the media that software development might be ""over"" because of AI, here's some perspective.

Bryan Cantrill has had an incredible career: worked on operating systems at Sun, built an AWS competitor at Joyent (an AWS competitor), and is now building a new type of ""server computer"" at Oxide Computer Company (where he is cofounder and CTO. I love how amazing Oxide is, and did a deepdive on them a while back: https://lnkd.in/eZMBSBaG)

When he started out, in 1992, conventional wisdom was that software in the US is over, because all of it will be outsourced - heck, it's happening. No point in graduating in this field. It was a rational argument at the time, and those predicting it truly believed it.

Looking back, software development was just getting started, and many golden decades would follow.

What I love about Bryan is that he got into the field because of his clear love for solving problems. We talked for well over an hour on the podcast, and it was an incredibly interesting conversation. Watch or listen to it here:

My favorite part of the episode is when Bryan talked about how the ""Dotcom Bust"" was much better for innovation than the ""Dotcom Boom:""

“A boom can get you to care about things that you actually don’t care about. This is because in a boom, everyone is so financially driven that it’s hard not to become financially driven!

But [the financial side] is actually not why I got into this. So during the bust, I was definitely able to put a meal on my table and a roof over my head. But [the Bust] was a reminder about what’s important.

We did better technical work in the Bust than in the Boom. I think that’s because in the Bust it was like: okay, now we really have to focus. We have fewer resources. These fewer resources actually force more creativity!

So all of the things that we did, certainly speaking at Sun and system software, so ZFS filesystem] and DTrace [dynamic tracing framework] and Service Manager Facility [unified service management framework in Solaris 10], all these things that were really revolutionary for the operating system. All of these [innovations] happened in this same kind of post-Bust period of time, from 2001 to 2005.”",104.0,14.0,7.0,,,Contrarian,Engineering/Technical,Contrarian/Challenge,Statement → Commentary,Text-only,"How have servers and the cloud evolved in the last 30 years, and what might be next? Bryan Cantrill has been at the thick of the industry since the Do","How have servers and the cloud evolved in the last 30 years, and what might be next? Bryan Cantrill has been at the thick of the industry since the Do",,,,dataset_alexis_dataset,,,,

CJ Gustafson,"Quick poll: have you ever voluntarily shown up for a panel?

I don't know about you, but I keep tricking myself into thinking I should go. And I always regret it.

At a typical panel (a) everyone agrees with each other, (b) nobody wants to say something controversial, and (c) the best speakers get about 5 mins of talking in a 30 min session, so they never get below the surface.

If you agreed to join or moderate a panel, here's some (unsolicited) advice:

1. Pick one speaker per question. Not everyone needs to answer.
2. Find a POV where you *disagree* with 80%+ of the room. That's the most fun to hear about.
3. Stop talking about strategy, start talking about specifics.
4. Bring one tactical piece of advice that a listener can apply to their job in the next 24 hours. It doesn't matter if it's in the weeds (actually, that's a good thing.)
5. Maybe pay CJ to show up? If he doesn't do panels, how else will he pay for that Wonder playzone membership?

Caleb S.,"Introducing Account Intelligence

Turn customer data → signals → action.

The result is fewer blind spots, faster reactions, and proactive workflows that drive retention and revenue.

This was previously difficult for two reasons:

1. Scattered customer data across calls, tickets, usage
2. Conversational data is unstructured 

With Account Intelligence, Pylon solves both. You can now centralize your customer data and allow you to build scalable, proactive workflows around them.

Some of our favorite signal → action workflows identify:

→ Expansion opportunities
→ Churn risks
→ Sentiment shifts

...and all of this can be setup by non-technical users with no code.

There's a lot to this release, but high level the new product changes include:

𝟭/ 𝗔𝗜 𝗙𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱𝘀
Tell AI what field you want to track across accounts (e.g. ""Interest in AI Upsell"") and AI will automatically populate it based on the information from all of your Pylon data. 

𝟮/ 𝗔𝗜 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀
Notebooks provide in-depth context on your accounts with customizable blocks, including AI summaries. Say you noticed an account is tagged as ""churn risk"" in your AI Field. You can click into the account to see all the details that AI has summarized across calls and messages.

𝟯/ 𝗔𝗜 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘀
You can create custom formulas that work off of numeric data (e.g. health scores or usage). Or you can describe what you want in plain English, and our Formula Copilot will automatically generate a working calculation instead of you having to write it yourself. 

𝟰/ 𝗔𝗜 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘂𝗽𝘀 + 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀 & 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀
AI automatically extracts action items from call recordings and creates tasks in your shared customer portal. Group tasks into projects for onboarding, expansion, or migration. Both teams and customers can track progress.
 

This is a massive release and we're excited for you to try it.

And as always remember...

B2B Support = Pylon

I have many *work friends* on the internet, but I rarely get to see them face to face. In fact, I spend most of my days alone in my *cave* writing newsletter articles 😄

So it was incredible to meet so many of them all in the same place — and most of them for the first time. Shout-outs to Camille, Laura, Patrick, Lena (we literally bumped into each other in the elevator), Maria, Claire, Gergely, and all the others I met who I am inevitably forgetting, for making these days special.  

A special shout-out to Charity, who made me incredibly happy by bringing on stage “In Praise of Normal Engineers” — the article she published on Refactoring. She did an amazing job (linking it in the comments in case you missed it) and it was just the perfect way to close the event!

Also, to comply with my duties as a writer, I took *a ton* of notes during the event, and I will publish a write-up with the ideas I liked the most in the next week or so!

Casey Newton,"An anon poster pretended to be an UberEats software engineer, and baited the internet to believe something completely false:

This Reddit thread claiming that a ""major food delivery app"" is pocketing priority fees and driver benefit fees blew up a few days ago: https://lnkd.in/eFG7M3Vr

It got the attention of journalist Casey Newton (at Platformer.) Casey reached out, and started chatting with this person over Signal. He asked for evidence of the claims, and got a photo of the UberEats badge of this ""whistleblower"" and a 14-page supposedly internal document uncovering damning things.

Except the badge is absolutely fake and AI-generated, as is the document! I know, because I worked at Uber, still meet with people who work at Uber and the badge has not changed, and looks nothing like the one on the photo. There is no ""UberEats"" badge; it is not green; the title is obviously not on the badge (if it was, a new badge would need to be issued on every promotion). (I would upload my own badge that I still have - but now I worry that doing so would make it easier for the next troll to create a more realistic badge, and eventually fool a less careful journalist!)

Casey figured out he is being baited and fed AI-generated documents, and confronted this poster: who then simply deleted their Signal account. A lot longer post by Casey with all the details, and the fake 14-page, AI-generated document: https://lnkd.in/euQGqV6e

The problem is how it took this baiter a few minutes to generate plausible sounding lies, but hours for a journalist to figure out it's all fake... and the lie keeps spreading online. As Casey put it so well:

""The rapid spread of the whistleblower’s post illustrated yet another maxim they taught us in J-school: A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on. With AI tools at their fingertips, hoaxsters can make those lies travel even faster.""

(All other claims were also false, as confirmed by Uber and DoorDash. If there was a whisper of truth in it, you can bet real whistleblowers would come out: there are thousands of people working at each company, and even more ex-employees who would say something if there was an ounce of truth in it...)",1049.0,75.0,35.0,,,Contrarian,Engineering/Technical,Contrarian/Challenge,Statement → Commentary,Text-only,"An anon poster pretended to be an UberEats software engineer, and baited the internet to believe something completely false:","An anon poster pretended to be an UberEats software engineer, and baited the internet to believe something completely false:

Cassie Young,"AI-native companies have been shattering growth records. The elephant in the room: what Cassie Young calls an impending ""gross retention apocalypse"".

It becomes nearly impossible to sustain hypergrowth when you have a larger and larger install base that walks out the door each month. There’s a term for this: burning through your TAM.

I analyzed data from ChartMogul on 3,500 software companies, mapping out companies based on two dimensions: annualized net revenue retention (NRR) from September 2025 and year-on-year revenue growth.

What the data shows:

1. On the whole there’s a very strong correlation between NRR and long-term growth. 

2. Early-stage startups can grow fast (200%+) even with NRR below 40%. (Many B2C/self-serve AI startups fall into this bucket.)

3. Yet low retention companies are at extremely high risk of growth going in reverse; three times as many are shrinking compared to growing quickly.

I'm not sure if it's too late for a 2026 prediction. If not, here's one to add: there's a resurgence in investment in CS & professional services as buyers shift from AI experimentation >>> consolidating around a handful of preferred AI partners.

Charchris Sloan,"Now is the time to upskill. Stop thinking about how AI will eliminate your role and start thinking about how it will elevate it. Jordan Cutler’s advice? Diversify your skillset:

“Develop your people and AI skills, use AI to solve problems and ensure you have the people skills to work with *anyone*”.

He advises entry-level engineers to follow the 3 E’s framework:

- Education: Evolve your understanding of the foundations, for example, embeddings and AI's probabilistic nature and randomness. There are AI courses on Udemy that can help.

- Exposure: Curate your “information diet” and read content from credible experts (e.g., Ruben Hassid), whether in newsletters or following them on LinkedIn.

- Experience: Start building products. AI can guide you to an output, and you’ll quickly understand whether your code has worked.

For more tenured engineers, he recommends using AI to improve communication and design better systems:
- Use tools like v0 to get to a higher fidelity prototype with minimal effort
- Use tools like WriteEdge and @chatPRD to discuss/debate ideas

In summary: use AI to reduce the “time to value” for a product

Chris Lattner,"8 interesting learnings from my conversation with Chris Lattner about how he created Swift, Mojo - and before all of these, LLVM:

1. Demonstrate business value inside a large company, first! 

Apple hired Chris to work on LLVM (a new type of compiler, created by Chris), because they were frustrated with GCC. However, it took Chris some friendly advice from his manager, and he “got the vibe that, after a year, if Apple’s not using in some product, then they’ll ask to start doing something else.” This realization pushed Chris to find the first team to be the internal customer to LLVM: which was the OpenGL team, where he was able to “do something very small that actually had value.” After this, more teams inside Apple onboarded to LLVM.

2. Chris built Swift in secret, for more than a year. 

For a year and a half, Chris built Swift on nights and weekends, while running a 40+ person (and growing!) team during the day. Talk about believing in the value of your side project! 

3. Apple leadership was initially not enthusiastic about Swift. 

When Chris showed off an early version of Swift to leadership, the response was “why would we want a new language? Objective C is what made the iPhone successful.”

4. Chris’s whole career led him to the crossover of compilers, languages, AI and hardware.

In the “1.0” phase on his career, he built developer tools (compilers and languages) for software engineers at Apple. In the “2.0” phase he worked on AI at Tesla (Autopilot) and Google (TensorFlow and TPUs), and then worked on hardware (RISC-V CPUs at SiFive). At his current startup, all of these past experiences combine: Modular builds tools to make programs portable across GPUs (and CPUs, and TPUs).

5. Why Mojo is both so readable, but also so performant:

Mojo took a lot of inspiration from Python for readability, but also added features to make the language be more performant: for example, compressed floating point formats (the ability to reduce the precision of floating point numbers, by using types like Float16), and metaprogramming capabilities like parameters for compile-time calculations.

6. How Modular hires new grads: 

They look for folks who have intellectual curiosity, are fearless in getting things done, and it’s a positive sign if they’ve contributed to open source projects before.

7. What Chris is most proud of: helping others start creating software. 

Something Chris still remembers is how, after Swift became widespread, people stopped him on the street, thanking him that they could become iOS developers using this easier to onboard language.

8. Chris’ success looks a lot different than many people from the outside imagine.

As Chris put it: “I don’t expect people to understand me. What usually happens is that these projects over time, they grow and they get to the point where suddenly it clicks and suddenly people start to understand.”

I'm talking about Team Squads.

Spotify introduced the idea in 2014, and it involves creating mini-teams, each with the autonomy to manage its own projects as if it were a self-contained startup.

The Spotify model has been extensively discussed.

It comes with many benefits:

Curtis Einsmann,"A common mistake of developers new to a ""tech lead"" role: trying to perform every code review. They're concerned that if they don't, something will break.

But reviewing every Pull Request isn't feasible, and doesn't scale.

So, what should you do instead? 6 tips:

1️⃣ Enhance your delivery systems outside of code review.

Strengthen your release pipelines with tests, monitoring and rollback. This will help to prevent, detect and mitigate defects.

2️⃣ Document code review processes.

Team members should be aware of the expected size, scope and structure for each PR. Add automated checks for testing and approval.

3️⃣ Establish paradigms.

Introduce design patterns and structure to the codebase, that others can leverage and build on top of.

4️⃣ Integrate automated tools.

Use linters and formatters to ensure consistent style. Set up automated static code analysis.

5️⃣ Teach your team to review effectively.

Emphasize the importance of kindness, clarity, and thoroughness. Identify when blocking is or isn't appropriate.

6️⃣ Be aware of what's being shipped to production.

Slack/GitHub integration works well. Know when to scan a pull request, and when to do a thorough dive.

🔑 Remember: You can't write and review all the code for your team. If you could, hiring others would be pointless.

💡 Instead: put your team in position to ship better software, faster.

Dan Murphy,"I’m excited to share an important update about the leadership structure at Exit Five.

After two years running our business as COO, I’ve promoted Dan Murphy to CEO. 

My role as Founder & Owner does not change; more on that in a bit. 

This promotion isn’t a shift in how we operate — it’s a recognition of the role Dan already plays in our business and a critical step in preparing us to scale and maximize our potential in the years ahead.

In the book Traction they talk about the ideal pairing between the Visionary (Founder) and the Integrator (Operator).

That describes the partnership Dan and I have well:

• Visionaries are creative, strategic, restless, full of ideas, often bald - and honestly a bit dangerous without the right counterpart. They are known to start fires and run.

• Integrators bring structure and process. They turn chaos into clarity. They run the business, manage teams, keep the trains moving, and allow the Visionary to focus where they are most valuable. That’s exactly what Dan has done since joining two years ago.

Dan has pushed me. He challenges every late night and weekend idea. He puts out the fires that I start. He sweats every dollar we spend. And he has consistently held a higher bar for what this company can be. Even if it's sometimes annoying and I want to yell at him :) That's what we need. That's the partner you want.

Exit Five has gone from “Dave’s cute little solo business” to a real company with real scale because of the structure, stability, and leadership he has brought to us.

His growth over the last two years — from VP Marketing in his last job to a true operator today — has been incredible to watch.

Like in baseball free agency, you get paid for the job you've already done. So this title as CEO reflects who Dan has become and what our company needs for the future. 

We have big plans for 2026, 2027, and beyond. 

I am working harder on this than I have on anything in a while and having the most fun of my career.  Splitting up the CEO and Founder roles will make us all more successful for the future.

My superpowers are vision, content, product, and strategy. Working on copy, hooks, headlines, positioning, storytelling, and training our team to do the same. 

The best role for me at Exit Five is to be editor-in-chief and raise the bar on our ideas, our content, products, and the way we show up in the market. That’s where I can create the most value.

This move gives us the foundation we need for a more ambitious Exit Five — one with more impact, more innovation, and more opportunity for our team.

Please join me in congratulating Dan on a well-earned promotion to CEO of Exit Five. 

This is an amazing milestone for our little business, and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.

NOTE: He started wearing the fanny pack before becoming CEO. But that's how I knew it was meant to be.

Also, this means I am now in full-time #FounderMode for those keeping score at home.

Dan Murphy,"Happy (official) two year Exit Five anniversary to my guy and our COO Dan Murphy.

In the book Traction and the EOS framework, they talk about the ideal leadership pairing between the Visionary (founder) and an Integrator (the operator).

That framework is exactly what makes Dan and I work so well together.

Most entrepreneurs fall into the Visionary category: creative, strategic, restless (yep), starting fires everywhere (can confirm), big on ideas, lower on follow-through (my bad).

Integrators:

- Bring structure
- Turn chaos into clarity
- Run the business
- Manage teams
- Keep the trains running on time
- Free the Visionary to do Visionary things

Candidly, Dan can be a complete pain in my ass - but that is exactly what I need. 

Dan pushes me. He sweats every dollar we spend. He questions every late night idea we have. He has even mastered the art of putting out every fire that I start.

This is the the reason Exit Five has become a real business, a real company, and something that has already outgrown my name. It's also a profitable growth machine that is making a real impact on thousands of people around the world (I have the receipts in my Apple Notes; the impact goes well beyond B2B marketing).

Dan will tackle any problem, big or small. He's on calls with my accountant, talking to our lawyer, he's interviewing candidates, he's fixing landing pages, he's coding, he's asking me why I spent $25 on a Jimmy John's sandwich at the airport. 

But more importantly he knows what we *can* be and pushes me to raise the bar. Have a high f-ing bar is one of our core values now.

Before this I used to brag about how little I was working, and now I know why: I did not have a clear purpose. I was alone. 

That has all changed in the last two years and I can confidently say that I'm in the prime of my career and we have a great business with product market fit because this guy took my call two years ago. 

His comp was heavily weighted on performance in that first year too. He took a bet on himself, smashed the goals (turns out we're both competitive) and it's be game on ever since.

He's also a good person (imagine that!) A great Dad. Husband. And the guy I would call in a pinch, for anything.

He's also grown - big time. Maturing. Evolving from a VP Marketing to a true COO. And I know there's more to come. 

Thanks for 2 great years Dan. I hope we don't have a public falling out one day where we're talking shit about each other on Twitter!!! <3

Please go follow him on LinkedIn if you are not already.

PS. We celebrated by playing TPC Scottsdale two weeks ago after the E5 team offsite and had a blast. I think it was $500 per person for 18 holes, but we put it on the Ramp card because it's a write off!

Dana Lawson,"One of the ugliest trends in our industry in recent years is the pushback on the value of diversity in engineering teams. 

Also, it has become an extremely charged topic. It feels hard to discuss it without falling into all kinds of partisanship.

So I'll try to be practical.

What is diversity in a team? People immediately think about genders and ethnicities, but it's much more:

↳ It's people from different levels (juniors & seniors)
↳ It's different age groups
↳ It's introverts vs extroverts
↳ It's people with kids vs no kids
↳ It's movie guys vs TV show guys

At its core, diversity just means having people around you who are different from you. Who think different from you. This is valuable because we all have biases and blind spots — and the more similar we are, the more likely it is that we have the same ones.

In a diverse team, people hold each other to higher standards. This is absolutely obvious to anyone who has been lucky to work on a team like that, but it's (somewhat understandably) hard to grasp for those who have not.

To many, this looks like a moral argument — but it is a very practical one.

The most effective argument in favor of diverse teams is not some ethical obligation that companies should match the composition of society—that's at least debatable—is that 𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀, 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗽.

So how diverse should your team be?

Your team exists to serve your users, so my rule of thumb, which I stole from Dana, is that you want a team whose composition at least reflects that of your community of users. You create better products by better relating to your users.

Do you serve a global, diverse community of people? The best way to serve their needs is to craft a team that reflects that. Which is just common sense.",34.0,0.0,4.0,,,Contrarian,Engineering/Technical,Contrarian/Challenge,Contrast Format,Text-only,One of the ugliest trends in our industry in recent years is the pushback on the value of diversity in engineering teams.,"One of the ugliest trends in our industry in recent years is the pushback on the value of diversity in engineering teams.

Mid-level engineers can use AI to produce the output of a senior engineer. A senior engineer + AI = a Staff engineer, and so on and so forth.

Darragh C.,"“The default path was failure” — this is one of the first things that Darragh C., CTO of Intercom, told me during our interview about their AI transition.

Without radical action, Intercom would have been swept by new AI-native startups.

To avoid that, they literally bet the house on AI, launching Fin, a separate AI agent product, and directing most resources to it. 

They are also completely reinventing how their engineering team works, as Darragh months ago publicly set the ambitious target of *doubling* the PR throughput per engineer. How is that going? We explored this in depth!

And much more! We discussed how, contrary to doom stories, many junior engineers are actually thriving, how new AI models are bringing diminishing returns, and more.

Dave Kellogg,"[New from Exit Five] First annual B2B Marketing Leadership Retreat in Scottsdale, AZ.

We're hosting a 2 day retreat for 100 B2B marketing leaders. 

March 18-20, 2026. Audience is 100 CMOs, VPs, Heads of Marketing.

Keynote from Dave Kellogg on how to become the CMO that everyone wants to work with, and I'm hosting Zoom CMO Kimberly Storin for a fireside chat.

But the main focus is on building peer to peer relationships with the real people who are doing the thing you're doing. 

Put down the ChatGPT app and let's come hangout in-person. It's all about who's in the room. 

Besides those two speakers, everything is peer led workshops (someone will teach, you pick the group you want to join) small group sessions (we'll match you up), meals together, spa, hike, play golf. 

I don't see this is a ""conference"" - it’s a reset. A chance to step out of the day to day and actually breathe for a minute. Think bigger about the things you're working on. Get unstuck and inspired.

We visited the property two weeks and it’s amazing. Feels like a proper exec retreat if I were to picture what one would look like. And it's the perfect spot for a much needed time away to regroup with other marketing leaders.

➡️  Tickets are on sale now at the link below and we’re running special early bird pricing from now until December 1st. So if you're ready to plan Q1 travel, grab a ticket now and catch a price break:

Dave Steer,"[This week] I'm hosting a conversation on AI and SEO with three marketing leaders that have actual receipts from the past year. Details below.

Each month we host Exit Five Live sessions (don't you dare call it a webinar) open to anyone to dive into a hot topic in B2B marketing. 

Wednesday the session is all about AI + SEO.

AI has created a whole new game for SEO and a lot of brand perception is being shaped outside of channels marketers directly control.

So what’s a CMO to do? Where should you invest? What changes need to be made to the current playbook? 

Respectfully: how is this any different than traditional SEO? It's not the same thing?

We'll discuss...

My guests:

- Dave Steer (CMO at Webflow; website experience platform)
- Marcy Comer (CMO at EagleView; they do aerial insights / property intelligence)
- Clare Schmitt (VP Marketing at Piedmont Global; they help companies expand internationally) 

So we're coming at this from a bunch of different angles and industries.

Join us Wednesday January 21 and we'll cover:

You will learn:

- How to think about AEO at the leadership level
- What to focus on in the next 90 days
- The risks of ignoring AI-driven discovery
- How to gauge AEO maturity, from basic visibility to real authority

David Chang,"As a $250M company, this is when I knew I needed a VP of Finance:


Early on, I could “vibe” my way through numbers.
Mistakes were small and fixable fast.

But once I was debating:
- efficiency vs speed
- ramp time vs headcount
- which parts of the roadmap deserved people now vs later
I knew we needed a VP of Finance. 

Without accurate data and forecasts, I couldn’t answer:
- ”What’s the lowest price floor we can set without hurting the business?”
- ”How do we forecast burn when we’re making headcount or product bets that won’t pay off for years?”
- “How many people should we actually hire?”

When I screened for a VP of Finance, I looked for two things:
1/ Ability: could they wrangle messy data?
2/ First principles thinking: could they get to the root of the issue?

In the take-home, 
I gave candidates a real data room.

I asked them to answer questions like:
- ""How much should we commit to X vendor?""
- ""Can you forecast our 2025 sales targets?""

I had them walk through assumptions, tradeoffs, and what data was missing.  

David Chang stood out.
He could take unstructured data and turn it into real decisions,

But more importantly,
he optimized for the company’s actual objectives.

He recognized when flexibility, risk management, or strategic leverage
mattered more than a perfectly precise forecast.

David Gu,"BREAKING NEWS: We just raised our $38M Series B, led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with HubSpot Ventures and Salesforce Ventures joining the round.

When David Gu and I started Recall.ai, the idea was simple: make meeting data accessible as an API.

Three years later, over 2,000 companies - including HubSpot, ClickUp, and Apollo - have launched AI copilots, agents, sales tools, and more on top of us.

Recall.ai is the API for meeting recording. From Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Slack Huddles, to desktop. 
We give developers one reliable infrastructure layer to capture, store, and analyze the data that powers their products.

This milestone is only possible because of the builders who trusted us early, the team who put in the work, and the partners who believed in this vision.

David Gu,"Day 397: They ghosted me AGAIN.
Day 422: Landed for $580K.

The CTO canceled at the last minute. For the 7th time.
14 months of work. 22 stakeholders. 3 different “champions.”

David Gu poured me a new cup of tea. “When do we call it?”

The numbers didn’t lie. We’d spent 118 hours on this prospect. Our runway was shrinking.
Other deals needed attention.

But something kept nagging at me. Our API usage from their pilot was still active. Growing, actually.

They weren’t uninterested. They were drowning in their own process.

That night I made a decision: No more chasing.

I drafted a final email: “We need to conclude this opportunity by month-end - either as a partner or we’ll reallocate these resources.”

Then added our non-negotiables:
1/ Executive sponsor required on next call
2/ 14-day maximum evaluation period
3/ No more extensions without commitment

My finger hovered over send. This could kill the deal for good.

I clicked anyway.

5 AM the next day, the CTO called.

”Apologies for the delays. We need your API. Let’s fix this.”

That deal closed 422 days after our very first call.

The experience completely changed how we sell at Recall.ai .

We stopped allowing unlimited pilots and set clear success criteria.
We started qualifying opportunities based on timeline, not just fit.
We began walking away from deals with no path to close.

Most importantly, we stopped viewing delays as disinterest.

The results were immediate: win rate tripled, sales cycles shortened, and for the first time, we could forecast with actual confidence.

If they need your product, delays aren’t disinterest. They’re process friction.

David Gu,"Five years ago, I was weeks from shutting down. Now we’re building the infrastructure layer AI products run on.

Every day, millions of sales calls, hiring interviews, and team meetings happen. Critical decisions get made. Problems get solved. Insights emerge.

Then it’s gone. Forever.

We write everything down.
Emails, docs, Slack messages. 
But the most important conversations disappear the moment they end.

I couldn’t let that go.

David Gu and I started building Recall.ai because we believed conversation data would become as critical as databases or cloud storage. People thought we were crazy.

“Why would developers need an API for meeting recordings?”

Today, over 2000 companies have their answer. HubSpot uses us to power their AI meeting recordings. ClickUp built their notetaker on our infrastructure.

We raised a $38M Series B led by Bessemer, with HubSpot Ventures and Salesforce Ventures joining the round.

But here’s what I’m most proud of: we solved a problem that didn’t have a name three years ago.

David Gu,"I redesigned a website for $3,000. It turned into a $10M+ company.


Six years ago, I took a freelance gig for a struggling startup.

The founder, David Gu , was brilliant, but his product was failing.

What impressed me wasn't his idea. It was how he handled it.

When I showed him the proof it wouldn’t work, he didn’t argue. He just nodded and said, ""So what should we build instead?""

That question changed everything.

We started whiteboarding after hours. Brainstorming new directions.

Two months later, we shut down his original startup and became co-founders.

We launched Perfect Recall (a meeting notetaker).

For two years, we chased PMF. Built features users liked but wouldn’t pay for. Got excited about metrics that didn’t translate to revenue. Pitched at Demo Day and silence.

Six pivots. Minimal traction. And now, six months of runway left.

One night, after spending the entire day fixing a broken Google Meet integration, David and I sat in silence.

Then he said:
”We can’t be the only ones dealing with this…”

The breakthrough wasn't adding more features. It was realizing that the infrastructure we built was the product.

We shut down Perfect Recall and launched Recall.ai — an API for accessing meeting data across Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and more.

And suddenly, everything shifted.

The same customers who ghosted us were now asking for contracts.

Six pivots and four years later, we finally had product-market fit.

What made the difference wasn't the perfect idea. It was the right partnership.

David never treated this like a side project. I never had an exit plan.

When everyone else saw failure, we saw iteration.

The journey to $10M ARR wasn't about finding the right product immediately. It was about finding someone you can fail with repeatedly until you succeed.

What's something you've built that turned out completely different from what you first imagined?

It was our 100th user research interview.
The call had gone just like the last 99.

Polite. Interested.
But when it came time to ask if they’d pay…silence.

My first startup, Perfect Recall (meeting notetaker), was ramen profitable. Not growing, but stable.
And I’d thrown it away chasing this idea in the user research space that clearly wasn’t working.

My co-founder, David Gu , walked into the room.
“How’d it go?”

I didn’t even look up.
“Another no.”

We sat there in silence for a few seconds.
Then I said:
”What if we just built the API?”

For nearly two years, we’d spent 4-5 hours every day wrestling with meeting data infrastructure.
Zoom APIs. Transcription services. Platform-specific bugs.

I’d googled “Google Meet API” so many times I could recite the results.

But it felt too… niche. Too small.

David nodded.
“You mean for meeting data? I would pay money to not deal with it.”

That’s when it clicked.

The problem didn’t feel important enough because we were focused on market size instead of pain.
But solving a deep pain for real people is the always the best first step.

David Spitz,"This data is INSANE. And proves the “Growth at All Costs” era is over. 

Quite literally billions of dollars in enterprise value driven by how cost-efficient your go-to-market (GTM) is. Let’s check it out 👇 

First - yes, Growth matters. And has one of the largest impacts on TTM Revenue Multiple and Enterprise Value. 

But now Efficiency also matters - how much it costs to grow. Which is most heavily impacted by the ROI of the entire go-to-market GTM investment (40-60% of total revenue invested in GTM). 

__

So here’s the metric you need to monitor: GTM EFFICIENCY %

GTM Efficiency % = [TTM Total GTM Expenses] / [TTM Total Net New ARR]  * 100%

Put simply, GTM Efficiency % means how much did you spend on GTM to generate $1 in Net New ARR. 

(The smaller, the better) 

Net New ARR = New Logo + Expansion - Contraction - Churn 

Total GTM Expenses = Sales, Marketing, SDRs, Operations, Leadership, Admin, Training, Technology, Data, etc. 

But this number has been getting a lot bigger since 2021 in both the public markets and private markets. And it's decimating enterprise value in the process. 

__

So here’s the thing you need to know: SaaS companies with better GTM Efficiency are valued significantly higher (as a multiple of TTM Revenue). 

GTM Efficiency > 250% -> 3.6X median revenue multiple
GTM Efficiency 175% - 250% -> 6.4X median revenue multiple
GTM Efficiency < 175% -> 10X median revenue multiple

Wow, companies with *efficient* GTM are valued 2X-3X more than SaaS companies with demonstrably inefficient GTM. 

And that makes a difference of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to shareholders. 

CEOs, CFOs, and Investors take note! 
__

The “Growth at All Costs” era is over. 

Drive hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in increased enterprise value in 2025 by hitting your growth target while also maintaining target GTM Efficiency < 175%.

David Spitz,"B2B SaaS revenue growth rates have slowed by over 50% in the past 2 years. 

And CAC Payback periods have skyrocketed by nearly 100% in the same period. 

These two effects combined put massive pressure on core financial metrics, business profitability, and enterprise value. 

The root cause of this is Go-To-Market Bloat (GTM Bloat) where B2B companies invest significant money in Sales & Marketing and do not get the appropriate return on investment.

Sales & Marketing is by far the largest expense on a B2B company P&L - on average 40%-60% of total revenue; and 2-3X more than they spend on Product Development, Engineering, and R&D combined.

GTM Bloat occurs across the entire go-to-market, including People, Programs, Process, and Technology.

(1) People - Too many headcount on each GTM team, caused by outdated financial planning models, in addition to the overspecialization of roles on GTM teams (SDR, MDR, Solutions Consultant, AE, Onboarding Manager, CSM, AM, etc.). Or 90-person Marketing team that should actually be 35 people. Average sales quota attainment of ~40% is another clear indicator of headcount bloat.

(2) Programs - This mostly happens in the Marketing budget. B2B companies dramatically overspend on large scale events and digital performance marketing - up to 15% of total revenue - and do not get anywhere close to an appropriate measurable ROI on these significant expenses.

(3) Processes - Teams, meetings, reporting cadences to support programs that don’t work. SDRs to follow up with “leads” and get a meeting less than 1% of the time. Inefficient processes create significant bloat especially when operated at scale.

(4) Technology - Buying an ABM tool for $200k per year and barely using it. So much bloated headcount increases license & seat costs for all SaaS subscriptions by 2-3X. Too many $100k+/year point solutions used by 1 department or team and not integrated or essential to the full GTM.

__

Solving GTM Bloat is the #1 opportunity in a B2B company today to increase enterprise value. This is now a CEO, CFO, and Board Level issue.

Eliminating GTM expenses that do not provide appropriate ROI could increase EBITDA by 20% or more.

Restructuring the existing investments in GTM to deliver the appropriate effectiveness could increase growth rates by up to 2X (e.g. from 18% to 36% YoY).

Or more than likely, the solution is a mix of both of these - eliminating low ROI expenses to improve EBITDA and doubling down on strategies that are already working to create breakthroughs in growth rate.

Dennis Pilarinos,"Tribal knowledge is engineering teams' biggest bottleneck.

Last week I spoke with Dennis Pilarinos, founder and CEO of Unblocked, on the podcast, and this quote stuck with me. 

Dennis spent his *whole career* working on dev tools: from Director roles at Microsoft and Amazon, to founding BuddyBuild and selling it to Apple, to now building Unblocked, which is one of the few AI dev tools that's specifically NOT about coding.

Here are a few takeaways from our chat:

↳ 🎯 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 — developers spend most of their time searching for the right information, not writing code. One customer's top engineer once spent 5 days writing just 12 lines of code!

↳ 🧠 𝗛𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮 𝗯𝗮𝗱 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 — ""there's no such thing as a bad answer from an LLM, it's just a bad question."" We're learning to use these tools just like we learned to use Google effectively.

↳ 🔨 𝗔𝗜 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗻𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗴𝘂𝗻, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮 𝗷𝗼𝗯 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 — when construction workers got nail guns, they didn't work less - they built more buildings. AI tools let developers tackle more ambitious projects.

↳ 📚 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝘆 𝗯𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗱 — why write docs when AI can extract knowledge from code, PRs, and Slack conversations? Semantic search beats traditional documentation.

↳ 🚀 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺-𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 — imagine AI that not only triages CI failures but proposes and implements fixes. We're moving from writing code to orchestrating intelligent systems.

Dennis Pilarinos,"If AI can understand code without docs, and can write better docs than most humans... what's the point of documentation anymore? 🤔

Today I partnered with Dennis Pilarinos (founder of Unblocked, former Director at Microsoft/Amazon) to explore this question. And the answer is surprisingly complex.

I believe we are witnessing a fundamental shift in engineering knowledge. AI is making some docs obsolete while making others more critical than ever.

The magic is understanding the 𝗪𝗵𝘆/𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁/𝗛𝗼𝘄 pyramid:

↳ 🧠 𝗧𝗵𝗲 ""𝗪𝗵𝘆"" — business context, decisions, constraints. This is 100% a human domain and more valuable than ever. AI can't infer this by looking at the code.

↳ 📐 𝗧𝗵𝗲 ""𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁"" — system design, features, workflows. This is where humans and AI will *collaborate* the most.

↳ ⚙️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 ""𝗛𝗼𝘄"" — implementation details, runbooks, API docs. AI can largely own and auto-generate this layer.

The problem is: today most teams have it backwards — we spend 80% effort documenting HOW (which AI can largely generate) and 20% on WHY (which only humans can provide).

Time to flip that ratio.

So, the future is not static wikis — it's AI assistants that understand your entire engineering context and answer exactly what you need to know, right now. But we need to be intentional about *which* context we still need to record and provide, as humans, and which instead will become AI-generated.

Dr Milan Milanović,"There's one thing that literally saved my a** multiple times in my Engineering career.


It's Tech Specs. 

Many don't like to write this kind of document because it's actually time-consuming and comes with multiple challenges.

But it also brings a myriad of benefits:

💪 Clarity of Vision: Tech Specs ensure everyone is on the same page.

📢 Better Communication: bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

🚨 Risk Mitigation: identifying and handling issues early on.

📈 Efficiency in Development: smooth development with a clear roadmap.

🔍 Quality Assurance: defining quality standards for a top-notch final product.

The secret to creating great Tech Specs is to have:

👉 A good and streamlined process
👉 Avoid wasting time in countless meetings and do a significant part of the job asynchronously
👉 Involve only key people to avoid noise
👉 Have a good template and system to manage your Tech Specs

If you want to learn more about this topic and also gain access to my Notion template for creating great Tech Specs, it's your lucky day! 🙂

Edward Chiu,"The Chiu brothers founded Catalyst in 2016.

8 years later they merged with a competitor.

They got the idea while working at DigitalOcean:
- Edward was Head of Customer Success
- Kevin was Head of Sales

While there they faced all normal CS challenges and evaluated existing Customer Success Platforms (CSPs). They didn't find anything they loved.

*an idea is born*

What if they could make a CSP that...
1/ Was simple to implement
2/ Pleasant to use

The first was the most critical.

The challenge with implementations is that you need product data to calculate useful customer health scores, churn risk, etc. CS teams are dependent on engineering and data teams to help them get that data, which often never happens. And even when it does during an initial implementation, it needs to be maintained as new features are released and it's tough to get ongoing resourcing.

One way they tried to simplify implementation was by integrating into the new systems of record that were already capturing a lot of data:
- CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot)
- Data Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery)
- Product Analytics (Amplitude/Mixpanel)

This seemingly worked quite well.

Their complete timeline:
2016 - Founded
2016 - $2.4 Seed Round 
2018 - $3M Seed+ Round
2019 - $15M Series A
2020 - $25M Series B
2022 - Series B1 (undisclosed amount)
2023 - Series C (undisclosed amount)


And finally in 2024 they merged with a competitor Totango.


-- Notes --

1/ The CS market was highly competitive before they got started. Gainsight seems to have been the clear thought leadership and had a 7 year headstart. This didn't deter them and they were able to make a major mark and win thought leadership mind-share. There were at least 5 strong players in the market before them:

- Gainsight (2009)
- Totango (2010)
- Planhat (2015)
- Vitally (2015)
- ChurnZero (2015)
→ Catalyst (2016)
- Custify (2016)
- HubSpot Customer Success (2024)


2/ I love that they were early pioneers in founder-led marketing on LinkedIn. Nick Mehta probably deserves a lot of credit for the inspiration here, but they milked LinkedIn very well. Between the Edward and Kevin they had 70k on LinkedIn.

Elias Kokaly,"DataGrail's customer data was scattered across 6 fragmented sources... 

...until they used Account Intelligence.

When the customer success team evolved from managing renewals to driving product adoption, they needed complete visibility into account health. 

But customer information was scattered across Slack, Salesforce, Google Drive, and other tools with no single source of truth.

Their support team was already using Pylon, so DataGrail implemented Account Intelligence to unify customer context across post-sales.

Here's what changed:

→ 6 data sources consolidated into one customer view
→ Significant hours saved per CSM on manual research
→ At-risk accounts proactively identified through automated health scoring
→ Contraction risks spotted (customers paying for undeployed products)
→ Expansion opportunities surfaced (customers using unpurchased products)

AI Web Research fields even monitor external risks like champion departures or major business changes that could impact renewals.

Ethan Evans,"I know an engineer who has been stuck in a mid-level role for 30+ years because he doesn’t care what his managers think. He cares about technical excellence. That is great, but it won’t get you promoted. 

Technical excellence alone does not get engineers promoted because technical excellence alone does not create business value.  To get promoted, especially at higher levels, an engineer needs to make it clear that they have an impact in at least one of these three things: 

1) Revenue Generation

This could mean they launch new features/products, facilitate payments, build systems to handle more customers, or a number of other things. However, the connection between the engineer’s work and the revenue or opportunity for revenue should be clear. 

2) Cost Reduction

On the other side of revenue is cost reduction. A business’s profits increase when its costs decrease, so doing any work that improves the efficiency of the business will be seen as valuable. 

3) Moat Construction

If an engineer’s work doesn’t have direct impact on profit but does help create a competitive advantage for the company, this will also be seen as incredibly valuable. 

The ways in which an engineer can influence each of these three things is practically unlimited, but the important thing for engineers to understand is that doing value-adding work will lead to promotion. Doing maintenance work (exclusively) leads to a maintenance position. 

This may be a very stable job, which is great if that is what you want. But it won’t be a fast-growing or far-reaching career. If you want one of those, you have to create growth for the company. 

I wrote an article for Jordan Cutler’s “High Growth Engineer” newsletter that goes through how you can become an engineer that drives impact and gets promoted to higher and higher roles. 

The insights come from my 25+ years as an engineering leader throughout my career, based directly on what has led me to promote scores of engineers. 

It includes the list of the 5 top traits in engineers that I promoted, as well as stories and examples of engineers creating outsized value.

Finn Thormeier,"I grew from 1K to 43K LinkedIn followers in 8 months. But I didn’t start with a system or a content calendar. On the Founder-led Marketing podcast, I explained what I did instead.

When I first started posting, everyone around me was talking about frameworks and content calendars.
For someone just starting, those playbooks felt overwhelming.

The hardest part isn’t the system.
It’s just getting started.

That’s why I didn’t worry about whether my posts were “good.”
If they flopped, nobody would see them anyway.
What mattered was building the muscle of putting words out consistently.

If you’re thinking about starting, here’s how:
1/ Start by building the muscle. Don’t overthink. Just post what you would read.
2/ Notice patterns. Look back after a few weeks. Themes always emerge.
3/ Experiment. Share the same idea in different ways.
4/ Commit. Give yourself 6-12 months before judging.

Focus less on the “how.”
Focus more on starting.

Fivos Aresti,"A modern outbound playbook for 2025:

Many predicted the demise of outbound. Well, it's alive & kicking. GTM leaders told me that intent-based outbound is the no. 2 channel where they plan to invest more in 2026, just behind AI discovery.

Here's an extremely tactical guide to what's working (and AI workflows you can steal) via Fivos Aresti, co-founder of AI-first growth studio Workflows.io.

👉 Manual cold outreach for ICP target accounts

Signals are great, but most target accounts aren't in market (yet). Start by mapping out the TAM & then filter down to a list of target accounts.

Fivos found 66,000+ companies, then narrowed it to 5,700 ICP targets. These were split into four tiers:

 - Dream 150 accounts (highly manual)
 - Tier 1 (cold calling & more personalization)
 - Tier 2 (automation via email & LinkedIn)
 - Tier 3 (automation via email only)

🛠️ Key tools: BuiltWith (identify HubSpot users), GetLatka (identify SaaS companies), Exa (crawl websites w/ AI), Crunchbase (identify funding), Apollo (identify firmographic info), Clay (research & qualification).

👉 Automated, signal-based plays for other ICP accounts

These perform 2x-10x better than cold outreach plays. The five signal-based plays they prioritized:

 - Customer alumni play
 - Website visitor de-anonymization play
 - LinkedIn connections of founders play
 - LinkedIn engagement play
 - Social listening play

LinkedIn connections of founders is performing best. Fivos sees a 25.4% (!) reply rate, although much of this is harvesting demand from 1.5+ years of posting content.

Giulio Michelon,"When Giulio first reached out a couple of months ago and proposed me to chat on his podcast I declined, because I was super swamped with work.

So he said something unexpected: “what if I come to your place?!”

And that sold it to me. There is a magic in having in-person conversations that remote can’t replicate (trust me, I run a remote podcast!).

Now the interview is out and I am so grateful for it. It is probably the best one I ever had, also thanks to Giulio’s thorough prep 🙏

Gourav Khanijoe,"""Consistency is hard. Still do it."" -- this lesson helped Gourav reach Staff Engineer in just 8 years.

He realized that as he grew, projects started to take longer, and it wasn't always a straight path upward.

Projects would always start to feel like a drain at some point. You start to lose confidence, priorities shift, requirements change, all while it's already been going on for 3+ months. 

It's not easy to stay consistent and keep pushing forward in these conditions.

But at the end of the day, if you want to show up like a leader, you need to keep pushing forward and make it easier.

So he:
1. Always broke down into milestones, then broke those down even further
2. Documented decisions to avoid backtracking
3. Reminded himself to reward progress

Doing these allowed him to show up and be seen like a leader. He went on to get more project opportunities, ultimately leading to his Staff promotion in just 8 years.

""With unlimited time and perfect information, what would you send to your prospects that would be independently valuable to them"" --> this is PVP

Not only did we land with with JUST ChatGPT, but we actually found real leads for them on stage.

Hamish Grant,"How a top 1% GTM org uses AI agents ⤵️

There’s a lot of talk about AI for GTM. But very few have real AI agents in production with real life customers. 

Enter Hamish Grant and the GTM engineering team at SafetyCulture, a global platform that helps frontline teams find a better way to work. They have 2 million users & 500k free team signups per year. 

The impact of their AI agents so far:
 - Near-100% lead enrichment coverage
 - 2x increase in opportunities created (!)
 - 3x increase in meeting booking rates from AI-powered outbound (!!)
 - 10% lift in feature adoption

How they did it in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/eDW6marH

The top four AI agent use cases at SafetyCulture ⤵️

1. AI-powered lead enrichment

Built an AI-powered lead enrichment that’s platform-agnostic, calling five providers in parallel. This eliminated hundreds of hours of manual research & increased enrichment to near-100% coverage.

2. The AI Auto BDR

Trained an AI inbound BDR to handle (1) personalized outreach sequences, (2) knowledge base powered responses, and (3) meeting booking, synced with AE calendars. Saw a 3x increase in meeting booking rate & a 2x increase in opportunities created.

Tools: Retool (AI agent platform), ZoomInfo, HubSpot, Gong, Salesforce and Redshift.

3. AI lifecycle personalization

The AI Auto BDR already personalizes outreach sequences. SafetyCulture wanted to take this a step further with a feature recommender that suggests adjacent use cases based on peer behavior. This led to +10% adoption of new features, improved retention via deeper usage.

4. AI custom app layer for marketing and sales

Replaced necessary (but clunky) GTM systems with an AI-first interface that’s one pane of glass for all customer information and the next-best-action to be taken. Over 80% of the marketing and sales team are active users of the custom app layer. BDRs save 30 minutes per opportunity with automated hand-offs.

AI adoption is more than just rolling out ChatGPT across the team. And we’re still in the early stages of finding out what’s possible. I’m excited to keep following along.

Hugo Bowne-Anderson,"🚫 Stop building agents. Here's what you should build instead.

Using agents in production code relinquishes all control to the LLM. While LLMs are smart, they're not THAT smart and will get many things wrong, like...
• What tools should be used
• When work should get handed off to the next agent
• What the output should look like

Agents are also highly non-deterministic. So the results of a documentation generation agent can make all your docs look inconsistent.

✅ Here are the five AI patterns you should know that aren't agents.
1. Prompt chaining: Call an LLM with a function. Get structured data. Feed that into the next LLM
2. Parallelization: Break up LLM calls across multiple, parallelizable functions. It speeds up the final result and results in higher quality since the LLM can just focus on one thing for each prompt
3. Routing: LLM classifies the input to a predefined set of values, then you call regular code based on what it returned
4. Orchestrator & worker: LLM takes input and generates a dynamic set of substeps from the options available. Those substeps are passed off to workers for processing
5. Evaluation & optimization: LLM takes a result and acts as an evaluator. If it doesn't meet the criteria provided, it loops back and iterates on it, like a newspaper editor.

These patterns and code snippets are all documented in the latest High Growth Engineer article if you'd like to learn more: https://lnkd.in/eRXw6dar. Shout-out to Hugo Bowne-Anderson , the guest author for this article.

And credit to Anthropic and their original article that came up with these patterns 🙏

Hywel Carver,"Why does developer training feel like a waste of time?

One of the paradoxes in tech is that engineers are among the professionals who care *the most* about personal growth, and yet traditional training most often spectacularly fails.

To dive into this I spoke with Hywel Carver, co-founder of Skiller Whale, who has spent years researching what makes tech learning stick.

Since I work on Refactoring, good learning is super close to my heart, and I learned so much from this chat. Here are some takeaways: 

↳ 🎯 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 ≠ 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 ≠ 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 — information can be Googled, skills need practice with feedback, and wisdom comes from understanding context across multiple experiences.

↳ 🔄 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗱𝗱𝘀 *𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻*, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 — hiring for skills gives you speed today, but investing in learning compounds over time and always wins eventually.

↳ 📊 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 — attendance rates and completion metrics are meaningless. Tie learning to business outcomes like performance improvements or reduced cycle time.

↳ 🤖 𝗔𝗜 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 — as AI handles more code generation, developers need deeper fundamental understanding, like pilots who rely on autopilot but must understand their systems inside out.

↳ 🎯 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 — make granular assessments to ensure developers only learn what they don't already know, avoiding the frustration of rehashing familiar concepts.

Irina Stanescu,"Yesterday, something totally unexpected happened to my LinkedIn profile, and I still can't believe it!


🚀 I received the Linkedin Top Voice badge.

Not the community top voice (which I lost a few days ago and, to be honest, I don't find very valuable).

📝 According to LinkedIn: ""Top Voices is an invitation-only program featuring a global group of experts on LinkedIn, covering a range of topics across the professional world, helping members uncover valuable knowledge relevant to them.""

It's not about the number of followers, impressions, or anything else. It's about how Linkedin and readers perceive the value of your content, which, for me, means a lot.

👨‍🏫 Over the last 6-7 months, I have written 180+ posts here on LinkedIn where I attempted to condense my knowledge, share my experiences, and highlight many errors I made during my career. I also invested a lot of effort in making them visually appealing, easily digestible for everyone, and sometimes even funny.

Now, I might have been lucky, but being recognized with the LinkedIn Top Voice, imho is a nice reward for all the effort I've put into delivering valuable content.

I am also thrilled to have received this recognition alongside some great writers here on LinkedIn whom you absolutely must follow if you haven't already:

- Irina Stanescu
- Omar Halabieh
- Roberto Ferraro
- Anemari Fiser

JA Westenberg,"For the new year, I wish you more *thick* desires.

This time of the year always sparks some reflection, and I find myself drawn to philosophical articles more than technical ones. This is the best piece I have read last week, by JA Westenberg: https://lnkd.in/dsYzUH8Q

Quoting part of it:

A thick desire is one that changes you in the process of pursuing it.
A thin desire is one that doesn't.

The thin desire keeps reproducing itself.
The thick desire transforms its host.

Thick desires are inconvenient.

They take years to cultivate and can't be satisfied on demand. The desire to master a craft, to read slowly, to be embedded in a genuine community: these desires are effortful to acquire and impossible to fully gratify.

So, for 2026 I wish us all more inconvenient, effortful, and unscalable desires to fulfill. Things that we don't need to monetize, for which there are no users to attract, but that ultimately change us in the process.

Jacob Bank,"Inside a marketing team with 0 marketers. It's just the founder and ~40 AI agents collectively doing the work of a 5 person team 👀

This is from Jacob Bank, founder & CEO at Relay.app, who finally got around to putting his AI agents into an ""org chart"" and it's super cool to see.

I sat down with Jacob to unpack exactly how he did it – and how you can do it, too. The TL;DR:

👉 AI agents have spiky intelligence and can be surprisingly powerful for marketing tasks.

👉 Modern teams will have hundreds of AI agents in the org chart for every one person.

👉 While that sounds complex, each individual agent is much easier to build than you think.

👉 There’s power in building your own personal AI agent stack that’s specific to your goals and style of working. (This stack is also something you can bring to future roles.)

You can get the full version and templates/screenshots in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

Check it out, then chime in: how are you using AI agents in your GTM?

Jacob Bank,"The ability to build & manage AI agents is quickly becoming a core skill for everyone. Here are 5 of my favorite marketing use cases for AI agents -- with templates ⤵️ 

1️⃣ Lead scoring & qualification

Lead scoring is part art, part science. You want to enrich fields via 3rd party data, but also bring in form data & some human(like) judgement. 

Turns out AI agents are great at this -- and you can add a human-in-the-loop escalation via Slack when the classification isn't clear.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

2️⃣ Lifecycle emails

Traditional lifecycle emails are pretty mid (did I say that right?!). But AI agents can track new customers, analyze interesting ones & then automatically draft personalized emails suggesting next steps.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

3️⃣ Competitor tracking 

Everyone is racing to write comparative content for AI search. This content needs accurate, real-time info on competitors including features, pricing info, reviews & more (otherwise you'll get penalized).

Turns out that AI is pretty great at scraping text and sending alerts when there are significant updates.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

4️⃣ Content research

You need to stay on track with what's trending with your audience & key influencers in your space. But nobody has time to monitor dozens of LinkedIn profiles & Substacks. You can get an AI agent to do the research for you & write a report on the top-performing themes.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

5️⃣ LinkedIn coaching

AI models have spiky intelligence. While they struggle with things that seem easy, they're surprisingly brilliant at things like analysis & coaching. You can create your own PhD-level coach to improve your LinkedIn game with tips on what's going well & what to change.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

Jamin Ball,"This data should be such a wakeup call for GTM teams. 

Public SaaS companies ended Q1 with an estimated average gross margin-adjusted CAC payback period of 57 months based on data from Jamin Ball / Clouded Judgement (link in comments). Said differently, it takes the BEST companies nearly five years to recover their sales & marketing spending. Five years!

Zero public companies ended Q1 with a CAC payback period of less than 12 months. Only five were under 24 months (Digital Ocean, AppFolio, Atlassian, Olo and Q2). Meanwhile, 24 reported either a CAC payback period above 100 months or negative net-new ARR added.

Perhaps more troubling, this isn’t some extreme outlier quarter. It’s not something we can continue to blame on ‘the macro’ or external events. 

The average CAC payback period over the past twelve quarters is now 41 months. CAC payback periods haven’t been healthy since Britney Spears’s conservatorship ended in 2021!

Public companies can usually afford for their GTM to be inefficient in the short-term. They have plenty of profitable legacy customers who can subsidize sales and marketing. And they can sneak in a price increase or two (or three) to squeeze even more from these folks. 

But the subsidies can’t go on forever. And a reckoning could be on the horizon.

AI isn’t what’s coming for software GTM jobs, at least not yet. The real villain is GTM inefficiency. But AI might just be what saves them.

Janis Ozolins,"There's one thing that literally changed my approach to sharing content during the last 6 months.


Learn to create visuals.

I can't count how many people reach out to me every day to ask how I create these visuals.

They are always surprised when I tell them that I can barely hold a pencil in my hand, that I had no previous design experience, and that it takes me from 10-20 minutes to create one of these.

𝗦𝗼 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗜 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁?

🧠 I took a course from Janis Ozolinis that opened my mind (link in the comments).

✍️ I began practicing and publishing visuals from day one (even if they weren't great).

👀 I started following great visual designers and interacted with them.

🔁 I experimented a lot, changed things  (I created 15 versions of my own font).

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸?

📝 I use Figma and I collect all my ideas there.

🗂️ I have one page on Figma with all my visuals divided into 3 sections: Ideas, Drafts, Published.

💡 Every time I have an inspiration or I see something that could be transformed into a visual, I draw a sketch in the ""Ideas"" section.

🚸 Every morning, while walking back from taking my daughter to kindergarten, I start thinking about a visual and a post I want to publish.

🏠 Once at home, I create the visual; a simple visual usually takes between 10-20 minutes, while I create more complex visuals during the weekends.

🤖 Once it's done, I ask ChatGPT if the visual makes sense and the wording is correct (this to me is very helpful).

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼 𝗜 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲?

🎨 Visualizing your ideas helps make them easily understandable to everyone.

👁️‍🗨️ Visuals capture attention and so they are great for delivering quick ideas on social networks.

🌐 You can use visuals everywhere: in your documents, presentations, with your kids, etc.

📊 Visuals make complex content lighter and smoother to read (for me, it was very useful in my newsletter).

If you want to start creating visuals, these are some people I'd suggest you follow:

Janis Ozolins
Roberto Ferraro
Pejman Milani
Hannah Wilson
Ash Lamb
Michael J Boorman
Lee Sampson
Liz Fosslien

Jason Levin ✏️,"I have a confession. 

18 months ago I bought $3.6M worth of Palantir stock, but…

I have literally no idea what the company does. 

At first I was terrified to go out to dinner with friends because people would keep talking about Palantir. 

I didn’t want to be caught looking like an idiot. 

So I called my friend Jason Levin ✏️ and told him the truth.

That’s when we realized something: no one has any f*cking idea what Palantir does. 

If Palantir can be worth $225B without a single person understanding their business, imagine how much it could be worth if people actually understood wtf it did. 

So we rebuilt Palantir using no code tools and pitched it to investors. 

Turns out VCs had no idea what it did either, because we raised $32M for it. 

P.S. Jason & I actually filmed ourselves building & pitching our new company. Watch that here: https://lnkd.in/e9-ktn3j

Jason Levin ✏️,"In 2024 I invested in 147 startups. 

90% turned out to be frauds. 

At first their CEOs would seem great. They had all the qualities I looked for in founders. 

Stanford dropouts, Forbes 30 under 30, rich parents, etc. 

But within a couple months it turned out they lied about their users and growth. 

My investors kept telling me to “do better due diligence”, but this was highly unrealistic. VCs don’t have time for that. 

So I teamed up with Jason Levin ✏️  to build an app called Is My CEO a Fraud, that would tell me how likely someone is to be a scammer. 

Within a couple days we analyzed over 15,000 tech CEOs & found thousands of frauds. 

So did we report these scammers to the police? No. 

We launched the first BaaS. Blackmail as a service. 

4,600 founders signed up to avoid having their fraud scores leaked & I’m finally making back all the money I lost investing in their shitty companies.

Apparently watching 4 hours of Love on the Spectrum at the office is “concerning”. 

At first he tried to get me to download some dating apps. 

The only problem is I’ve been banned from every app in America. 

So what did we do? 

We built a dating app where I was the only guy allowed on it. 

For years I’ve had to compete with guys who “know how to talk to women” and “don’t look like they have crippling daddy issues”. 

But not anymore. Now I only have to compete against myself. 

That got me thinking. There are billions of men that need this. 

Now dudes can bid to be the only male on the platform for 24 hours. Yesterday a software engineer paid $540,000.

I thought it was genius because 90% of dog owners I know have a disturbing attraction to their pet. 

But then the app broke, and I got pissed off. 

Right before I completely flipped out I asked myself, “how do failing tech companies turn their business around?”. 

They sell their data to the Chinese government.

Jason Levin ✏️,"My friend asked me for social media advice. They were spending 10+ hours a week on content & barely getting views. 

The problem was that their posts made people want to walk into a lake wearing lead shoes. 

Everyone knows that building a social media brand is insanely valuable, but the hard part is writing content that stands out. 

Most of the time people start posting: 

- Thought leadership that makes you throw up in your mouth
- Brain dead advice like, “wake up early” or “be on time”
- Cringe stories about their daughter’s ballet recital 

Not only does this content suck, but it just doesn’t work. So what should you do instead?

Make memes. Memes are one of the easiest ways to build an organic following and get millions of views. 

That’s why I’m hosting a webinar on how to make viral memes with my buddy Jason Levin. 

In the past year Jason and I have generated 100M+ views & made hundreds of thousands of dollars for our businesses using memes.

After going completely off-grid in Northern Michigan (where the WiFi fears to tread) and decompressing in the Ozarks (yes, I DO unplug from LinkedIn occasionally), I emerged to discover Jeff Taylor and the Boomband team had me on their radar.

Here's what happens when you stop doom-scrolling job boards and start telling your ACTUAL story: 

Spoiler: No AI wrote my responses...Bigger spoiler: The mystery guest feedback was 🔥 ...Biggest spoiler: I'm ready to bring this energy to YOUR team  🥇 Flat out truth: Donna Star is the Yoda of Executive Coaches. I see you 😁 !

To my fellow job seekers: If I can survive explaining my career pivot while secretly hoping my hair looked decent on camera, YOU can put yourself out there too.

Hiring managers: Want someone who takes calculated risks (like appearing on podcasts) but also knows when to disconnect and recharge? Let's talk. I promise my interview skills are even better when I'm not worried about my WiFi cutting out from a cabin in the woods.

Thank you Jeff Taylor Madison Rose Keefer and the 'at one time' mystery guest Donna Star for creating a space where we can be gloriously, messily HUMAN in our job search!

Jennifer Delevante-Moulen,"B2B Marketing and AI - What do CMOs care about right now?

I recently sat down with Jennifer Delevante-Moulen (CMO at Knak) and Tara Robertson (CMO at Bitly) to talk about how each of their marketing orgs are using AI and we covered:

• LinkedIn AI vs. Reality AI - what people are actually doing vs. what they say
• Why the board and CEO are asking them to explore AI strategically
• The most overhyped AI use cases in B2B marketing (and where human nuance still wins)
• Real success stories, including building an AI-powered content research engine, scaling global localization, and using AI to make creative teams more data-driven
• How they each personally use AI as a strategic thought partner as CMO

The ones we're seeing from real marketers - not the guys that get paid to write about AI use cases as a job - but the actual in-house marketers finding ways to use AI to do better marketing.

Things like style guides, custom GPTs built around your ICP, product marketing resources where you can actually put the voice of the customer into everything you do, deep customer research as the starting point for all of your writing, sales enablement etc.

This example from Jennifer Delevante-Moulen (CMO at Knak) is a good one that fits in the ""not super sexy"" but ""super useful"" category -- using AI to find content gaps and then figuring out what content to create.

Jess Cook,"Content marketers run modern marketing.

Because almost all marketing today is shaped online.

And online marketing shows up as:

- Ads
- Videos
- Articles
- Podcasts and clips like this with Jess Cook
- Social posts
- Newsletters
- Communities
- Influencers

Different formats. But none of it works without a clear content strategy and strong content marketing.

Jess is a great example of this: she started her career as a copywriter for big CPG brands. She cut her teeth writing 200+ variations of a recipe for Rice Krispie Treats.

Then built a career in content marketing: content market manager, director, VP brand and content.

Then turned that into a Head of Marketing role at a startup and was recently promoted to VP on the heels of her success using - wait for it - content to drive revenue.

Not because Vector's content gets a lot of impressions and their podcast is unique or because their little mascot is cute.

But because it's working! Those things are driving revenue. 

I had a conversation with Jess last week (now out on my podcast) and she shared three key marketing plays that she's run over the past year:

1. Influencer Marketing - how does it work in B2B, how did she find influencers, what did it cost, how much pipeline was generated, how did they measure it

2. Podcasting - why they started a podcast, how their podcast stands out, how they record, when/where, how they prep, how they know it's working

3. LinkedIn - we talk a bit about what content types (and strategy) is working well here today

4. Career Path - her path from content to VP Marketing

I was having a long conversation with our Head of Marketing Jess Lytle about this last week.

And she crushed me.

She said: it's the same thing as you telling us to write more on LinkedIn; behavior change is hard. You just have to make it a priority.

She was showing me some amazing stuff she does with NotebookLM and how we can be using this to build a brain for our content flywheel and I was blown away but also frustrated - why aren't we doing this? More? Faster? Better?

Jess said: people are still adverse to change, like ""is this really better than ChatGPT?"" New tools just feel like another thing to learn on top of everything else -- but once you see how much time it saves you, you will wish you started sooner.

An interesting thought from the episode: how quality and security are connected. From Johannes:

""[Security vs code quality] is an underrated topic in the industry today. We talked about the null pointer exceptions or these slow regular expressions, right? That can lead to security issues. That’s more of the obvious examples of bugs.

Think about unreadable code, not well-maintained code: that’s often like spaghetti code. At first, it’s not so obvious how this is connected to security.
If you think about how code is not easy to comprehend, not easy to review. Then you do pair programming or code reviews in your development team — then in that spaghetti code, you will more likely overlook security problems of your colleague.

Now, maybe someone found an issue or and issue and reports it back to you. As a developer, you have to fix it. But if it’s not maintainable code, you cannot fix the security problem easily. So quality suddenly becomes a security issue in how the attacker window stays open longer!

Your code quality is super related to code security, especially now with AI-generated code. We typically see poor quality of code here. And that becomes a problem for security.”",65.0,7.0,6.0,,,Teacher,Engineering/Technical,Insight/Observation,Listicle/Breakdown,Text-only,"What are code security basics us devs should know about?

Josh Blyskal,"Yesterday, ChatGPT hit 2.5 BILLION (🤯) prompts per day, up from 1 billion in December. It's quickly approaching Google's 14 billion daily searches. Getting recommended by AI engines is no longer just a weekend side project (*guilty*).

Josh Blyskal from Profound analyzed data from 100,000 prompts to figure out how these AI engines actually work. Here are nine practical takeaways that you could start applying now to improve your AI search visibility:

(Don't miss the full deep dive in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/e2GdwgNN)

1. Decide which prompts you want to own.

2. Be aware that answer engines behave differently. ChatGPT & Perplexity share only 11% of domain citations. 

3. Write specialized, specific content. 

4. Create surround sound around your product. The best starting points are UGC & social media sites like Reddit, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Quora.

5. Get mentioned on Reddit. It's the single most-cited domain in ChatGPT & Perplexity. 

6. Use structured comparisons and lists. Remember that ChatGPT loves to ""borrow"" entire answers in chunks rather than do the thinking itself.

7. Make fewer images and more tables. AI engines can't see images well.

8. Measure your influence, not just clicks. The vast majority of AI search is zero-click (but it can still be highly influential.)

9. Stay on top of citation drift. Half of domains cited change in a given month.

Hope you find this useful! If you have other learnings, drop 'em in the comments 🙏

3) If it has traction, learn why and get feedback; if it doesn’t have traction, try something else
4) Once something sticks, improve it and make it better

Josh Braun,"I just spent four days with 300 millionaires—not just wealthy individuals, but men deeply committed to becoming the best versions of themselves. These are fathers, husbands, mentors, and leaders who strive to make a lasting impact on their families, communities, and the world around them.

It took me 20 years to realize that who you surround yourself with changes everything.

In GoBundance, we don’t just talk about wealth—we live by six core pillars:
✅ Age-Defying Health – Peak performance in body and mind.
✅ Genuine Relationships – Deep, meaningful connections.
✅ Horizontal Income – Freedom through passive income.
✅ Authentic Contribution – Giving back and creating impact.
✅ Extreme Accountability – Pushing each other to higher levels.
✅ Bucket List Adventures – Living life to the fullest.

After four years in this tribe, my habits, potential, and trajectory have completely transformed. Bonus, I have a freaking amazing marriage of 14 years and proud to be a dad who spends quality time with his wife and daughter, while juggling all the business priorities.

If you’re ready to level up your circle and surround yourself with people who are playing at the highest level, let’s talk.

Joyce Chen,"💥 INTRODUCING PRODUCT INTELLIGENCE 💥

Turn your customer feedback into a product strategy. 

Support teams hear the same feature requests over and over.

But collaborating with the product team to build them is a lot of work.

You have to...

→ Gather mentions of the request
→ Quantify impact
→ Link evidence to Linear or Jira tickets
→ Notify customers upon release

Most teams don't have the time to do all this.

But with Product Intelligence, every step is automated for you.

Here's how it works...

𝟭 𝗔𝗜 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 
Automatically cluster similar customer feedback into a feature request. Filter requests by any custom field to understand which accounts they affect.

𝟮 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗧𝗼𝗽 𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀
See AI summaries, conversation snippets, and lists of everyone who asked for the feature, what they want, and when they mentioned it. Click into individual customer interactions to see the details. 

𝟯 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁
Sort feature requests by ARR or number of mentions to instantly quantify business impact.  

𝟰 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗧𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁𝘀
Directly create a ticket in Linear or Jira with all the evidence already attached. Next time a customer mentions the feature, it automatically gets clustered and added into the existing ticket. 

𝟱 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗨𝗽𝗼𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲
Once the feature ships, automatically draft a broadcast to notify every customer who asked for it at scale.

Instead of manually collecting feedback from tickets and conversations, you can help product build what customers actually want.

This is our next step in building the unified platform for your post-sales team.

Pylon is already where customer interactions become actionable account insights. Now, it's also where you turn feature requests into business insights that drive the product roadmap.

Julian Park 🔜 DICE 🔜 GDC,"A lot of founders ask me how to grow on LinkedIn. 

So I started a workshop series to share our strategy.  

Here's what we covered last week:

1/ Seed your followers by sending 25-40 connection requests a day.

2/ Prepare your profile by changing the default button from ""Connect"" to ""Follow"" and writing a good headline.

3/ Post interesting content like actual stories from your company or controversial takes. People hate ads. 

4/ Keep building your audience by sending targeted connection requests. For example, connect with any prospect who books a demo. 

5/ Ask your team to like and comment on posts for engagement. Have the company page post snarky comments to make it fun. 


Along with posting consistently for multiple years, this has made LinkedIn our biggest source of inbound leads to this day.

Justin Bullock,"I made one mistake that slowed down our first 100 deals. Here’s how to avoid it.

Early on, I thought being easy to buy from meant saying yes to everything.
- “Can you extend the trial?” Of course.
- “Can you do net-60 terms?” Sure.
- “Can you lower the price?” No problem.

I thought this would speed up deals. It actually stalled them.

That’s when Justin Bullock, our VP of Sales, introduced me to the Give-Get framework. When a prospect asks for something, you ask for something in return.

- If they ask for a trial extension, ask for a commitment to a decision date.
- If they ask for a discount, ask them to sign by the end of the month.
- If they want flexible payment terms, ask for an introduction to the economic buyer.

This does three things. It shortens the sales cycle. It strengthens the relationship. It prevents discounting away deals that would have closed anyway.

Once we implemented this, deals started moving faster. We built a list of what we were willing to give and what we needed to get in return.

If your sales team isn’t trained on this, they’re giving away leverage in every deal.

What’s the worst give you’ve seen in a sales deal?",510.0,60.0,11.0,,,Teacher,GTM/Sales,Tactical/Framework,Listicle/Breakdown,Text-only,I made one mistake that slowed down our first 100 deals. Here’s how to avoid it.,"I made one mistake that slowed down our first 100 deals. Here’s how to avoid it.

Justin Bullock,"Here’s how we evaluated our VP of Sales as a Series B company:


At the exec level, resumes are polished and interviews are clean. Everyone can talk about leadership.
So instead of abstract questions like “what’s your leadership style,” I focused on exposure.

1/ Backchannel references (specifically direct reports)

I asked them:
- “What’s one thing he needs to improve on?”
- “Tell me about a time you disagreed with him.”
- “Tell me about a time when things didn’t go to plan? What did he do?”

You learn very quickly whether someone takes responsibility or deflects.

2/ How they explain misses
I cared less about whether targets were hit and more about why he thought they missed.

Was it always the product? The market? Other people?
Or did they understand what broke and their role in it?

3/ Whether they can still sell
At this stage, I still want a VP of Sales who can sell (not just talk about selling).

There was always a take-home.
I had candidates sell to us and put together a sales plan.

4/ Personality and trust
This is someone I need to trust to act in the company’s best interest.

A lot of candidates didn’t make it through this process.
But the right one did.

Karri Saarinen,"The best article I have read this week is ""The Profitable Startup"" by Karri Saarinen at Linear.

You can easily measure the quality of a piece by the density of highlights you take. So here are a few of my own:

↳ ""I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster.""

↳ ""What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute.""

↳ ""For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target.""

↳ ""After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart.""

—

The main thesis here is that today profitability has become easier to reach, especially if you work in a space where there is already a market (you have competition), and no big investments are needed upfront.

Profitability is also a good north star that drives good behavior: focus on business value, don’t over hire, keep talking with customers, and so on.

I like how it feels like the tide is shifting a bit on this. With the (glaring) exception of glorious AI slop startups, it feels like there is a growing sub-culture of small to mid-size companies shipping top quality products, and creating good, sustainable culture in the process.

There is something beautiful about this “long-tail innovation”, and I hope to keep doing my small part in helping people who work on it 😊

Karthik Ramgopal,"The Evolution of LinkedIn’s Generative AI Tech Stack

Over the past two years, LinkedIn has undergone a rapid transformation in how it builds and ships AI-powered products. 

What began with a handful of GenAI features, such as collaborative articles, AI-assisted Recruiter capabilities, and AI-powered insights for members and customers, has evolved into a comprehensive platform strategy that now involves multiple products. One of the most prominent examples of this shift is Hiring Assistant, LinkedIn’s first large-scale AI agent for recruiters, designed to help streamline candidate sourcing and engagement.

Behind these product launches was a clear motivation to scale GenAI use cases efficiently and responsibly across LinkedIn’s ecosystem. 

Early GenAI experiments were valuable but siloed because each product team built its own scaffolding for prompts, model calls, and memory management. This fragmented approach made it difficult to maintain consistency, slowed iteration, and risked duplicating efforts. As adoption grew, the engineering organization recognized the need for a unified GenAI application stack that could serve as the foundation for all future AI-driven initiatives.

Note: This article is written in collaboration with the engineering team of LinkedIn. Special thanks to Karthik Ramgopal, a Distinguished Engineer from the LinkedIn engineering team, for helping us understand the GenAI architecture at LinkedIn. All credit for the technical details and diagrams shared in this article goes to the LinkedIn Engineering Team.

Kevin Smith,"How do you build a successful product in the AI era? 🤖

In our latest podcast episode I chatted with Kevin Smith, co-founder of the AI-powered podcast app Snipd. 

Kevin shared his incredible journey from quantitative finance to building and leading AI teams, offering a masterclass in creating value with new tech. Also, since he works on one of the most beloved podcast apps in the world, I asked Kevin for advice about retaining knowledge from all the stuff we consume, and, of course, what his favorite podcasts are!

Here are a few takeaways from our chat:

↳ 💡 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 — don't start by asking what you can build with AI. Instead, focus on the user's problem first and foremost. AI is just a tool in the toolbox to solve it.

↳ ⚙️ 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 — to handle the randomness of AI models, think of them as interns. Give the same task to multiple ""interns"" and have another one judge the best output.

↳ 🚀 𝗔𝗜 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗖𝗣𝗨 — AI is becoming a commodity, accessible to everyone. Your competitive moat won't come from having the best model, but from classic advantages like network effects, brand, and user experience.

↳ 📈 𝗚𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 — the biggest impact of AI in development isn't just about coding faster. It's about empowering teams to tackle things they previously couldn't, like building a video streaming infrastructure with no prior experience.

↳ 🧠 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 — to truly retain knowledge from content you consume, force yourself to identify one single key takeaway from every podcast or article. This simple habit makes a huge difference.

Kovid Batra,"As humans, there’s undoubtedly one thing we continuously do, sometimes without even realizing it. 


⚖️ Taking decisions. 

Think about it. Every action we take involves some level of decision-making, and making decisions for ourselves can sometimes be challenging.

Now, imagine the complexities of decision-making within an engineering team, where multiple individuals, possibly from diverse cultures and backgrounds, are involved.

I wish I could offer you a secret recipe for making decisions in this context, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t exist (believe me, I’ve searched for it for 10 years).

However, having robust decision-making processes within your engineering team is crucial. 

Here are the benefits:

🔥 Focuses effort
🔄 Ensures consistency
⏳ Saves time
🧭 Provides direction
🛡️ Builds resilience

So, how do you make decisions? 

There are many different approaches, including:

🪖 Autocratic
🧠 Experiential
🚀 Empowered Autonomy
📊 Data-Driven
🗳️ Majority Rule
✅ Consensus

Choosing your approach depends on various factors, such as:

- Your role and leadership style
- Your risk aversion
- Your relationship with stakeholders
- Your team's culture
- Your company's environment
- The specific nature of the decisions to be made

And particularly, the area in which you must make those decisions.

Yes, it’s a lot to digest, but you’re lucky. 

As I do every Thursday, I’ve simplified a complex topic like decision-making in Engineering Teams and shared the insights with 22.1K+ people who already subscribed to The Hybrid Hacker newsletter.

Laura Tacho,"Confirmed: Laura Tacho will deliver the keynote for The Pragmatic Summit on how AI+coding agents are changing engineering productivity. 11 Feb 2026, SF. 

Laura is one the top experts on AI + developer productivity: no fluff, just things that work, those that don't, and why.

She wrote what I consider the most practical article on this topic in The Pragmatic Engineer: How tech companies measure the impact of AI on software development, with insider details from GitHub, Google, Dropbox, Monzo, Atlassian, and 13 other tech companies: https://lnkd.in/ekuaHqaE

The most replayed The Pragmatic Engineer podcast episode also happens to be with Laura: on measuring the impact of AI on software engineering. Watch it here: https://lnkd.in/ey9DDyQT or listen on other platforms: https://lnkd.in/e6HDZBMu

And just this week, Laura told me something really interesting, backed again by data: folks working at ""traditional"" companies seem to be using AI tools even more on a daily basis than large tech companies (!!). I'm sure she'll get into details as to why this might be (hint: efficient procurement and vendor vetting is something these companies are very good at!)

“Get on the phone and we’ll show you our product.”

Today’s buyers now self-educate, run deep research with AI tools, and show up to sales calls already armed with more information than ever and ready to make a buying decision.

So what does that mean for the role of marketing? 

Should marketing own more of the funnel than ever? 

What is the playbook in marketing when buyers get all of their information from AI before talking to your company??

Luca Sartoni,"If you asked me what my number one skill was as a kid, I would tell you it was emulation. I was always exceptionally good at observing and emulating others.

However, as I grew up, I came to understand that merely copying others doesn't add any value and won't lead to success.

I'm also not a genius. I rarely invented something that didn't already exist.

That's why I transformed emulation into a source of inspiration. Getting inspired in the end is a skill you have to learn.

Here's how it works:

1) 👀 Observe how someone else is successfully adding value through their actions.
2) 🔄 As an exercise, try to replicate what they are doing.
3) 🧠 Once you've mastered the same actions, start thinking about how you can improve upon them.
4) 🔑 Make these actions your own.

That's essentially how inspiration works, at least for me and I use this simple framework for almost everything.

This is how I quickly learned:

✍️ Writing a newsletter:  I drew heavy inspiration from Luca Sartoni to start writing; then I began reading 🌀 Luca Rossi's newsletter, which inspired me with its format and style. I then found inspiration in other outstanding writers such as Gregor Ojstersek, John Crickett, Jordan Cutler, Irina Stanescu, Ryan Peterman, Caleb Mellas, Amy Mitchell, Neo Kim, Raviraj Achar, and so many others.
 
🎨 Creating Visuals: since I wanted to improve the visuals of my newsletter, I started searching for tutorial and courses. I found one by Janis Ozolins that quickly taught me the basics. Later, I had the opportunity to meet Roberto Ferraro, who inspired me a lot about how to improve my visuals. Lately I've been gaining inspiration from Pejman Milani, Hannah Wilson and others.

👥 Linkedin: It would be challenging to mention all the people from whom I have drawn inspiration on LinkedIn. Every day brings new sources of inspiration. To name a few individuals who have recently inspired me: Sergio Visinoni, Julia Zinovieva, Ryan McKesson, Omar Halabieh, Alex Ewerlöf, Mauro B., Daniel Hauck, Adrian Stanek, Gábor Till, Itzy Sabo, Anco van der Wurff

And who inspires you? I'd appreciate your suggestions for inspiring people to follow in the comments.

♻️ PLEASE REPOST IF YOU FOUND IT USEFUL, IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

Maja Voje,"If you're searching for GTM tech this Black Friday, start with these:

Maja and I asked our communities about their favorite B2B GTM tools in 2025 including which were ""most impactful"" and which are ""must try"". 195 software GTM leaders weighed in. (And Gemini sorted through 1,000+ open-ended responses 🤯.)

ChatGPT topped the list of most impactful tools with 50 write-ins. They were followed by OG HubSpot (40 write-ins) and breakout unicorn Clay (30 write-ins). This list included tried-and-true tools you're probably familiar with like LinkedIn, Gong, Notion, 6sense, Canva, Figma, Apollo & ZoomInfo.

Things got more interesting on the ""must try"" list. GTM leaders are trying out vibecoding (Lovable - 2nd, Replit - 5th, Magic Patterns) and AI agents (n8n - 3rd, Relay.app, Dust). Folks are also on the lookout for more & better tooling for advanced GTM plays (see: Clay, Keyplay, Unify).

If the ""must try"" list is any indication, we're eager to graduate beyond ChatGPT to more advanced AI use cases. But 2025 is still the year of AI experimentation vs. true impact.

Maja Voje,"What's the right go-to-market (GTM) motion for your product? I finally have data to give you a leg up ⤵️

Introducing the inaugural 2025 State of B2B GTM report. Maja Voje & I teamed up to bring you objective data into what's working in GTM right now and where is AI honestly making an impact. It's based on data from 195 B2B companies, mostly SaaS and hybrids of SaaS & AI.

Get the full report in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/ea_zYUzB

The five takeaways you need to know:

1. There are six main GTM motions in B2B. Inbound is the most popular, but not by much. 

As much as people love to hate on Outbound, don't count it out. 37% of B2B companies rely on either Outbound or an Account-Based GTM.

Intent-based outbound is the 2nd most popular channel in terms of where teams plan to increase GTM budget in 2026. Outbound! (The 1st is AI discovery.)

2. 2025 was a year of (endless) exploration. The average software company says they have 5 core GTM channels and another 5.5 GTM channel experiments.

This is, frankly, too 👏 da** 👏 many 👏 channels for a $1-10M ARR business!

3. 2026 needs to be the year of ruthless scaling.

The single best channel in terms of likelihood of having an impact surprised me: intimate events.

The first-ever GTM scorecard can help prioritize where to place your bets (see the full report 👀).

4. Everyone uses AI, relatively few see real GTM impact.

Three-in-four GTM leaders said they have top-down pressure to adopt AI. But the impact of AI is a mixed bag. More than half (53%) said they see either no impact or limited impact from AI. 

The disillusionment was most acute around AI SDRs. In the words of one survey taker, “We tried an AI SDR for six months and were unable to generate a single opportunity.” Ouch.

5. The new GTM tech stack is mostly ChatGPT?

There’s been a proliferation of next-gen GTM tools. Only one, ChatGPT, is having a breakout impact.

ChatGPT was rated the #1 most impactful GTM tool with roughly 50 write-in mentions. The closest alternative was OG HubSpot, which had about 40 write-in mentions. Clay came in third with nearly 30 write-ins.

Maja Voje,"What's the right go-to-market (GTM) motion for your product? ⤵️

When you look at a table like this (from the brilliant Maja Voje), GTM looks pretty straightforward. There are 7 main types of motions. You just need to figure out what's best for your product & scale it.

The reality is that GTM in 2025 is a bit of a 🗑️🔥. The tried-and-true channels don't work like before (👋 blogs, SEO, outbound emails). New channels aren't totally proven or are hard to scale (👋 AEO). And now we're supposed to figure out how to do this & master AI at the same time (😭). 

I want to bring objective data to the conversation. Real insights from real tech companies. And real nerds crunching the numbers (that's me!).

Maja Voje,"Introducing the 2025 GTM scorecard, just in time for annual planning ⤵️ 

Maja and I surveyed 195 B2B leaders about which GTM channels are working right now. We then mapped how popular different GTM channels are (x-axis) versus how likely they are to be impactful among adopters (y-axis).

The shorthand for interpreting this two-by-two:
1. Tried-and-true (upper right)
2. Oversaturated (lower right)
3. The next big thing (upper left)
4. Figuring it out (lower left)

I then cut the data for startups (<$10M ARR) vs. scaleups (>$10M ARR) & it's fascinating to see how the channels shift.

The best channels for startups*:
 - LinkedIn (#1)
 - Founder brand (#2)
 - Warm outbound (#3)
 - Intent-based outbound (#4)
 - Intimate events (#5)

*The magic tends to happen when you can combine these channels into a cohesive strategy, i.e. founder brand + LinkedIn + warm outbound & intimate events for those who engage.

The best channels for scaleups*:
 - Large conferences (#1)
 - SEO (#2)
 - Intimate events (#3)
 - Big product launches (#4)
 - Ecosystem marketing (#5)

*Scaleups are still seeing returns from their years of SEO investments. The question is whether they can translate their SEO into AI discovery or if they'll be leap-frogged by new entrants.

The TL;DR: No matter what stage you're at, you might want to plan for more intimate events (dinners, happy hours, etc.) next year. They're not the most scalable, but they're one of the few things that seems to work.

Maja Voje,"The GTM channels that worked before don’t necessarily work today. Here's which GTM channels I'm betting on in 2026 for early-stage startups versus mature scaleups:

The data comes from the State of B2B GTM report (N=195 GTM leaders) w/ Maja Voje (read it here: https://lnkd.in/ea_zYUzB)

Early-stage B2B startups (<$10M ARR)

1. The most popular core channels for early-stage B2B startups include LinkedIn (67%), founder brand (53%), warm outbound (49%), SEO (45%), and intent-based outbound (37%).

2. But popular doesn’t mean effective. Perhaps unsurprisingly, startups are struggling with SEO & paid ads. More are disappointed in the returns than satisfied with them.

3. The channel that consistently performed best: intimate in-person events (think: regional dinners, happy hours, meetups, hackathons). Nearly everyone who invested here said they were happy with the results.

B2B scaleups (>$10M ARR)

1. The most popular core channels for B2B scaleups include large conferences and tradeshows (80%), LinkedIn (78%), SEO (74%), paid ads (66%), and intimate in-person events (59%).

2. Outbound, particularly automated outbound via email, fell in the over-saturated quadrant as scaleups expanded beyond $10 million ARR. (You might've seen that Ramp just killed their automated outbound team.)

3. LinkedIn stops becoming a growth channel, too. RIP.

4. The positive: events have bounced back in a major way. Large conferences and intimate events are two of the best-performing channels. People are craving personal connection as an antidote to AI slop.

5. Two less talked about channels broke into the top right quadrant for scaleups: big product launches and ecosystem marketing. 

---

2025 was a year of near-endless channel exploration. The average scaleup said they have 6.8 core GTM channels and another 6.3 GTM channel experiments! Let's resolve to make 2026 the year of ruthless scaling. 

A thought exercise to start the year: If you couldn’t invest in a single new channel in 2026, what would you do differently to hit your growth targets?

The entire company mobilized and the next couple of weeks were intense.

We needed everyone to help get us back on track.

→ Ops unblocked legal and compliance reviews
→ Marketing pushed more content
→ Support and solutions fixed urgent issues

Manny Medina,"Everyone seems to be talking about AI agents. The biggest problem not enough people are talking about: how to monetize & capture the value of them.

Earlier this year Manny Medina (founder of Outreach & Paid) analyzed patterns from 60+ AI agent companies to put together a new framework for AI agent pricing.

He found 4 AI agent pricing models dominating the market. Many companies are using just 1 of the 4; others take a hybrid approach.

1. Price per workflow
2. Price per agent
3. Price per agent outcome
4. Price per agent action 

CJ Gustafson and I just sat down with Christopher O'Donnell, the former chief product officer of HubSpot, on the Mostly Growth podcast. Christopher is building his own AI-native company, Day AI, to reimagine CRM for the AI age. 

Where Christopher is betting on AI pricing: price-per-AI-agent.

This opens up access for everyone to use the CRM. It unlocks unlimited usage, integrations & data. And it's predictable for customers, fitting into their mental model for how to buy a CRM.

But each core user probably needs their own dedicated AI agent with custom permissions, workflows & data access. This means pricing remains similar to per-seat pricing while being more flexible. 

Day AI can expand as customers *either* add reps (who want their own AI agent copilot) and/or embrace automation (and want more AI agents). They're covered either way.

The jury is still out on the model (IMO), but one thing is clear: it beats the proliferation of credit models coming from every direction.

As you progress in your engineering career, the strong technical skills you've demonstrated won't be enough to get you promoted to the next level. They're necessary but not sufficient.

""What got you here won't get you there.""

Storytelling skills are incredibly important everywhere, but especially in tech as you move to higher levels. The job will increasingly be about convincing others of your ideas on a larger and larger scale. Storytelling does just that.

Mark Roberge,"I'm on the edge and I just can't take it anymore...



Since 2020, I've been focused on building at the bleeding edge of AI and GTM as the OG GTM Engineer...

Most of that work has been speaking to other in-the-trenches practitioners, not worrying about leaving folks behind.

Today, I'm so happy to announce that Topline Media to the world... a chance to bring some of my ideas to GTM leaders around the world and not just to those on the bleeding edge.

Some stats from the team:
1. Today it takes 8000 attempts to get 1 real customer meeting.
2. It takes dozens of meetings to close a deal.
3. And then 40 months of revenue to break even on that deal.

We need actual practices to get out of this steep decline... a media outlet that is about documenting building, not talking heads.

I'd suggest you subscribe as my goal specifically when I contribute is to translate what is happening at the bleeding edge actually building workflows (Claude Code, APIs, data workflows, PVPs, PQS, my love of vertical SaaS and why) to folks who want to experiment there.

So you'll see me talk about topics like...
1. Why ICP and TAM scoring lead you way astray, and what to do instead
2. The horizontal SaaS company thought trap, and how to escape
3. The exact steps to build a useful GTM engine from absolute 0

Matt Webb,"I enjoyed this article by Matt Webb about how to coordinate agents that do stuff for us: https://lnkd.in/dVQdgzBz

It also made me discover Weft, which I didn’t know: https://lnkd.in/dXjUwzJp

Matt argues that the best abstraction for agents is *teammates*, and so they belong to our todo lists. E.g. Linear for work (which jumped on this and smartly released “Linear for Agents”) and… Apple Reminders for our lives.

Personally I don’t use Reminders, I use Todoist, which has an API and MCP server, so I think I will tinker with it 🤔 e.g. I may turn my own workspace in a Team, add a fake person who is an agent, and assign stuff to it.

Has anyone tried something similar?

All this stuff is duct-taped for now, but to me it makes sense. Makes me think that a lot of software may end up adding first-party support for agents as individual users, which is helpful and doesn’t break how we have been using tools so far.

Maude Lemaire,"What does it really take to refactor big, critical systems without breaking everything?! 🏗️

Today I spoke with Maude Lemaire, Principal Engineer at GitHub and author of the book ""Refactoring at Scale."" With over 8 years of experience at Slack (through its massive growth from 100 to 1200 engineers) and now tackling GitHub's massive cloud migration, Maude has seen it all when it comes to large-scale system changes.

Here are a few takeaways from our chat:

↳ 🗣️ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 — the biggest mistake in large refactoring is making changes *too* invisible. You need to make it invisible to users but loud to your engineering teams, so they can quickly debug when things inevitably break.

↳ 🎯 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗲𝘀𝘁 — successful platform migrations focus on adoption. Water flows downstream, so meet developers where they are and make the new way the path of least resistance.

↳ 🔍 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 — when onboarding to complex legacy systems, ask ""why is it this way?"" with curiosity, rather than accusation. Understanding the archaeology of decisions helps you build better solutions.

↳ 🚀 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 — forget perfect staging environments. Production has unique traffic patterns and edge cases you'll never reproduce. Use feature flags, canaries, and embrace controlled risk.

↳ 📍 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗳𝘁 𝗮𝘀 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 — meet developers in their IDE with immediate feedback. Finding out your test failed after 45 minutes of CI is a table-flipping moment that kills productivity.

↳ 🍽️ 𝗞𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 — you'll never get to 100% with big migrations. Like a lived-in kitchen, some things will always remain on the counter, and that's perfectly fine.

Maura Rivera,"My former arch rival is my guest this week. Dun dun dunnnnnnnn.

No just kidding. Trying to get a thirsty hook. That was 7-8 years ago and so much has happened since then.

One of the best parts about running Exit Five is that each week I get to chat with a top CMO in B2B, and this week my guest is Maura Rivera from Qualified.

In a world where CMOs are changing jobs every 1-2 years, Maura has been holding it down at Qualified for SIX YEARS. That deserves some type of award, and is worth unpacking (plus she told me something like half of the marketing team has been there that long too, which says a lot).

We talked about:

• Why product launches are the glue for marketing (and why you need to have this cadence of product launches and a tight relationship with the VP Product)

•  What agentic marketing really means for the future of marketing, how is it different than ""marketing"" and why outbound is actually working for them right now (I thought outbound is dead?)

• How events have become a huge part of their strategy. Plus, plenty of good banter along the way. This was a fun one. I want to go hangout with Maura now.

Meg Adams,"How do you build psychologically safe teams? 🛡️

This week on the podcast I had an eye-opening conversation with Meg Adams, Senior Director of Engineering at The New York Times, about the neuroscience of leadership and creating psychological safety in engineering teams.

The problem with these topics is that they always risk staying fluffy and high-level, but Meg instead was super practical and provided plenty of examples. 
 
Here are a few things I learned:

↳ 🧠 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗙 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 — our brains respond to social situations as if they were physical threats. The five key domains are Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. When threatened, we lose cognitive capacity for creative problem solving.

↳ 🎯 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆 — engineers are particularly sensitive to knowing where the goalpost is and having control over their time and approach. Most team practices (e.g. code reviews), when handled poorly can trigger status and autonomy threats.

↳ 🗣️ 𝗔𝗰𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 — when you can't provide certainty (like during layoff rumors), just acknowledge the uncertainty. Saying ""I don't have information to share right now"" still provides some certainty about the process.

↳ 🤝 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 — cultural change happens when leaders embody good behaviors in real situations, not through abstract processes or documents. The most powerful moments come from being part of a team and demonstrating these principles.

↳ 🚨 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝘁 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 — individual contributors have more automatic relatedness from their team. Managers have at once 1) larger surface area for triggers, and 2) rarely anyone taking care of them.

Menoua Keshishian,"I didn't believe it until I saw it: but it *really* works in open offices! And you cannot even hear devs ""whispering.""

This is ML engineer Menoua Keshishian at Wispr Flow HQ, in SF, coding... by whispering to Cursor Agent using his mic (a BOYA Gooseneck that costs ~$70).

I was standing next to him and heard nothing. Everyone in the office does the same.

I have no affiliation with Wispr Flow (this post is not paid, I have no form of financial ties or other etc) - but saw devs like Arvid Kahl use it and swear by it. So I also gave it a go, and it slowly is growing on me for agentic coding (when more context for the agent is more helpful than less). The setup is super clever: you press and hold a usually rarey used button (the fn button on the Mac) and then Wispr ""listens"" and when you stop, it insers the *meaning* of what you said (not the exact transcript!). When you ramble and self-correct, it gets it right most of the time!

So when I was in SF, I stopped at their offices to say hi to the team and learn more.

CEO and cofounder Tanay Kothari told me that based on their data of 20K users anonymously analyzed, devs who use Wispr do 18% ""whispering"" (vs 82% typing) in month 1, and 72% ""whispering"" (vs 28% typing) in month 5, and it grows almost linearly until that point.

It's an interesting new trend, and AI agents are the reason it works.

I shared more details in a summary of my trip to SF, and interesting startups I met: https://lnkd.in/eGZscGXj

Update: in the comments, see notes on how whispering strains vocal cords as much as shouting - keep that in mind! My use case is I am alone in my room and talk with normal voice to the agent, similar to how James Stanier shared below.

Meri Williams,"This week I had the pleasure of speaking with Meri Williams, CTO of Pleo and long-time host of LeadDev conferences, about one of tech's most challenging topics: 𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 🎨

With their 10+ years at LeadDev, Meri has a unique perspective on how engineering leadership has evolved — and what still needs to change.

Here is what I learned from them:

↳ 🔬 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁 — diverse teams have to rely on data more and collaborate better to reach consensus, as opposed to relying to hidden biases. This leads to stronger decisions.

↳ 🎯 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 — people who consider joining your team will ask themselves: Am I expected here? Am I respected here? Can I be myself here and be successful? Work backwards from making success possible for everyone.

↳ 🎟️ 𝗙𝗶𝘅 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 — before adding diverse talent, audit your practices. Are all social events alcohol-focused? Do meetings work for people with kids? Diversity goes beyond genders and ethnicities. Change these before expecting different people coming and fix them for you.

And of course, no chat is complete these day without talking about AI. Meri has strong opinions about how AI changes how we develop talent:

↳ 🧠 𝗝𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 — with AI, entry-level engineers are reviewing code at a much earlier point in their career. We need to teach these skills sooner.

↳ 🏗️ 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 — when you can create so fast with AI, understanding scalability, maintainability, and security becomes critical to avoid future disasters.

↳ 💬 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗹𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 — junior engineers are using ChatGPT to ask the same questions repeatedly without fear. But to get the most value, they still need to learn how to ask good questions.

Michelle Lim,"What is it like to be a founding engineer at a startup, and how do you become one? Michelle Lim joined Warp as the founding engineer, and she's now a founder at Flint AI where she is hiring founding engineers. We talk through her journey and tactics helpful for anyone wanting to make an impact at a startup.

I really liked how Michelle was realistic how, as a founding engineer, you have two jobs at once:

#1: Software engineering. Build the stuff you need to do

#2: Everything else to help the business succeed, including lots of things that are not to do with software engineering! Do all of these once you did job #1 well. In return, you get to learn a lot on how a business is built - which will help you if and when you become a founder yourself!

It helps you...

What it doesn't do... is teach you how to grow on LinkedIn.

I've been filling that gap by running a workshop series on founder-led marketing.

In our third session last week we talked about creating good LinkedIn content, scaling brand visibility in AI search, and building a Reddit presence.

Nicole Forsgren,"Finally, someone wrote it down in a book:

To understand what is going well/poorly inside your engineering org: ask the devs what this is! Talk to a bunch of them - from different teams, seniority levels etc - and understand what's really going on.

From the excellent new book by Nicole Forsgren and Abi Noda called ""Frictionless""

Arrived yesterday. So far a very timely read.

The book attempts to answer the question: ""AI can generate code in minutes - so why does shipping software still take forever?""

It's a very timely one. As with Accelerate, I think this might also become a classic

Niko Bonatsos,"Niko invested in Pylon when we were 3 months old.

Today, we're worth hundreds of millions, 74 people, and 5x'ing ARR YoY.

But back when he invested, we had close to nothing...

- 10 customers
- $60k ARR
- 0 employees
- first-time founders

...with no clear story on how we'd get to $1B ARR.

But he believed in us when no one else did.

Despite our many faults, he knew that Robert, Advith, and I would find a way to make Pylon successful.

And he was right.

Working with Niko while he was at General Catalyst was an absolute pleasure. He sat on our board, responded to messages quickly (always a text message away), pushed us to be more ambitious, questioned us in the right ways, helped us make critical hires, guided us on fundraises, got us featured in TechCrunch (twice), connected us to industry contacts, helped us find customers, and so much more.

Niko is a dream investor for any early-stage founder.

Omar Halabieh,"Retrospective Meetings are a waste of time!


This is what I frequently hear from both engineers and managers.

However, just yesterday, I asked for feedback from some experienced people in my network with diverse backgrounds, and most of them agreed on the effectiveness of these meetings.

🤔 Why are people so divided on this topic?

I believe, as with many other things, the significant issue lies in how this tool is used, with Scrum likely being the primary cause of this negativity.

We've become used to:

- Countless retrospectives (at the end of every sprint)
- Endless retrospectives (I've witnessed retrospectives lasting an entire day!)

It's understandable why there's so much negativity, but I believe retrospectives can be useful and run effectively.

How?

🏛️ Cultivating the right culture (this is a prerequisite)
📅 Knowing when to conduct retrospectives
🪖 Assigning the appropriate facilitator
👥 Identifying the right participants
🏗️ Properly preparing for the meeting
🔶 Selecting the most effective formats

Interested in learning more?

You know, it's Thursday, your lucky day, and I've just published a comprehensive guide on running effective Retrospective Meetings👇

https://lnkd.in/dW-MJhCH

A special thank you to all the people who helped by sharing their feedback about retrospectives.

Pascalle Bergmans 📣,"If you are a Software or Systems Engineer, I'm almost sure there's one aspect you are overlooking in your career growth.

📢 Public speaking.

Why is it crucial, even more than mastering ML, Rust, Kubernetes or other technologies? 

While tech skills are essential, public speaking is key for those aiming for leadership roles (Tech Leads and EMs).

How do I know this?

😥 From personal experience, neglecting public speaking has cost me a lot of opportunities.

Why is it so important? I'll give you four reasons:

🗣️ Better Communication simplifies explaining complex tech concepts.

🚀 Visibility: enhances your professional profile and opens new opportunities.

🤝 Team Collaboration: improves sharing ideas and working together.

🌱 Knowledge Reinforcement: preparing talks solidifies your understanding.

So, if you are early in your career, don't make the same mistake I did. Step out of your comfort zone and start practicing public speaking.

If you need help with that, my friend Pascalle Bergmans 🧚‍♀️ has just launched an awesome course and offered a £50 discount for my audience. 

I'm not earning a single penny from it, but I genuinely believe it's a great course – both practical and scientific. You can find the link in the first comment 👇

Peter Walker,"I'm having some major cognitive dissonance about startup M&A. Anyone else confused? 

It *seems* to be 🌶️ with a record number of acquisitions in 2025 according to Peter Walker (see the chart). Yet Jason M. Lemkin & others are pointing out that in SaaS ""the exits... are no more."" What gives?!?

CJ and I discussed this with SaaS legend Dave Kellogg on today's Mostly Growth podcast. What we're seeing:

1. M&A is hot and there are buyers at the table. 

Big Tech co's increasingly need an AI story. This could be partially due to the lenient regulatory environment as well.

2. Exit *count* is up, but it's not clear if the $$ of exits are up. 

Peter Walker shared that ~75-80% of the exits are Seed/Series A companies. Many of these look more like tuck-ins or acquihires.

3. AI companies are the hottest targets. 

Some of these are AI-native (see: SFDC buying Doti & Convergence AI, Meta buying Scale AI), as expected. Others aren't AI-native but they benefit from the AI boom by *selling* to AI companies (see: OpenAI buying Statsig).

4. There's less & less interest for ""good-not-great"" SaaS companies.

The best liquidity path is probably PE. Yet PE might be unwilling to pay anywhere near the price of the last VC round. And PE can afford to be highly selective, looking for profitable market leaders who they can make AI-powered.

5. Know your target buyer & position the business to be attractive for them.

If that's PE, buyers want to see (a) profitability, (b) market leadership -- likely in a specific vertical, (c) stickiness, and (d) a SaaS + AI story. If that's BigTech, buyers want to see growth (ideally 30%+) + Rule of 40 + a clear fit with their 3-5 year roadmap.

Pranav Piyush,"How often do you take risks in marketing? New ideas, experiments, etc.

I've done over 300 hours of interviews with VPs and CMOs. I spend my days talking to marketers (the real ones, currently doing the work) and I think the one thing that ""creative"" and ""risk taking"" marketing teams have in common:

Someone at the top actually gives a shit.

They actually care about marketing. They have taste. They know that marketing is not some magic coin operated machine. That you must spend money to make money. That you must try new things and find new channels because the opportunities often appear where the competitors are not.

On Friday Matt and I were on a call with a VP Marketing at a $40M revenue IT company; he said they STOOD OUT because all of their competitors were running ads on one platform (you can guess) but none of them were running ads over here. Guess what working? Running ads where competitors were not active.

No annoying question from the CMO or CFO ""well our competitors are showing up in Google Search ads, why aren't we?"" Because that was an intentional strategy decision.

So it's not some rogue marketer: it's about the team, the leadership. Do they actually give a shit about marketing? Do they understand how marketing works? And what great marketing requires?

Listen to a Pranav Piyush here talk about how he is approaching advertising at Paramark (clip from a webinar we did on marketing experiments and testing)

Pranav Piyush,"Why are you asking about marketing attribution?

To measure marketing's impact?
Is it about getting credit? 
Is it about proving what was sales sourced vs. marketing sourced?
Is it to make a point to the CFO?

Pranav Piyush was VP Marketing at Bill . com and worked in Growth at Adobe and Dropbox. 

Today he spends his time trying to help marketers solve the measurement at Paramark; he brings a sharp point of view on attribution, channel performance, and how to actually prove what’s working across your paid media mix.

He makes a bunch of these concepts easy to understand, and my favorite principle of his is STOP TREATING YOUR CUSTOMERS LIKE MORONS (all caps).

This is a time of year when many marketers are thinking about channel bets and campaigns for 2026, and this is a good episode to revisit from the spring.

We covered:

• Real-world results from 7 B2B ad campaigns, including branded search, YouTube, billboards, and Performance Max
• Why most marketers are misusing the word “test” and how to run true experiments with lift, control, and causality
• How even small teams can apply experiment design (on a $10K budget or less) to make smarter spend decisions

Rahul Pandey,"One of my early career mistakes was believing that 'expertise' is difficult or impossible to attain.

A Staff Engineer at Pinterest exposed my mistake: within 2 weeks, he knew more about the codebase than me, even though I had been working in that area for a year.

Not only did he ramp up dramatically faster, he was able to understand the abstractions far better than me. 

After a few more weeks, he understood several abstractions and libraries more deeply than anyone in the entire company.

Expertise is not something you magically get when you become senior enough. It's a prerequisite for seniority, and you can start building expertise today.

You can become more knowledgeable than anyone as long as you narrow the scope appropriately. e.g. ""In one afternoon, I can understand more about the flags to configure git log compared to anyone on my team of 10 people.""

Rob Bowley,"Have ChatGPTs and other LLM based generative AI models already reached their zenith?

As Louie Bacaj says in the screenshot, once sites like StackOverflow go, the quality of the content fed into LLMs goes down.

LLMs will also cannibalise themselves as they begin to feed off more and more LLM generated content.

Additionally, it's likely more sites will block LLMs from harvesting content as they're eating into their business models (as Twitter & Reddit already have).

So it's quite possible LLM output quality has already reached a zenith point (there are reports that OpenAI ChatGPT quality has already gone down, but due to cost saving efforts).

Rob Litterst,"2025 will be remembered as the year when seemingly everybody lost confidence in their pricing. Among the top 500 players in SaaS and AI with transparent pricing, there were more than 1,800 pricing changes in 2025 alone.

That’s a staggering 3.6 pricing changes per company. Some, like Lovable, made a meaningful pricing change every 👏 single 👏 month in 2025.

I enlisted help from Rob Litterst, co-founder of pricing intelligence platform PricingSaaS, to give readers a tactical rundown of what happened and what (if anything) seems to be working in SaaS pricing.

Here's the TL;DR. Read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eptCbRBz

Trend 1: Credit models exploded in popularity, up 126% YoY

Most credits models fall into one of four buckets based on this 2x2: (a) is it more customer-friendly or vendor-friendly? & (b) are credits cost-based or value-based?

 - AI credits as product feature (see: HubSpot, Adobe)
 - AI credits as a creative sandbox (see: Lovable, Replit)
 - AI credits as enterprise infra (see: Figma, Cursor)
 - AI credits as a pass-through utility (see: Clay, PostHog)

Trend 2: The great re-bundling of AI

The more credit models flood the marketplace, the more customers will want to return to simplicity. In 2025 the pendulum swung toward credits. In 2026 it'll likely swing back toward simplicity and predictability.

Some of the biggest names in SaaS -- including Notion, Slack & Loom -- launched their first AI product as an add-on, and have since bundled that functionality into their core pricing model. Each had charged between $4 to $10 per user for an AI add-on. Now they're bundling AI and raising prices by between $2.50 and $5 per user.

Trend 3: Making seat-based pricing work harder

As companies introduce more complex pricing models, seats look customer-friendly by comparison.

Companies doing this well are layering additional value dimensions on top of the seat. Instead of a seat being just permission to log in, a seat becomes a gateway to more product capability, more automation, more consumption, more outcomes, or more flexibility.

Trend 4: The emergence of choose-your-own-pricing

For the past decade, vendors held most of the leverage: long-term contracts, rigid license models, and extractive pricing practices were staples of the legacy playbook. 

AI breaks that model. The demand for optionality is reshaping how SaaS companies think about pricing.

Rob Zuber,"What does data from over 10 million workflows teach you about what makes for a great engineering team?

This week I chatted with Rob Zuber, CTO of CircleCI — one of the world's largest CI/CD platforms.

Rob has one of the best vantage points in the industry to understand how great software gets built, and he came on the show to spill the beans!

Here are some of the things I learned:

↳ 📊 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗼 𝗳𝗮𝗿 — the worst and best teams often look the same on paper. Great teams don't obsess over process cleanliness; they obsess over the customer.

↳ 🧪 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗵𝘆𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 — instead of arguing between options A and B, just test them. You can talk all day or put it in front of customers and see what works.

↳ 🎯 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 — engineers make thousands of decisions daily. The more informed they are about business goals, the faster you move.

↳ 🔄 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱 — Rob cares more about how fast people can acquire new skills than the skills they already have. The world changes too quickly to hire for specific expertise alone.

↳ ⚖️ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 — programming languages, observability, CI/CD patterns: standardize. Developer environments and IDEs: let people choose. Too much local optimization kills global throughput.

↳ 🪞 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 — when something's not working, ask yourself: ""How did I contribute to that?"" It's the most important question a leader can ask.

It's still founder-led by Robert and Advith. 

They are deeply involved in every step.

They...

→ talk to customers (3-4 calls / day)
→ participate in design reviews (weekly)
→ understand business context (market)
→ work directly with design, eng, support, CS, sales

So many companies hand off product early on but we've seen it as so critical that it's one of the last things we wanted to hand off.

That said... given our multi-product vision, we need PMs to join the team.

Robert Eng,"INTRODUCING PYLON'S NEW BRAND!

Our previous brand developed organically from Robert Eng's original logo design and my very basic design skills.

We wanted our new brand to be more refined, and something that would scale with us longer-term.

We anchored the new brand in the idea of support, drawing inspiration from the structural supports of bridges and architectural plans to reflect strength, reliability, and scalability.

The general theme is light, includes shades of various bright colors that we can associate with new platform functionality, structures that we can combine to represent different product concepts, and is easy for non-designers to use.

This was technically our second office. The first was just working out of Robert and Advith's apartment during YC. Then after, we moved out as we brought on our first hire.

We (founders) both lived and worked out of this space for about a year until the team was ~10 people. The rest of the team would commute in and work together in the common area.

It was so packed by the end that our founding AE's desk was feet away from Advith's bed.

It was so much fun.

The space had such great energy and excitement.

Roberto Ferraro,"We often come across the motto 'Lead with Heart,' and, while it's intriguing, I believe it's not entirely accurate.

💡 Lead both with head and heart, instead.

This imho falls under the concept of 'Emotional Intelligence', which involves the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as the capacity to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.

But how do you achieve that?

🤔 Self-Awareness: recognize your feelings and their impact on those around you. It involves being honest with yourself and having confidence in who you are.

🌀 Self-Regulation: understand your emotions and think before reacting. Adapt to changes without losing control.

💞 Compassion: understand the feelings of others, treat them with care, without becoming emotionally involved in their experiences.

🤝 Develop Social Skills: build positive relationships and guide people effectively. Communicate transparently, resolve conflicts, and connect with others.

Curious to hear about how you work on developing your Emotional Intelligence, let me know in the comments 🙂👇

Roberto Ferraro,"In my life, I've seen many experts become somewhat annoyed by others asking questions. 


⛽️ However, questions are what fuel the engine of innovation.

Without them, many things we take for granted today would not exist.

Let me give you some examples.

🌐 The Internet: it began as a question about how computers at different locations could communicate with each other effectively.

📱 Smartphones: the development of smartphones started with questions about combining the functionality of a phone and a computer.

💡 Electricity: the exploration of electricity started with simple questions about the nature of lightning and static.

💉 Vaccines: the development of vaccines began with questions about how to prevent diseases and how the immune system works.

🚀 Space Exploration: questions about what lies beyond Earth led to the entire field of space exploration and technology.

How this relates with leadership?

Easy. 

Leadership is about fostering an environment where questioning is encouraged, as it drives innovation. 

When you come across people keen to challenge the status quo, don't block their path; support them instead, as they could become key contributors to your team's success.

Roberto Ferraro,"It took me years to learn one fundamental skill that is crucial for both leaders and engineers.


👂 Active Listening.

I'm sure you've already heard about it, but what does it mean to listen actively?

I like to break it down this way:

🔥 Focus: listen intentionally and make eye contact to show you are completely engaged.

👀 Observe: it might seem counterintuitive, but observing nonverbal cues is a part of actively listening to someone.

🧠 Reflect: consider the speaker's words to fully grasp their meaning and implications.

🙋‍♀️ Ask: Interact with the speaker by asking questions to clarify points and encourage further discussion.

⏸️ Breathe: pause and take a breath, allowing for better processing of information and preventing hasty reactions.

📝 Remember: journal after conversations, so in the follow-ups, you can demonstrate to the other person that you genuinely care and remember.

🤗 Empathize: connect with the speaker's emotions by showing understanding of their feelings and perspectives. Just ensure not to become overly involved.

For me, it took years to develop sufficient active listening skills, and I am still working to improve them.

And you? Ar you a good active listener?

Ryuichi Kubuki,"Pinch me: my book is this week's best-seller in Japan's largest book store:

The photo is from Kinokuniya Shinjuku, the flagship bookstore complex in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. It is probably the most famous and historic book retailer in Japan. It's a multi-floor shop with a massive selection, known for its wide range of specialized books. You can see two copies of The Software Engineer's Guidebook on the top shelf on the picture.

The Japanese version of The Software Engineer's Guidebook launched two weeks ago, translated by Ryuichi Kubuki (thank you for the phenomenal work!) published by O'Reilly Japan. O’Reilly told me that the book was temporarily out of stock for a few days, thanks to stronger-than-expected demand.

I love how the book's cover is very different from the English version - though if you zoom in you can see ""The Software Engineer's Guidebook"" in English showing up on the left side of the book.

If you live in Japan, you can order the book on Amazon Japan and find it in book stores: https://lnkd.in/e7FE2EXB

And also on the best seller list - and on the bottom right part of the photo - is  the Japanese version of the excellent AI Engineering book by Chip Huyen!

Sam Stahl,"Our founding AE interviewed with 20+ startups before choosing us. His framework for picking the right bet is brutal - and every candidate should steal it.

Sam Stahl was sitting in a hotel room in Mexico, injured from surfing, deciding where to work next. 

He realized he only had a few shots at finding the right early-stage company - each choice would cost him years, so he needed to choose wisely.

His filter:
1/ Seed stage only (mission intact)
2/ YC company (best hit rate for identifying winners)
3/ founders who sold the first $1M themselves (red flag when they hire sales to “figure it out”)
4/ technical product (he loves technical buyers)

Other founders promised he’d “buy a lambo” after selling $800K.
We told him: “You could join us and we could fail tomorrow. this is risky, and we don’t want to get your hopes up.”

That pragmatism sealed it.

He said he spent more time evaluating whether he wanted to work with us than our metrics.
“Do I like these people?”
“Are they good communicators?”
“Would I trust them in the trenches 12+ hours a day?”

That’s why Sam chose Recall.ai.

Sheril Mathews,"“Ask and you shall receive.”
But in leadership, it’s often the opposite.

Give and only then you shall receive. 👇

Give energy + engagement to get more energy + engagement.
Give more responsibility, in order to get more responsibility.

Give open communication, to get open communication.
Give trust, in order to be trusted.

Instead leaders inadvertently often do the opposite. 
Eg expecting people to trust them, but don’t trust their own people.

Leadership is an amplification mechanism. 
Whatever you do gets amplified and comes back to you 10X. 
There is nowhere to hide. 

You can do the opposite but it’s not sustainable in the long run.
This is not a morality position.
Rather, it’s a performance position. 

Teams with the above characteristics simply outperform others in the long run.

Shivam A.,"3 real-world examples of AI/ML Engineers -> their stack, challenges, and day-to-day focus.

With the increase in popularity of AI, roles such as AI Engineer and ML Engineer are becoming more and more popular.

In order to understand the roles much better, I’ve asked 3 AI/ML Engineers to share their real-world experience:
- How does their day-to-day look like
- What technologies do they work with
- Specific challenges they are facing
- How does the work differ from Software Engineering

These are the 3 engineers I had the pleasure of talking to:

3/ Continuously edit your work: Your first draft is never perfect. I always read and tweak my writing multiple times.

4/ Seek feedback from senior folks: Reach out to senior engineers to review and give feedback. Their perspectives are valuable.

And so I keep paying more attention to the fewer people who still write their original thoughts (without LLMs - you can tell how repetitive / pattern matching it gets with them, including on LinkedIn.)

By “interesting things” I mean when people share their own experiences, connecting the dots, own speculation/analysis etc.

Eg learnings they had on stuff they recently did, and so on.

Anyway, power to those who didn’t forget writing helps you think and reflect as well!

Sophie Z. Novati,"AI doesn't make you a 10x engineer at ALL times.

It makes you a 10-100x engineer temporarily, for very specific situations.

• When you can get a 10-hour task done in 1 hour
• When you can spin up 5 prototypes in ways you couldn't have before because it would have been too much effort
• When you can take on tasks you wouldn't have before because the ROI wouldn't have been high enough

But you need to know which situations this ^ actually works.

Here are 3 situations where you'll actually get things done 10x faster:
1. Research

❌ DONT: Painstakingly go through 10-20 links from Google and collect everything into a report
✅ DO: Ask Perplexity or GPT Deep Research and have it compile the entire report for you

2. Writing tests

❌ DONT: Write all your test cases by hand, line-by-line
✅ DO: The test setup, then use agent mode to have it generate all cases and test itself until the test passes

3. Communicating your impact

❌ DONT: Write your self-review and submit the first draft
✅ DO: Write your self-review (or have AI generate a first draft), then tell it to act as your manager crafting the highest quality, most clear review possible and give you suggestions. Work with it like a partner.

An interesting topic that Steve has never written about, but we went into detail: the importance of focused personal energy. In Steve's words:

""A topic that I don't think I've ever written about, but that is worth just throwing on the table, is that focused application of personal energy makes up for a lot of other deficiencies.

In startup mode, when you're talking about not having well-defined roles, if everybody's actually working in a focused way and they care about getting work done and they're applying a lot of energy: mistakes aren't a big deal! You just go in and you fix it. You've got the energy to do it.

If you're working in a super process-oriented way and people are thinking half about their home life, and they're checked out, and now they're 45 instead 27. Not that that's a universal pattern or anything, but if you don't have the same level of personal energy to correct mistakes, the mistakes linger. They affect more people, affect more downstream products, work products, and it just becomes a much bigger deal.""

Tanmay Munigala,"I just finished Louie Bacaj's excellent ""Timeless Career Advice For Software Engineers"" course!

Here are my top 10 takeaways from it:

1. Stick to startups/high-growth or big tech companies for a meaningful tech career

- Startups/high-growth companies to optimize for responsibility/scope
- Big tech companies to optimize for learning engineering best practices and compensation
- Work at companies where software directly ties to revenue (the product is the software itself)

2. Focus on ownership

- Stick to companies where software engineers are empowered to own and maintain their code (even after it's rolled out)
- Develop an ownership mindset - it's not your fault, but it's your responsibility

3. Deliver massive value

- What 20% of work will get you 80% of the results? Focus on that
- Make your code functional first
- Think about performance in B2C companies and maintainability in B2B companies

4. Develop an abundance mindset

- Find problems and opportunities to create more value in your product/system for your customers
- More problems you solve -> More resources for your company -> More rewards for you and your team

5. Build up your people skills

- Double down on relationships at work
- Empathise with your teammates and customers
- Learn to communicate effectively in conversations and meetings

6. Grow your influence through writing and speaking

- Write blog posts about your work - free credibility for you and your company
- Leverage opportunities to speak and present in meetings and presentations
- A public body of work >>> your resume
- Setup team and (eventually) company-wide initiatives. Ex: tech-talks, design reviews

7. Understand how promotions work

- Understand what the company values and deliver it. Different companies value different things
- Add value, make noise (in that order)
- Perform at the next level, and you'll be there soon

8. Leverage the power of 1 on 1 meetings

- Most important meetings of your career
- Take ownership of setting up 1 on 1's with key people - peers, product people, engineers and leaders (even from other teams) 

9. Nail your mid-year and annual reviews

- Take notes about your work and achievements weekly

Thiago Ghisi,"I’ve delivered 100+ large features over last 10+ years as an Engineer/Manager/Director, here is a lesson I learned 3 years ago that completely changed the game:

> A bad & unclear decision (yet intentional) is better than no decision in 99% of cases.

This might seem extreme/unproductive, but isn’t.

Without a larger plan, there are some technical decisions you just can’t make decisively. 

—> Are you all aiming for Future State A or Future State B? 

Teams often hedge and avoid making the small decisions because they don’t know what the big ones will be.

Not making a decision might end up being worse than any of the decisions on the table would have been. 

This especially shows up with architectural decisions, where teams don’t commit to one approach or another, and end up trying to be flexible enough to support both.

It is better to make a ""bad & wrong decision"" today (and fail/revisit and improve later) than no decision today and tomorrow with the ""illusion"" that a perfect decision or solution will appear tomorrow.

In my experience, most projects fail or get delayed not because developers are slow, but because the analysis paralysis of over-engineering that slows down the decisions that the team, the department or the company has to make to move things forward even when they don’t have all the info.

And, in my experience, when you have an aggressive deadline or release target (as it was almost always the case for me and my teams in those high-performing/hyper-growth companies), you will never have all the info you need. Or, when you have that, it will be way too late.

Practice: 24-Hour Decision Making.

Promoting the idea that making a decision & iterating on it even when there is some disagreement is better for the team in the long-term than spending a lot of time trying to local optimize a decision with a lot of unproductive discussions.

Having a winner or a losser in a discussion/decision is less important to us than moving forward and iterating on things as a team and getting real feedback from users (it could be even internal/alpha users) from the production environment (it could be from the staging in some cases as well) after have gone full cycle (from requirements to deployment) and end-to-end (from database to UX).

Thiago Ghisi,"Can you let go of your tech identity? And what happens when you do?

This week I spoke with my friend Thiago Ghisi, former Director of Engineering at Nubank, who quit his job seven months ago to go on a sabbatical. Not only that. After 15+ years in tech at companies like Thoughtworks and Apple, he is now starting a PhD in psychology.

So this isn't your typical ""I traveled the world"" story. Thiago used Claude Code to analyze 20 years of his own data — emails, notes, highlights, conversations — to better understand himself. And he is now putting everything to good use.

It was an incredible chat, and here are a few takeaways:

1) 𝗟𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗼 𝗼𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆 — it's hard to stop measuring yourself by productivity. The rational mind wants to do what “an engineering director should do”, but real discovery comes from following your curiosity.

2) 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 — if you optimize for short-term results, you'll keep doing what you always did. Connecting the dots takes months, not days.

3) 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 — Thiago parsed Gmail, LinkedIn, Kindle highlights, and years of notes into markdown repos. He traced when ideas first appeared in his life and found material for therapy exercises.

4) 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝘃𝘀 𝗱𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗲𝗹 — doing things because of deadlines or guilt is ""dirty fuel."" Clean fuel is working on something bigger than yourself, driven from the inside out rather than the outside in.

5) 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 — is it people who did one thing their whole life, or polymaths who reinvented themselves? Your answer reveals what you actually want.

Thiago Ghisi,"What type of manager are you?

Are you:
- An Operator, focused on stability and execution?
- A Guide, nurturing your team culture?
- A Driver, pushing for change? Or
- A Catalyst, inspiring your team to evolve?

These days I am reviewing the top articles we published this year, and I keep going back to the one about engineering manager archetypes, written with my friend Thiago Ghisi.

Thiago designed two axes along which you can place yourself — one about people vs execution, and another about stability vs change. There is so much you can understand about your role (and about yourself) by thinking about what you prioritize in these tradeoffs.

I find these quadrants useful in many ways:
– I can reflect on what I *default* to — the style that fits my personality best.
– I can reflect on what my team needs right now. E.g. is it time to nurture culture and tighten screws, or just create momentum and ship fast?
– I can reflect on my team composition. Do we overly skew in some direction? Do we need more (or less) of some of these?

It's a handy mental model that I added to my EM *tools*.

Thomas Dohmke,"This number (20 million+ users using GH Copilot) is wild because… most estimates put the # of all professional software developers in the world somewhere between 20-30 million.

GitHub Copilot either is getting ~100% adoption (unlikely) or it’s expanding the dev pool (likely!) or this number could include many people who are no -developers and not really “using” GH Copilot (could be - Microsoft doesn’t make it clear what qualifies as a user, but it’s safe to assume it’s a paid account!)

I’m assuming this number means the number of accounts that are paid for this plugin - and companies don’t like to pay for something their staff won’t use.

So we could see more people doing what accounts for professional software development with these LLM-powered coding tools! (So much for what many non-developers said recently: how AI tools would be reducing the need for software engineers? Which was nonsense to start with for anyone who built software and also used these tools…)

Torsten Walbaum,"This one communication shift took my friend from rejections to landing a senior 270k offer in big tech.

❌ Before, he'd get a question like, ""Tell me about how you made an impact on your team.""

And he'd answer like, ""Yeah, there was this one time... < speak for a minute on the story >... oh and there was this other time too... < another one >."" 

But the interviewer would already be lost by the end of the first one. They want someone senior, someone who can take a step back first.

I told him, you need to show your STRUCTURED thought process. Seniors speak in bullet points first, then details after.

✅ So he switched it to, ""Sure. When I'm making impact on the team, I like to think about 3 things--opportunity, effort, and risk. Each quarter, we map projects on these axes and one of the projects I proposed had high opportunity and medium effort/risk. Let me tell you more about that one, why I worked on it, and how I drove it forward...""

Once he switched to this, his interviewer's eyes started lighting up early on in his answer. He finally figured it out. Then, the offers followed.

So why is the second one better?
1. It shows you don't just jump into solutions.
2. It shows your decision criteria for action. You won't work on unimpactful work.
3. It gives your interviewer an overview first, almost like an ""agenda"" at the start of a presentation. They know what to expect.

Before you answer, take a step back, share your thought process, and show your structured thinking. Don't just dive in and start going off on stories.

Recently when working with Torsten Walbaum (ex-Rippling/Uber/Meta Director), I learned there was a framework this relates to called MECE--mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. When it gets applied, it looks a lot like the example my friend used to get his senior offers.

In today's High Growth Engineer post, Torsten shows you how to use it for 5 use cases as an engineer--interviews, investigations, debugging, explaining a system, and when proposing ideas.

Torsten Walbaum,"This framework I never knew I needed got me compliments on my communication within a week.

It's called MECE.

Huh? mice? No. MECE 😂. It stands for ""Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive."" It forces your communication to be structured.

Let's take an incident investigation as an example. Many times, engineers are dropping messages in the channel like throwing darts.

❌ Before: ""It could be the landing page. No, that's not it. Maybe seasonality? Nope, that's not it either... anyone have other ideas?""

✅ After: ""If signups are down, it's either actually down or it's a false positive. If it's a false positive, we can check for seasonality or a data issue. If it's an actual drop, it could be that it's iOS only, android only, or both. Let's narrow it down.""

MECE tells you to come up with all the mutually exclusive and many options as possible upfront, then narrow down and cross out. 

This has a few benefits:
1. You can literally SEE the structure via a tree this gives your communication and thinking
2. Once you see it, you can delegate each of those to others working on the issue
3. Finally, you can cross out each item on the tree as you go, and give accurate estimates to leaders of when it'll be resolved. No more, ""we're not sure when it'll be fixed. It's too ambiguous."" 

To apply it yourself, before your next message, think about how you can communicate using a ""tree structure"" like the one on the right. Avoid windy roads and darts.

Have you heard of MECE before and where else do you think you can use it?

Torsten Walbaum,"Deep Research mode is like having a junior McKinsey analyst on demand. It easily saves me 10+ hours per week. Yet it's one of the most underused AI functions that exists today. Here's how to use it for GTM ⤵️ 

(Huge shoutout to Torsten Walbaum from Operator's Handbook for the epic deep dive!)

1. Pick the right Deep Research tool

ChatGPT is the best general-purpose tool (for now) w/ the recent release of GPT-5 (no more model switching) and Agent Mode (ability to properly interact with websites).

Gemini is a great fallback option w/ more generous usage limits. Perplexity works well, too, and has more granular source controls.

2. Be aware of the limitations -- and build workarounds into your prompts

ChatGPT, for example, often shows bad judgment w/ picking sources. Point it to the highest quality *kinds* of sources & always ask it to provide in-text citations.

Context matters to get customized insights. Make sure to provide all the context that a human team member would need as well. 

And always ask for a research plan before getting started (Gemini does this by default) & specify an easy-to-digest report format.

3. Find a practical use case that delivers immediate value

Five ideas to get you started:
 - Step-by-step guide for large in-house projects like figuring out how to build (or re-build) marketing attribution
 - Researching competitors' ads strategies
 - Conducting an audit of your homepage or landing pages
 - Analyzing competitors' product features
 - Market assessment for international expansion

Good recruiters and interviewers know that senior programmers can translate their experience from one language/stack to another with ease.

This rule goes out the window for startups that haven’t figured out hiring yet, or don't have mature onboarding practices.

Victoria Crow Dog,"In college I loved using HackerRank.

Now... I'm proud to announce they've migrated to Pylon from Zendesk.

HackerRank serves thousands of companies and millions of developers who need technical support, and Zendesk wasn't cutting it.

They did a full migration, which included...
→ 140K+ contacts
→ 136K+ tickets
→ 129 users working out of Pylon
→ 400+ knowledge base articles 

The migration was completed with no disruption to their customers.


-- Why they migrated --

𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: V wasn't happy with Zendesk reporting. It was hard to create charts and calculate metrics she wanted. Getting numbers was always a pain. Now with Pylon, she has a strong set of default dashboards to work with and creating custom charts is quick and easy.

𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: Zendesk required buying separate AI products, while Pylon's AI features are embedded within the platform. Today they're power users of AI Assistants and will soon adopt our new AI Agents and AI Translation to support customers in any language.

𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Creating and maintaining knowledge content is much easier with Pylon. While Zendesk requires manual work to identify knowledge gaps and write content, Pylon does it for you. The team can now identify knowledge gaps with AI, draft articles based on previous responses, generate drafts into pre-made templates, check for similar articles, and translate articles to multiple languages. This saves the team an incredible amount of time.

𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱, 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗱𝗺𝗶𝗻: Zendesk required a lot of help to maintain. Pylon is much simpler to operate, while retaining the complexity required for their setup. They don't need a dedicated Pylon admin.

Vincent Pierri,"How to nail your next big talk 👇

I used to be terrified of public speaking. But I pushed through the nerves (with an assist from Big Pharma) & am absolutely glad I did.

If you're even a little bit like me, you'll want to bookmark this post from Vincent Pierri. He's personally delivered 300+ unique talks over the last 5 years. Now he's sharing his proven framework for a better 30 min keynote.

Read the full story in Growth Unhinged here: https://lnkd.in/eydNVYxG

The framework in four steps:

1️⃣ Nail the intro (5 minutes)

Every great talk begins with tension.

Think of your intro as the “hook.” It’s where you earn the right to keep people’s attention. 

If you lose the first five minutes, you’ll spend the next twenty-five trying to win them back.

2️⃣ Build trust (3 minutes)

Trust-building is where you prove you’ve walked the path. And your title isn't enough to get the audience on your side.

Three ways to do it:
 - Experience. A quick story of failure, experiment, or success.
 - Research. Credible data, case studies, or benchmarks.
 - Relatability. A short personal story that shows you’ve been in their shoes.

3️⃣ Deliver three main points (3 × 6 minutes)

Three points is the sweet spot. Enough to feel substantial. Not so much that people forget them by lunch.

Each point follows the same mini-framework:
 - One-Liner (1 min)
 - Analogy (2 min)
 - Examples (3 min)

4️⃣ Close strong (4 minutes)

Too many talks fizzle at the end. 

Instead, close with a one-two punch:
 - Final Story (2 min)
 - Call to Action (2 min)

---

I can't wait to try out this framework for my next talk. Hope you find it as useful as I did 🙏

Vojsava (Sava) Livadhi,"A Mother's Plea: Seeking AlphaFold Experts for a Rare Cancer Mission

This is the most important post I'll ever write. My son is turning 21 tomorrow, August 23rd. For the last 2.5 years, he has been bravely battling Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), a rare and under-researched cancer.

ASPS is driven by a specific gene fusion protein (ASPSCR1-TFE3). This protein is the engine of his cancer, yet we lack a detailed understanding of its structure. This is where we see a path for hope, and where I desperately need your help.

We are searching for brilliant minds—individuals, researchers, or institutions—with expertise in using AlphaFold to create a 3D model of this specific fusion protein. Creating this structural ""blueprint"" is not just an academic exercise; it's a critical step that could allow us to identify this protein's vulnerabilities. The ultimate goal is to find existing, approved drugs that could be repurposed to ""fit"" and disable this engine, opening up new, out-of-the-box treatment strategies.

The power of the LinkedIn community is immense. A simple share could connect this plea to the one person or lab in the world that can help us move the needle in the fight against this rare disease.

My birthday wish for my son is hope, powered by action. Please, not only share this post but also ask your network to share it. You never know whose screen it might cross.

Thank you for your time and support.

Some friendships fade. Some friendships stretch across decades, deployments, life, loss, and every version of who we’ve become.
These two didn’t just step up to the line — they walked right over it.
Staff Sergeant Jason Richards, USMC
 Corporal Jed Richards, USMC
We grew up together. We got in trouble together. We figured life out the hard way. And they put on the uniform and carried a weight most people will never understand.

Wendy Harris (can you make sure they both see this...going to be like hearding cats. Godspeed). 
First memory of Jed: 3 years old, in a diaper, running laps around a basketball goal like it was the Indy 500.
Not much has changed — still too small to play and still wearing diapers, just a different brand (according to him).

Jason — the quiet one until the moment it mattered. The one who runs toward the fire when everyone else steps back. Never had to say much — because he showed up.

I didn’t serve. They did.

But I learned from them — loyalty, accountability, and doing hard things without needing applause for it.

Now your turn.

Who in the service are you personally thankful for?
Before anyone gets dramatic:
Yes — we honor all veterans and active service members.

But today is about the individuals who shaped your life.
Drop a name. Tell a story. Let them be seen while they’re still here to hear it.

Wendy Vang,"Pylon's 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 is our Analytics.

That ends today. 

We've completely rebuilt our Analytics from scratch.

Here's what we tried, what we screwed up, and what's coming.


𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟭, The Basics (Nov 2023)

Our first attempt at analytics was quite loved by customers.

At the time our customers were mostly small startups with simple needs. We built an out-of-the-box set of dashboards that covered the common use cases of support analytics (SLA-tracking, CSAT, TTFR, TTR, basic filtering...).

As we moved upmarket...
1/ Everyone was requesting custom metrics
2/ Queries were becoming inefficient and slow

We needed an upgrade.


𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟮, Advanced Reporting (June 2024)

We knew custom reporting was going to be blackhole of work that long-term led to fully customer-customizable dashboards. 

We had four choices: 
1/ Do nothing for now
2/ Do custom work per customer 
3/ Build full custom reporting in-house 
4/ Use an embeddable analytics vendor

At the time Pylon was under 10 people total and we had no capacity to do the frontend work so we chose Option 4 (use a vendor). This was the first time we chose to not build a core feature like this in-house as we ultimately want full control of the end-user experience.

We built out the new reporting with the chosen vendor over ~3 weeks.

On the surface the new reporting looked really good (not visually, but in terms of functionality). You could add custom charts of any type, create custom formulas, label the Y and X axis, and effectively build most of what you would want. It was really great for demos.

But in practice it was incredibly hard to use, lacked core capabilities (like the ability to filter off of dynamic custom fields), and visually looked not stylized to the rest of the product.

We started to discover some of these issues during the implementation, but it still felt like there was more upside than downside so we released it.

Feedback was not great but we hoped our vendor would fix changes quickly. Unfortunately they weren't fast enough and we lost confidence that they would be a good long-term solution.

As a stop-gap we also built out a data warehouse integration so customers could export their data back to Snowflake or BigQuery to use with their own BI tools.

Finally, a few months ago the vendor told us they were being acquired. That was the final straw. We needed to move off ASAP.


𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟯, New Reporting (Today)

Today's release is back to being built entirely in-house. It's been rolled out in beta to all customers with an option to flip back to old analytics until we plug some custom reporting gaps.

This time we have the capacity to do it right between Wendy (prev product design at Amplitude), Matt, and Tom.

Wes Kao,"After landing a $350k offer in big tech, my friend quoted this interview tip as what helped him the most in landing the job.

Don't answer the question. Answer the question BEHIND the question.

Here's an example:

• Interviewer asks... ""Tell me about your biggest failure""
• You respond by telling them about a big project that didn't ship on time and everyone moved on. That feels like a failure, right?

The problem is, the question behind the question was, ""How well do you learn from your big failures?"" So you can still tell the story about your biggest failure, but you need to touch on what you learned from it! Every answer you give uncovers more to the interviewer about how you are to work with (the pie below).

Here are some more examples:
• Biggest disagreement -> Can you work with others? (not a chance to brag about swapping teams due to arguments)
• A project you are proud of -> How large is your scope and do you approach projects methodically?
• A time when you missed a deadline -> Do you let others know ahead of time when your estimate is off? How do you approach your relationship with stakeholders?

Each question has something underlying the interviewer is trying to get at.

Figure out what it is. Answer THAT question and you'll see the offers start coming in.

--
The thing is, this framework isn't just useful for interviews. You can use it when you're fielding questions during a presentation, or when you're dealing with hard questions from your manager on why something hasn't shipped.

Wes Kao,"Delegation is hard. Especially if you don't have formal authority. But with this framework, I broke through my ""delegation imposter syndrome"" in 1 week.

It's called CEDAF, and it does a few key things:
1. It gives you a way to influence without authority through excitement
2. It ensures the other person does the task how you envision (or both agree to)
3. It prevents the project from going sideways once it begins

So here's the 5-step CEDAF process with examples:
1. Comprehension
Explain it in a way that's easy to understand. Start by explaining the high-level steps, then dig into each one individually where they need more details.

2. Excitement
Get the person excited by sharing what's in it for them. 

For example, ""This will be great for your visibility"" or ""<x> contributes to <y big initiative> in a positive way.""

3. Derisk
Think to some of the things they might get blocked by early on, and address those upfront. You can also ask them what they see as risks.

Ask, ""What risks do you see?"" and ""How are you considering approaching it?""

4. Align / Accountability
Ensure they feel it's doable and accept the challenge.

Ask, ""Do you feel like this is doable?"" or ""Do you feel like you have a clear picture of what ‘done’ looks like?""

5. Feedback loop
Follow up in the earliest, non-micromanagey feedback loop that makes sense to ensure everything is going as you discussed. Adjust based on that initial check-in.

Since learning CEDAF, I managed to ship 3+ projects through others. Big kudos to Wes Kao for initially creating and sharing it.

Yaakov Carno,"We're in a new UX era for software: the era of the prompt bar. That doesn't mean you can just add a prompt bar & move on. What 40+ of the best AI-native companies are doing:

I enlisted Yaakov Carno to map out AI prompt journeys across products like Canva, Notion, Vercel, Lovable, Airtable (& lesser known AI companies). He traced every step from homepage to first value. 

The 7 most interesting observations ⤵️

1. Consider offering multiple entry points: the prompt bar OR a visual UX. 

Gamma and Wix are two 🔥 examples. Gamma even has 3 options.

2. Increase relevance with a ""hidden"" step between the prompt bar & output. 

Lovable, for example, has a series of onboarding questions to collect more context.

3. Don’t just tell users they can “generate anything.” Show them specific, meaningful examples that connect to their job-to-be-done. 

Canva, for instance, has a visual use case selector w/ a category & sub-category.

4. Use the prompt bar to educate users about what kind of tasks your product supports. 

Zapier there are sample prompts for lead management, customer support, marketing & growth, and project mgmt.

5. Distinguish whether the AI is a copilot or autopilot. 

Notion nails this with a mix of placeholder text, surrounding CTAs, and examples that clearly convey what you can do and why.

6. Integrate context, data, and sources at the beginning.

bolt.new has a new minimalistic design that focuses only on importing from Figma and GitHub. Constraints increase the likelihood of relevant, valuable outputs.

7. Add a fun factor to make the experience feel different & maybe a bit magical.

Playfulness can lower hesitation. Riff and Leap use “Shuffle” or “Surprise me” icons to encourage exploration.

Yangshun Tay,"One of the biggest regrets in my career was not being aware of engineering career levels early enough.

Learn from my mistake, I don't want the same to happen to you.

Understanding what is expected of each engineering level would have helped me make better decisions earlier in my career.

I put together this mega engineering levels cheatsheet from junior levels up to staff level. 

If you are an engineer, go through it and see if you are due for a promotion, or identify gaps and work towards the next level.

If you are a student, get a sense of what is expected of you as you progress in your career.

Note: These are general guidelines for the standard tech company, using Meta and Google as reference. There can and will be deviations/exceptions depending on company culture and priorities (e.g. some high level engineers still write a lot of code).

Yoona Kim,"WELCOMING YOONA KIM TO PYLON!

I am so so excited.

She's joining as our Founding Product Marketer.

In Yoona we found someone who:

1/ Wants to work exceptionally hard
2/ Be fully in-person with the team
3/ Create daily viral posts  


The Pylon community will get tremendous benefit...

1/ With someone dedicated to content, releases will become more organized and digestible for customers. Our LinkedIn posts are great but customers deserve an easier way to discover what we've been cooking up.

2/ B2B marketing is changing and Yoona gets it. Content needs to not only be educational, but be punchy and fun, and have stories and characters. We should be drawing inspiration not from other B2B companies, but creators like Mr. Beast.  

3/ On day 1 Yoona was able to produce our Discord release video, two new hire videos, and started developing our product marketing plan. Imagine what's coming next.

Yoona Kim,"I should not be sharing this.

But I built a Tone-of-Voice GPT for Pylon—and it actually works.

For context, up until a couple months ago all of Pylon's content had been written by me.

Then a couple of months ago our new Product Marketer Yoona joined.

Since then, I've learned I am very very picky when it comes to Pylon's ""voice"".

So as we're interviewing candidates for new marketing roles and asking them to write, I'm realizing it's near impossible to describe exactly what I'm looking for. 

So as I was trying to describe what I was looking for in a Google Doc to a candidate, I decided to prompt engineer my way out of this.

I went into ChatGPT (using o3) and started describing what I wanted.

""""""
Make a ""tone of voice"" guide for Pylon that can be fed to a OpenAI GPT prompt that my team can use to edit their writing samples to conform to the tone of voice for all of our copy.

The brand tone is:
- Concise
...[hidden]

The brand tone is NOT:
- ""Sales-y""
...[hidden]

Industry specific:
- If we reference customer support or service, never say ""customer service"" always say ""customer support""
...[hidden]

For LinkedIn in particular:
- First line should always be under 140 characters so that it does not wrap when viewed on mobile
...[hidden]

For Emails:
- Keep the signature very short
...[hidden]

Samples of existing Emails:
...[redacted]

Samples of existing posts:

Comment ""PYLON CUSTOMER SUPPORT"" and your email and I'll shoot it over to you!

⚡ Roland Ligtenberg,"You might not have heard of Housecall Pro, but it's a vSaaS juggernaut doing hundreds of millions in ARR. A surprising way they got there:

Cold calling, even when the product started at only $4/mo 🤯. The math on that is hurting my brain.

⚡ Roland Ligtenberg, co-founder & SVP of Growth, just joined the Mostly Growth podcast & shared Housecall Pro's unconventional growth journey. 

My biggest learnings:

1. Start w/ where your customers get their business. In the trades, that's still over the phone. 

Housecall Pro cold called prospects even when their product was $4/mo. It's a core part of the GTM today even though they've got a free trial/PLG offer and a $59/mo. price point.

Why it works: (a) their prospects still answer the phone, (b) Housecall Pro solves a big problem for them, (c) they've been able to scale cold calling through outsourcing, & (d) their product is sticky once it's bought.

2. Find the hyper-specific jargon for your sub-verticals & use it in your outreach.

Housecall Pro sells into 55 (!) different sub-verticals (plumbers, electrical, etc.). Each could have it's own vertical software. 

When they talk about fittings & specs, plumbers see that this is software purpose-built for them. They're using AI to help with hyper-specific personalization & seeing the results in conversion data. 

3. Organic word-of-mouth is a huge acquisition channel. But you don't need to do referral links/credits to track and grow WoM.

A lot of WoM growth shows up as direct traffic to the website. It's hard to see what moves it. Housecall Pro regularly checks in w/ customers and directly asks ""have you recommended us to any of your friends?"" This isn't NPS, this is actual referrals. 

Roland measures this data & tracks it month-over-month & quarter-over-quarter. This unlocks the ability to run growth experiments like sending pros Yeti mugs/coolers, running sweepstakes, or paying for beer at local meetups.

4. The magic of vSaaS is in the layer-cake strategy. But the first layer needs to be fully baked before adding more.

Housecall Pro started w/ scheduling & payments. That's still their hero offering even though they have 12+ products incl. payroll, FinTech, and 24/7 call answering. The key is to figure out who the prospect is when they come to the front door, that way Housecall Pro can take them to the right room.

🔁 Umberto Nicoletti,"How can a power adapter set off a 25-year career in tech?! 🔌

Today we published an incredible guest article from my friend Umberto Nicoletti, Director of Product & Engineering at Proemion, who explored lessons learned throughout his journey in tech.

He talks about Open Source, self-doubt, coaching, communities, and how a forgotten power adapter at a conference in Germany ended up shaping his entire career!

Here are some of the things I learned from Umberto:

🎯 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗜𝗸𝗶𝗴𝗮𝗶 — the best careers sit at the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can get paid for. When you're aligned with all four, everything becomes easier.

🎲 𝗖𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝘂𝗰𝗸 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗮 — luck plays a huge role in careers, but it can be cultivated. Show up, contribute to communities, and stay in touch with interesting people.

🧰 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘀 — being a generalist pays off. The ability to move across domains creates versatility that unlocks unexpected career paths.

🔭 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲 — treat every interaction as part of an infinite game. When you're playing for the long term, occasional setbacks become just wrinkles in a larger journey.

🪴 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 — it's not lonely at the top unless you choose it to be. Coaching, communities, and peers are invaluable for fighting impostor syndrome and growing as a leader. Don't wait to join the conversation.

My favorite quote from the piece: ""Careers are very much by chance, but you always want to have a clear roadmap of what you wanna do"" — Lisa Su, CEO of AMD

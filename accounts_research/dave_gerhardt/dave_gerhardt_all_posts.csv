"Let's make the CMO be the CMO again. 

Your CMO should be the best storyteller at your company. 

Full stop.

That's my bias, but I'm sticking with it.

The CMO is not the CFO (crazy, right?)

The CMO should be company's best storyteller.

Is the other stuff important? Of course it is. You need metrics. You need reporting. You need data. You need so many things.

But if you don't nail the story to your market, a clear POV, and true differentiation -- none of the other stuff will matter.

And if the CMO can't get the company (internal team) excited and rallied around the company mission, how will you ever be able to get strangers (customers) onboard?

The most valuable asset in any company is its story. And the CMO must be the chief custodian of that story. 

Not a bean counter. 

Not a data wrangler. 

A storyteller.

(my opinion)

A CMO who cannot craft a compelling story - who cannot articulate a clear point of view or highlight what truly sets the company apart - will find that all the data in the world won’t move the needle.

PS. This is more important now than ever. In a world of AI slop and sameness and customers who don’t actually believe your claims in marketing - you need a strong POV and great storytelling.

"I’m excited to share an important update about the leadership structure at Exit Five.

After two years running our business as COO, I’ve promoted Dan Murphy to CEO. 

My role as Founder & Owner does not change; more on that in a bit. 

This promotion isn’t a shift in how we operate — it’s a recognition of the role Dan already plays in our business and a critical step in preparing us to scale and maximize our potential in the years ahead.

In the book Traction they talk about the ideal pairing between the Visionary (Founder) and the Integrator (Operator).

That describes the partnership Dan and I have well:

• Visionaries are creative, strategic, restless, full of ideas, often bald - and honestly a bit dangerous without the right counterpart. They are known to start fires and run.

• Integrators bring structure and process. They turn chaos into clarity. They run the business, manage teams, keep the trains moving, and allow the Visionary to focus where they are most valuable. That’s exactly what Dan has done since joining two years ago.

Dan has pushed me. He challenges every late night and weekend idea. He puts out the fires that I start. He sweats every dollar we spend. And he has consistently held a higher bar for what this company can be. Even if it's sometimes annoying and I want to yell at him :) That's what we need. That's the partner you want.

Exit Five has gone from “Dave’s cute little solo business” to a real company with real scale because of the structure, stability, and leadership he has brought to us.

His growth over the last two years — from VP Marketing in his last job to a true operator today — has been incredible to watch.

Like in baseball free agency, you get paid for the job you've already done. So this title as CEO reflects who Dan has become and what our company needs for the future. 

We have big plans for 2026, 2027, and beyond. 

I am working harder on this than I have on anything in a while and having the most fun of my career.  Splitting up the CEO and Founder roles will make us all more successful for the future.

My superpowers are vision, content, product, and strategy. Working on copy, hooks, headlines, positioning, storytelling, and training our team to do the same. 

The best role for me at Exit Five is to be editor-in-chief and raise the bar on our ideas, our content, products, and the way we show up in the market. That’s where I can create the most value.

This move gives us the foundation we need for a more ambitious Exit Five — one with more impact, more innovation, and more opportunity for our team.

Please join me in congratulating Dan on a well-earned promotion to CEO of Exit Five. 

This is an amazing milestone for our little business, and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.

NOTE: He started wearing the fanny pack before becoming CEO. But that's how I knew it was meant to be.

Also, this means I am now in full-time #FounderMode for those keeping score at home.

"If you only read one post about marketing this week it should be this one.

We are drowning in AI slop.

But I am going to throw you a life jacket.

ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, this agent or that. It's all great. But here's what you really need to know about the craft of marketing.

• People do not care about your company.
• They don't care about your product and your features.
• They don't care about the new integration you just shipped.

What they care about is themselves. 

We are biologically wired to be selfish.

So: if you can talk to someone about themselves, you’ll have their full attention.

Focus on helping them first.

What is the selfish benefit to them? Why should they care?

Here are five timeless principles you can think about for your customers:

1. Make Me Look Good

Whether it’s to a boss, their team, or their industry, people are wired to care about status. Can you help them impress someone? Can you give them an edge? Can they copy/paste your idea and look smart in the next meeting? I remember impressing my boss when I was 23 year old marketer being asked to build a marketing plan for a product launch for the first time. I had no idea what to do, found a great resource from HubSpot blog (the OG) and used it. She was impressed.

2. Save Me Time

Time is the one thing nobody has enough of. If you can help someone do something faster, with less friction or fewer steps, that's the way. People will pay for time savings. BUT they have to believe this. Can't just be a marketing claim. You need proof. Show the receipts. The examples.

3. Make Me Money

Capitalism seems to be the best system that exists in the world. I don't make the rules I am just observing. It doesn't seem like someone has created a better way, so yes - money matters. And whether they will admit it or not, your customers want to make more money (because they are people). Whether directly or indirectly, people are tuned in to ROI. If you can help someone drive revenue, get more leads, reduce churn, or land a raise then you’ve got their attention. Again though: MUST BE BELIEVABLE. So you must have PROOF.

4. Help Me Avoid Pain

We are wired to avoid pain. We'd almost always rather avoid pain than get some type of gain. No one likes to look stupid, feel behind, or get in trouble. If you can speak to something they’re secretly worried about -- a mistake, a missed goal, a clunky process -- and show a way out, they’ll lean in.

5. Help Me Reach The Next Level

Great marketing often speaks to ambition. Career growth. Mastery. Confidence. People want to feel like they’re getting better — at their job, in their life, as a person.

***

There's a lot of noise in marketing right now because of tech/AI, but I'm more bullish than ever on understanding the timeless principles in marketing, and that starts with understanding people.

I hope these are helpful for whatever you're working on right now.

"Here are 16 timeless lessons for B2B marketers:

Forget AI. You need timeless lessons if you want to grow your career in marketing. 

Here's my list that I created based on growing my career from PR intern to CMO:

1. Forget acronyms (MQL, ABM, blah blah blah you don't need it)
2. The story is the strategy 
3. Think hard about “offers” 
4. Push your team past incremental thinking 
5. Get on the same page as sales 
6. Don’t “be” finance and ops...partner with them 
7. Master internal communication 
8. Articulate the strategy 
9. Think short-and-long-term 
10. Understand what the CEO cares about 
11. Make hiring your job, not a side project 
12. Create your own momentum 
13. Your job is to get the job done 
14. But do the job first, before hiring externally 
15. Get comfortable making bets without perfect data 
16. Spend the budget (all of it, or else)

"Please don't get mad about this, but here's the truth I've learned: you get freed up to do great marketing when you are not under constant pressure to deliver a direct response on everything you do.

When every activity is not measured by the exact ROI of that activity... you are actually able to do good marketing.

You'll be able to do things that stand out, generate awareness, capture attention, build trust, create loyalty, and maybe for once actually get people sharing things about your brand.

Word of mouth is the most powerful thing a brand could have. But you don't get it when ringing the cash register is the desired outcome from every brand touch point.

OK, but how? 

Everyone always wants to know how. 

Because inside of the company, the CFO wants to know how much everything costs. The VP Sales is on your ass about the leads. The CEO is standing up in front of the board next week and she needs to show growth.

You have to educate people on how good marketing works.

I have a ton of product ideas; but I have no idea how design and engineering work. 

So they have to explain that stuff to me.

Same is true in marketing. I believe it is a true skill, a craft. And when deployed properly, it's a strategic growth lever for the business.

Is it not worth having a strong POV on what great marketing looks like? 

To teach your company, to earn the trust of the CEO, CFO, VP Sales, board, internal teams? 

You must be able to articulate what good looks like and why marketing is not just direct response.

Now of course the dream scenario is you find out the CEO gets marketing before you join the company and you don't have to do as much of this ... but you might not always be in that position (or have control to get that information, or know it's real, etc.)

But if you didn't think part of the job in marketing was to educate people on how good marketing works; then it might be better to switch careers and become an engineer, show up to work at 10 AM and code silently in the dark until 7 PM and go home. 

OK that little paragraph was unnecessary. Literally no reason for engineers to catch strays from my LinkedIn post on this fine Thursday.

But anyway... my point is this:

Internal marketing is the most underrated marketing channel; I did not make this rule. 

I am just giving you my observations from my career. 

I'm still doing calls weekly with CEOs and Founders advocating for marketing; they still need education.

It's part of the job.

How do you educate your peers about how marketing works? Not in a patronizing way, but explaining how customers get information, how they buy, why the long game matters?",648.0,159.0,10.0,817.0,3.21,Contrarian,Marketing,Contrast/But,Observation/Opinion,Text-only,"Please don't get mad about this, but here's the truth I've learned: you get freed up to do great mar","Please don't get mad about this, but here's the truth I've learned: you get freed up to do great marketing when you are not under constant pressure to","Please don't get mad about this, but here's the truth I've learned: you get freed up to do great marketing when you are not under constant pressure to",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davegerhardt_please-dont-get-mad-about-this-but-heres-activity-7407381622724980738-4XHm?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD0I0qgBC_ob3spBi0gOcg7LEDgj2HKVHDE,2025-12-18T11:30:01.353Z,idea_legos_nacho,16.0,0.0,202.1,
"The CEO should put the Product team and Marketing team together.

There should be a vision. And a roadmap. And regular launches. Some small. Some big. And this becomes the operating system for the company.

"Confession: I changed my mind about something I used to DESPISE.

I hated them.

Their color.

Their fur. The claws. The way they pooped indoors in a bin (still weird).

And they gave me terrible allergies.

When my wife and I started dating she had a cat, and I told her it was either ME or the CAT (she chose me).

But then something weird happened. After the family dog died, my kids asked if we could get kittens. Obviously I'm a sucker and was willing to ignore my own feelings to appease my children, so we got not one but two cats. A bonded pair.

Within days the cats (of course) decided that I was their chosen human. They knew I had spoken ill of their kind. 

And they won me over!

They melted my cold grey heart and at the same time:

My allergies magically disappeared. 

So now I tell everyone that I can: it's OK to change your mind on a deeply held belief. I was once a cat hater. I mean I was deep on Twitter and in sub-Reddits talking shit about cats at every opportunity I had.

And now here I am, confessing my love for cats to the 180,000 people that follow me on LinkedIn.

"Here are the top AI tools for marketers right now

Personally, my list only has ONE tool and it's because 99.9% of my time is spent with my friend ChatGPT. Just strolling through the woods in Vermont talking to my little robot. I know, I know.

But we happen to run the top community for a huge group of marketing professionals, so I took to the streets (aka the message boards) to ask the Exit Five community their most used AI tools right now.

No affiliations with any of these companies, not getting paid to post this; truly a finger on the pulse type of thing - here are the 15 tools that come up the most in Exit Five right now.

1. ChatGPT / Custom GPTs

The catch-all workhorse. Campaign names. Research. Outlines. Internal playbooks. If you haven’t already: build a brand-trained GPT that gives you 20 campaign name options in seconds. Helps me go from 0 to 1 faster. Get the bad ideas out of the system.

2. Claude

They say it's better for long documents and repurposing. Drop in your last year of content and get a pattern analysis you definitely weren’t going to do manually. I just like the name. Claude.

3. Canva Magic Studio

Canva rocks. When you need designer-level output… without a designer. Spin up carousels, ads, and visuals in minutes. Even makes me look good.

4. Descript

Edit video like a doc. Cut filler. Pull clips. Export. Done in a fraction of the time.

5. Perplexity

Your research intern. Competitor tracking. Trend scans. Summary + sources.
Great when someone Slacks you “quick question” and you need to look prepared. Do you all like this better than Google? Than ChatGPT? It's different? How

6. SurferSEO

SEO briefs and optimization that make ranking feel less like a gamble. Great name btw.

7. Ahrefs + Frase

Find old posts losing traffic. Patch the gaps. Win back rankings.

8. Make

Lead routing and follow-up workflows that run while you sleep.

9. Zapier (+ Agents)

Reporting, notifications, cross-tool workflows. Everything that used to require ops help.

10. Clay

List building and enrichment on autopilot.
Find contacts. Pull data. Build prospect lists that would've taken days.

11. ElevenLabs

Voice cloning for audio versions of your content. You type. “You” talks. I want to use this for our podcast ads but I think the real mean sounds more authentic?

12. Vercel V0

Landing pages that practically build themselves, with auto A/B tests baked in.

13. Flourish

Data visuals and interactive maps that make your spreadsheet look like a crime scene. Uh. OK? Is that a good thing?

14. GenSpark

Upload data. Get insights and a deck. No more begging for analytics support.

15. NotebookLM

Drop in transcripts, internal docs, and case studies. Get messaging ideas, customer language, objections, topics - all from your own data.

"Remote work requires an incredible amount of discipline. Not for everyone.

I think that the ""back to the office"" crowd often has a narrative that remote work is easier.

That remote workers are slacking off while the ""real professionals"" are grinding it out in the office.

But I think there's another angle to this:

Working from home exposes everything. No boss watching over your shoulder. No colleague pressure. No artificial energy from office chaos. Heck, you could be ripping the vape pen all day at work if you wanted to.

Remote work makes it more about the results (and I like that, btw)

You can't hide behind being the office social butterfly who everyone loves but whose output is average. Maybe you're fun, funny, amazing to get a coffee with - but not actually doing any real work??

Remote you can't mask weak skills with great small talk or being the person who always organizes the lunch order. But he's so nice! So fun to be around! 

Well as it turns out Todd sucks at his job...

Remote work kills the performance theater, which was always one of my biggest beefs of office culture.

Don't get me wrong - there's value in being together. I feel it every time we get our team together and there are times that I wish we all DID work together in an office.

But let's be honest about what also happens in offices: 

• People spending three hours looking busy instead of productive. 
• People hang around the office until a certain time vs going home when the work is done for the day
• People getting promoted (or hanging around at a company longer than they should) because they're likable, not because they are delivering results.

The truth? Both can work. But they demand different skills.

Remote rewards discipline. Focus. I need to take a shower and put on real clothes to remind myself that this is work - even though it's remote.

I don't think the remote work is for everyone. 

It requires a certain level of self starter, get shit done, can you show up and make things happen on a day when you don't have any motivation.

Editor's Note: I am also extremely biased toward remote work during this phase of my life (in my 30s, with young kids, etc.) 

The office was the absolute best place to be in my 20s and I am sure a few years from now when my kids don't need me as much and aren't around as much, I'll be making my way back to an office of some kind.

Anyone can have a podcast. Anyone pump out content on LinkedIn. You can do webinars and upload videos to absolutely no one. There is almost zero price of admission.

"Happy (official) two year Exit Five anniversary to my guy and our COO Dan Murphy.

In the book Traction and the EOS framework, they talk about the ideal leadership pairing between the Visionary (founder) and an Integrator (the operator).

That framework is exactly what makes Dan and I work so well together.

Most entrepreneurs fall into the Visionary category: creative, strategic, restless (yep), starting fires everywhere (can confirm), big on ideas, lower on follow-through (my bad).

Integrators:

- Bring structure
- Turn chaos into clarity
- Run the business
- Manage teams
- Keep the trains running on time
- Free the Visionary to do Visionary things

Candidly, Dan can be a complete pain in my ass - but that is exactly what I need. 

Dan pushes me. He sweats every dollar we spend. He questions every late night idea we have. He has even mastered the art of putting out every fire that I start.

This is the the reason Exit Five has become a real business, a real company, and something that has already outgrown my name. It's also a profitable growth machine that is making a real impact on thousands of people around the world (I have the receipts in my Apple Notes; the impact goes well beyond B2B marketing).

Dan will tackle any problem, big or small. He's on calls with my accountant, talking to our lawyer, he's interviewing candidates, he's fixing landing pages, he's coding, he's asking me why I spent $25 on a Jimmy John's sandwich at the airport. 

But more importantly he knows what we *can* be and pushes me to raise the bar. Have a high f-ing bar is one of our core values now.

Before this I used to brag about how little I was working, and now I know why: I did not have a clear purpose. I was alone. 

That has all changed in the last two years and I can confidently say that I'm in the prime of my career and we have a great business with product market fit because this guy took my call two years ago. 

His comp was heavily weighted on performance in that first year too. He took a bet on himself, smashed the goals (turns out we're both competitive) and it's be game on ever since.

He's also a good person (imagine that!) A great Dad. Husband. And the guy I would call in a pinch, for anything.

He's also grown - big time. Maturing. Evolving from a VP Marketing to a true COO. And I know there's more to come. 

Thanks for 2 great years Dan. I hope we don't have a public falling out one day where we're talking shit about each other on Twitter!!! <3

Please go follow him on LinkedIn if you are not already.

PS. We celebrated by playing TPC Scottsdale two weeks ago after the E5 team offsite and had a blast. I think it was $500 per person for 18 holes, but we put it on the Ramp card because it's a write off!

"Read this if you need to learn about AI and SEO:

What's amazing about our view from the balcony with Exit Five is that we see hundreds (maybe thousands) of questions from marketers every year, so I feel like we have a strong sense of what topics are important and top of mind.

There are a million questions about AI, but the loudest one over the last year has been about AI and SEO.

- I am noticing my personal habits changing to use ChatGPT more
- My boss is asking me to look into it and how we rank in AI Search

- Our organic traffic has gone down...
- The board has some opinions about AI and SEO and I need to get smart on the topic

So our team has put together a free AI SEO course; 100% free (just with your email) and has a bunch of vides you can flip through.

"Here’s why I’m confident Exit Five will win (and I’m not even being arrogant). 

1. We are bootstrapped and profitable. 

I accidentally started this company. It was a “creator” business first - with my newsletter and podcast in 2019. That was the seed that led to today. Exit Five did $1M in revenue while it was a solo business - which turned out to be the perfect angel investor. I decided to plow the profits into building a team in 2023 so we could build a real company. 

Today we have a full-time team of 6 soon to be 7. Things are growing. But we are in control of our own destiny and can grow at whatever pace I chose as the owner. 

2. We are building a great team. 

The team also gives us optionality here. Anyone who’s spent enough time in business knows that it’s not a platitude - people are the most improtant ingredient. If you get the team right, you can do anything. 

If our business went to 0 overnight - I’m confident we could rebuild something new with our team. I’m also a creator first (since 2014 if you check the receipts) so I like our odds if we ever needed to figure it out. 

3. I don’t give two fucks about the competition. 

Seriously. In all honesty. I like to watch and learn what others are doing - but it does not impact how we move. And that’s because point number one and two here - we are in control of our destiny, and I’m bullish on our ability to figure things about. 

But also because it’s not a zero sum game! I see it all the time. People can have multiple memberships to things. I have two gym memberships. I know Exit Five members that have other memberships to professional development groups and communities. 

There is so much freedom in knowing it’s not zero sum. We don’t need to dominate a market. I don’t need to create a new category. Everyone can win and we will too. 

4. We just unlocked something massive over the last year. We are not in the marketing education space. 

Nope. 

We are in the people business. 

We need to have marketing content and education - that is what will bring people in. But we are not out there touting our marketing expertise as being the best or the smartest. So dunk on our marketing takes all you want. 

We are in the business of connecting people who *work in maeketing* and that is the secret sauce. 

We also have thousands of people from around the world who want to share their marketing experience with our community because we have the reach and can amplify their voice in a way they don’t have by writing on their company blog. So we can teach through those experts - and spend our time focused on the people. 

Making IRL (and real online) connections possible - more important than ever today because of AI, slop, and fakes.

"FOLLOW FRIDAY - you remember that? From the early days of Twitter.

I'm bringing it back. I just decided.

Some people for you to follow:

1. Allison Saxon - she runs events on our team at Exit Five; she is responsible for Drive, Marketing Leadership Retreat, and all of our workshops, meet-ups and dinners around the U.S. this year.

2. Anthony Blatner - he runs Speedwork, a LinkedIn Ads agency. We met through Exit Five, and Anthony and his team have been running our LinkedIn ads for the last year and we have seen insane results through the combination of organic + Thought Leader ads.

3. Ding Zheng - he runs Eventshark, a great video production company for B2B. We became friends through work and our love of music and fitness. Now he's texting me from China sending verses at 3 AM or giving me a random idea. Good people, and since 2024 he's become so much more than ""the sales rapper.""

4. Jess Cook - recently promoted to VP of Marketing at Vector, OG Exit Five member, and we had a great podcast session yesterday. I got to ask Jess about how they are doing influencer marketing, the ROI of having a podcast at work, and her path from content marketer to VP Marketing. Plus some talk about kids and work and managing it all.

5. Louis Grenier - cancer survivor and marketing genius; reminded me why I love marketing in the first place this week after recording a podcast on how to stand out. And yes, you can even stand out in B2B.

6. Erik Jacobson - founder of Hatch (video/podcast production company), and has been my podcast partner for the last ... five years maybe? Yes podcasting ""works"" yes even in B2B yes you don't need a huge audience to feel something from this. This guy has given me so much wisdom on strategy here, and his company has helped run my podcast for years and i would have quit three times without them. Also just a good person, which means the world.

While I'm running my MULTIPLE SEVEN FIGURE BUSINESS, from my home office, in Vermont, USA.

And I really hope this makes it onto the LinkedIn Lunatics sub Reddit (which is also good for LLM discovery and AEO I've heard, so maybe worth it for the Exit Five search increase).

I wrote this post last night and scheduled it for early this morning so there’s no turning back now.

"Random Sunday LinkedIn bullets:

• I love when people shit on LinkedIn. This app has made me more connections than X or IG or YouTube or Facebook. Meaningful connections. Candidates. Partners. Friends. It’s influenced millions in revenue. I love when people dunk on LinkedIn. 

• The worst feature ever created on this app is the “Congrats on your work anniversary feature” I have 52 DMs right now for my two year anniversary as an investor with GTM fund, so I’ll miss any meaningful DMs. 

• I believe in the power of speaking things into existence. Your mind is an incredible tool and you can will yourself into and out of almost anything. I’m working to pass this onto my children. I tell them how great they are. How smart they are. How capable they are. They will carry this with them forever. They will know Dad was supportive and their biggest fan. I don’t care if you think it makes me soft. 

• You are nothing without discipline. What do you do when no one is watching? Are you getting up early? Working out? Everyone will make excuses. Few will make it a way of life. 30 minutes a day can change the quality of your life - your mood, your energy, your creativity, your stress. Why would you not make the time for that? 

• B2B marketing is not boring. That’s just a fun clickbait line we like to use to dunk on each other here. I don’t see how selling yet another seltzer online or hoodies is somehow “cooler” than B2B. We’ve met thousands of entrepreneurs and companies through Exit Five doing legitimately interesting things in B2B. So stop the B2B is not boring stuff. 

• One of the hardest parts about being a leader is having to sometimes sit back and let others shit on you online because you can’t tell the truth - because it does me no good to expose someone else online, so I just have to sit there and let some guy roast me for something. Or some other guy tell people I’m an asshole - yet we’ve never met! The best thing to happen to E5 in the last 2 years is in person because I get to look people in the eye, shake hands, and be real people in person. Everyone is smarter than you and better than you on the internet :) 

• I think most companies are stuck using marketing as defense. When the right way to deploy marketing is as OFFENSE. The Founder / CEO must care deeply about marketing because marketing is sales if you really understand it that way. Use marketing to play offense not defense. And sometimes the best marketing plays are not crazy - sometimes it’s quiet literally going to the side of the street that is not as crowded and selling your product over there. 

• Copywritijg is Still to this day the number one marketing skill that has paid off the most for me. Communication is the most important skill in business, especially with all the AI SLOP SLOP

"Great marketers know how to take inspiration from everywhere. They are curious. Creative. Scrappy. They don't need ""B2B marketing examples"" to understand what might work in a B2B context.

I think one of the best parts of the job is marketing is that the ingredients are almost always different. Open the fridge and you've got to make a meal with three eggs, half a bagel, and an onion. But then at another company, the fridge is stocked full with fresh produce, grass fed beef, and a freshly tapped keg of kombucha (or something like that).

At each company the ingredients are different. Some companies are well funded. Some have no funding. Some companies have proven CEOs. Some have first-time CEOs. Sometimes you can attract Tier 1 talent (ex: Anthropic right now) and sometimes you can't because of the things i wrote before this; you might have to figure out how to start with Tier 3 talent and make it work. Some companies are in super regulated industries. Some have fewer rules.

But this is what's FUN. There is no formula. It's always different. Channels that worked for one company don't work for another.

This is the craft of marketing.

"We've been running a super secret group for CMOs / VP Marketing doing $10M+ ARR

Started building it out in the spring and we launched the first group over the summer; we have a group of CMOs and marketing leaders doing $10M - $100M+ in revenue.

A CMO friend of mine reached out and wanted something more than the current Exit Five membership; she wanted a group of peers - a truly private place to share, connect, get unstuck.

• Every member signs an NDA to keep things private (so you can feel comfortable sharing org charts, budgets, venting about the CEO)

• You give us a list of 1-2 direct competitors that you do not want to be a member in the group, so you don't have to worry about any spies

• We have proven we can build an amazing community; we'll continue to do that - but now we're carving out a space top CMOs specifically, and the early results have been amazing. I keep asking Matt and Dan why we didn't start this earlier.

A bunch of top CMOs you know already in there. We put you in a group to start so you can quickly meet a bunch of people; we have a few proven formats for calls that you'll actually want to join.

Then you have a private space (Slack) to share ideas, post questions, get feedback. We've already built out a directory of tools, agencies, vendors that our top CMOs are using. Members are meeting on their own to discuss PLG strategy, how to re-design their bloated org chat, and how to set expectations with the board about AI.

I'm super bullish about this smaller group for Exit Five CMOs, and decided to break the plan internally and make a video about it this morning after I dropped my kids off at school.

Warning: this is not for everyone

But we have something for everyone beyond this:

If this is not a fit for you there's our free newsletter, monthly live sessions, podcast, and Exit Five Pro membership you can explore (all up on our website).

"Wrapping up the last few days of 2025.

I love my job; I love our company. And I'm also excited to chill out for bit and come back ready to go again in January. Both things can be true!

Some notes:

➡️ We doubled in revenue again this year; third year in a row we have doubled. Double-double-double. Not bad.

➡️ Added three new teammates. It's almost always a ""Who not Now"" problem now. People continue to be the most important thing to get right.

➡️ Got on a bunch of flights; did events in five major cities. Totally worth it. In-person is much different than online in the best way. Also gives me hope for humanity. We are better to each other in-person.

➡️ Big sigh. Made a bunch of mistakes of course. Wasted time and money. Burnt some social capital. Hurt some feelings. Inevitable. But still sucks. I tell myself that nothing bothers me but of course that's a lie. And I know there will only be more of it if the growth curve of success continues to accelerate. Also: business is just hard. You're doing business with people. People are complicated. So it's hard to chalk it up to ""it's just business.""

➡️ Much more positive note: realized that community is an incredible moat right now. Super bullish on the future with Exit Five and professional networks/community businesses. Feel very fortunate to be in the business we're in right now. Also the brand name, awareness, and recognition shift over the last year has been real. It feels different. In the best way.

➡️ Still bootstrapped, no outside funding, and profitable. And just went double-double-double. Who's mad at that?

All around just having a good time too; was saying to Dan (E5 CEO) the other night on the phone -- I never got my MBA. But the amount we're learning about business through building Exit Five has been a completely unexpected benefit.  The fact that we get to make money from the business is a bonus.

OK that's not completely true; I don't have a trust fund unfortunately so I *do* need to make money through work. But my point is that we are learning so much beyond what we knew about marketing and it's super rewarding.",177.0,52.0,0.0,229.0,0.88,Experimenter,GTM/Sales,Personal Experience,Observation/Opinion,Text-only,Wrapping up the last few days of 2025.,"Wrapping up the last few days of 2025.

"THOUGHT LEADER DOWN

Breaking News

Exit Five Founder & CEO Dave Gerhardt hits the injured list for the next 8-12 weeks after successful surgery to fix femoroacetabular impingement and labral tear in his right hip.

Despite the pain he is currently in, Gerhardt - an eternal optimist - remains positive given the extreme privilege of his situation.

""My job requires sending Slack messages, posting on LinkedIn, and taking phone calls. I'm very lucky. I will get through this and I'm looking forward to the mental challenge of recovery.""

In an interview with Forbes, Gerhardt also comment that he would have been ""absolutely fucked"" if he stuck to his ways as a solopreneur. 

Now with a full-time team of 7 people working on Exit Five, Gerhardt will be able to recover in peace while his business continues to grow and he can stick to writing witty comments on LinkedIn and giving feedback in Slack over the next few months.

""Before you know it, I will be back running, lifting, rucking, cross country skiing, and doing all the necessary things I need to do to calm my inner thoughts and demons, but for now this is mostly going to be a battle of me vs. myself.""

Please do not send any flowers or edible arrangements. 

Instead, tell as many people that work in marketing as possible about the amazing company that is known as Exit Five and make sure to join the email list on the website.

Note: I don't want your sympathy, I am fine and very lucky. I just knew this is the perfect type of thing to post on LinkedIn and it will help grow our business.

We will 100% turn this into a Thought Leader ad too.

"Made a ton of changes to Exit Five last 365 days: 

1. More in person stuff. Big events. Medium events. Dinners. Hikes. Rage rooms. 30+ small events happening this year, available to members in different cities. 

2. Local chapters. Related to number one. Now have members in a dozen places leading other members online and offline. Amazing way to scale this community in a meaningful way. We didn’t invent local chapters - but we damn sure are using them. 

3. Marketing is more then SaaS. That was my background, so lot of early stuff skewed toward SaaS. Today we see the world is MARKETING. And some people work in SaaS. Just like some work in hardware. We now have industry specific groups and discussions that go well beyond SaaS. 

4. Matchmaking. Many people join to build a network. We help by connecting members 1:1 each month to help build their peer group. 

5. Roundtables / therapy sessions / all kinds of training - videos and live sessions available to anyone with a membership. 

6. AI trained on all of our stuff to help get you better answers and be a thought partner if you need it. Different than ChatGPT. 

7. A real team of six full time humans that care A LOT about delivering value and helping the people that work in marketing do better work and make connections.

I see it as this: 

We are not in the marketing hot takes business. We are in the people business. 
We can help you meet peers, get inspired, get unstuck, maybe even make some work friends. 

There are other communities and platforms you can join too - it doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. 

I’m not competing with anyone. And you should start a rival community if you think you can do better; let the market decide. Also I know today even a bunch of our members have multiple memberships to things. 

But we’ve been going now for three years, built on 15 years of my own personal experience and receipts - and I don’t plan on slowing down soon. 

We have product market fit + a team that gives a shit — and that’s an amazing tailwind to have.

On the heels of 88 NPS and 77 NPS in the first two years, back for a third year in a row in VERMONT this time in Stowe. September 2026. The best event out there for B2B marketers (according to me). 

Join me and the Exit Five team + hundreds of people who: 

- Work in B2B marketing like you do
- But are also cool people in real life like you are too - with hobbies, interests, families (imagine that!)

The whole thing is: come to learn about marketing and sharpen your skills (we think marketing is a craft) but stay because the people are fun to hang out with too, and we need a bit more connection in real life.

It's going to be great. We continue to put more into this event every year and it will continue to pay off.

"Content marketers run modern marketing.

Because almost all marketing today is shaped online.

And online marketing shows up as:

- Ads
- Videos
- Articles
- Podcasts and clips like this with Jess Cook
- Social posts
- Newsletters
- Communities
- Influencers

Different formats. But none of it works without a clear content strategy and strong content marketing.

Jess is a great example of this: she started her career as a copywriter for big CPG brands. She cut her teeth writing 200+ variations of a recipe for Rice Krispie Treats.

Then built a career in content marketing: content market manager, director, VP brand and content.

Then turned that into a Head of Marketing role at a startup and was recently promoted to VP on the heels of her success using - wait for it - content to drive revenue.

Not because Vector's content gets a lot of impressions and their podcast is unique or because their little mascot is cute.

But because it's working! Those things are driving revenue. 

I had a conversation with Jess last week (now out on my podcast) and she shared three key marketing plays that she's run over the past year:

1. Influencer Marketing - how does it work in B2B, how did she find influencers, what did it cost, how much pipeline was generated, how did they measure it

2. Podcasting - why they started a podcast, how their podcast stands out, how they record, when/where, how they prep, how they know it's working

3. LinkedIn - we talk a bit about what content types (and strategy) is working well here today

4. Career Path - her path from content to VP Marketing

"We run a private community for B2B CMOs doing $25M+ in annual revenue (and many well past that, including members from companies that will do $800 and $1B in revenue this year).

Because ""who's in the room"" is the entire value prop, and we've taken everything we've learned from three years building Exit Five to bring this together.

VPs and CMOs at this level need a peer group; a place to turn outside of work where you can ask questions about everything: 

• Compensation - what should you be making at this level?
• Equity (""Hey I'm 4 years in, what is my equity worth? anyone go through an exit or sell secondaries?""
• Internal relationships like working with the CEO; or how the CMO and CPO should work together
• Honest recommendations about vendors and agencies (""do not spend $100k on this vendor, trust me it's a cluster fck)
• Gut checks for all the things that come up at work that you don't have a friend to text and ask about (""I am battling with my CFO on this, am I crazy or is he?"")
• Or even just ""Hey what are you getting your team for a holiday gift this year?""

Each month we run calls designed around a topic that matters right now (ex: last month there was a breakout group around Org Design; then one on Budgeting for 2026) - but it's not me or Matt or the Exit Five team talking; it's the VPs and CMOs. Sharing what you are doing, where you need help.

We are simply the hosts of the party and the facilitators, but that's our secret sauce. Pulling together the right people in the right room - and knowing what B2B marketing leaders care about.

We're like the friend that you want to give the Aux cord too.

One of the best parts about running Exit Five is that each week I get to chat with a top CMO in B2B, and this week my guest is Maura Rivera from Qualified.

In a world where CMOs are changing jobs every 1-2 years, Maura has been holding it down at Qualified for SIX YEARS. That deserves some type of award, and is worth unpacking (plus she told me something like half of the marketing team has been there that long too, which says a lot).

We talked about:

• Why product launches are the glue for marketing (and why you need to have this cadence of product launches and a tight relationship with the VP Product)

•  What agentic marketing really means for the future of marketing, how is it different than ""marketing"" and why outbound is actually working for them right now (I thought outbound is dead?)

• How events have become a huge part of their strategy. Plus, plenty of good banter along the way. This was a fun one. I want to go hangout with Maura now.

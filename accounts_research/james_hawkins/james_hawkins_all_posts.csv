Afterwards, I was walking back to my hotel when suddenly, out of the gloomy darkness, probably 100 yards behind me, I heard “JAAAAMES”. |  | If you’ve ever walked along Mission late at night, this meant I was either about to get assaulted, or a high five.

Most content feels AI-generated.
Most of it feels recycled.
And a lot of it reads like it was written by someone who has not touched real code in years.
 
So when something actually teaches me something, I notice.
 
A few weeks ago, I opened an article a friend sent me.
No context.
Just a link and a message: ""Read this. Trust me.""
 
It was a PostHog deep dive on the first year of building with AI agents.
 
I expected another surface-level summary.
 
Instead, I found myself slowing down.
Reading lines twice.
Thinking about problems I had normalized, but never actually questioned.
 
There was a chart in the piece that stuck with me, a simple visual showing where agents break after long-run scenarios.
The kind of visual that makes you say,
""Ah. Okay. That’s why my last experiment behaved like that.""
 
A few days later, someone else sent me another piece - this one breaking down common AI coding mistakes.
They screenshotted a small section about engineers over-trusting model output without grounding it in system behaviour.
 
That one hit a nerve.
Because I had just done the exact same thing the week before.
 
That is when it clicked for me.
  
PostHog is writing the kind of content that feels like it was created by people who are actually in the mess with us, not outside of it.
 
It is calm.
It is grounded.
And it makes you rethink your assumptions without trying to impress you.

"Just onboarded and set up PostHog analytics in 8 minutes. An AI agent did the whole thing.

I literally just told it to add analytics to my Next.js app and watched it:

→ Read my entire codebase to understand the structure
→Auto-instrument 12 tracking points (forms, CTAs, navigation, errors)
→Set up client/server architecture and reverse proxy
→Wire up environment variables (added them to Vercel too!)
→Install dev tools for my editor

No docs. No googling. No ChatGPT.

Remember setting up Google Analytics in 2015?

You'd spend half a day adding script tags, manually creating events for every button click, debugging why half your tracking wasn't firing. Then do it all again when the design changed.

This isn't even about analytics. It's that a PM can now ship production-grade instrumentation without a ticket. A non-technical founder can implement features that needed a senior dev last year.

The gap between ""I need this"" and ""it's live"" is disappearing. This is the baseline now. Every integration, every setup, every ""technical"" thing is about to work like this.

Wild how fast things have moved.

"What's new in AI pricing: giving up on the idea of value-based pricing?

PostHog just announced new AI pricing that's disruptive in a way that might upset pricing experts. They're not trying to tie pricing to outcomes. They're not charging based on seats. 

The model is simple: it's a pass-through of AI costs w/ a 20% markup. And every customers gets $20 of free usage to try it out.

What's to like about this model: (a) it gives everyone access to AI features & lets them choose how they want to use them, (b) it feels fair -- it's pretty hard to argue w/ or negotiate against the model, and (c) it positions PostHog's value as *elsewhere* -- they have 10 other products they can monetize & AI can be used across all of them.

I see this as a step toward a potential future direction* that might look something like this:

1. Customers choose between self-managed/BYO LLM and managed AI.

Many folks are probably sitting on millions of $$ of unused AI tokens from OpenAI and Anthropic. Meanwhile they're getting overage bills from AI vendors in coding & other categories. 

Enterprises would (IMO) love to easily plug their unused credits into their favorite 3rd party tools. It would mean fewer AI vendors to manage, fewer tokens to predict & way less waste.

The margins on managed AI would likely come down substantially (similar to PostHog's 20% markup) since this would be ""competing"" with BYO.

2. Vendors would monetize elsewhere, likely in more predictable subscription/SaaS models (although PostHog's products are all usage-based).

This fits into how enterprise buyers traditionally like to pay for technology. And it forces vendors to clarify their value-add above & beyond the AI tokens (no room for AI wrappers).

3. This would open the door for 3rd party products to be sold *through* OpenAI & Anthropic, similar to the AWS marketplace model.

If 3rd party products help sell more OpenAI tokens, why wouldn't you give OpenAI sellers quota relief on these products? And why wouldn't Google & Anthropic follow suit? 

Anecdotally, selling via the AWS marketplace can result in 60%+ faster procurement cycles. This could be win-win for the LLMs & the app vendors. 

---

What's exciting about this direction is that it would *simplify* buying, accelerate AI adoption & align incentives across the ecosystem. Although it does feel like we'd be going back-to-the-future. 

*I don't see this model applying to every product. It'll likely apply best to developer-focused tools and/or bigger platforms w/ a lot of AI usage. The folks who would be most insulated would be ""service-as-a-software"" players who deliver tangible work products/outcomes.

Although only a fraction of signups fill it out, it helps us figure out:

- Which creator sponsorships are working?
- Is there creators we should be sponsoring but aren’t?
- How popular is AI search from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.?
- Do events drive signups?
- Is there some channel we should be caring about more?
- How much do referrals matter?
- Where are we spending money but not getting mentioned?

Attribution is often a mirage. UTM parameters might tell you users come from one source, but the reality of where they heard about you is likely different. A user could read a newsletter, search “posthog,” and click a Google Ad. This would tell us “Google Ads are awesome” when maybe that isn't the case.

"Having “simple pricing” is not the flex you think it is.

B2B companies often aim to have fewer tiers, a unified credit system, a single subscription for everything.

They think this is the only way to prevent people from being charged more than they expected, which hurts the customer and them (more churn, worse reputation).

The problem with simplicity is that it limits your ability to charge users for the value they receive.

The alternative we take at PostHog is predictable and transparent pricing. We do this by:

- Creating a transparent and detailed pricing page.
- Giving users a clear view on how much they’ve spent so far and how much they are projected to spend.
- Adding spend limits.
- Help users tune their spend to what they’re actually using.
- Being generous with refunds like our side project insurance that protects customers from bills if their product goes viral.

"One of the most important things you can do when building an AI-powered feature is plan for failure.

This means adding monitoring, error handling, and guardrails, because it will inevitably smash into them.

Here’s what our team at PostHog has found most helpful:

1. Monitor product traces from the beginning. It’s hard to review 100 conversations per day. It’s impossible to review 1,000. Those conversations are real-world user questions and struggles, and provide all the insights you need to build.

2. Be explicit about the data that needs to be set directly. Anything an AI can hallucinate, it will hallucinate. Include rules like “Never hallucinate an API key” and “Never import new packages or libraries that aren't already used.”

3. Add guardrails for people. When people see an empty text box, they get scared and forget everything. The solution? Add suggestions for how they can use your AI-powered features, nudge them in the right direction, and help them remember what’s possible.

"PSA for anyone running a website.

You’ve surely heard how essential Google Analytics is, but GA has a way of making you feel like you need another degree just to decipher it. PostHog doesn’t do that. More data, less brain fog.

A few things I’ve used it for lately:

• Asked it to review my last 100 user sessions and give me a clean breakdown of how people interacted with a new feature.

 • Used its AI tool to pinpoint where users spent the most and least time over the last 30 days.

 • Let it generate complex funnel analysis without me lifting a finger.

 • Watched screen recordings to understand real user behavior in a way no graph can.

Just putting this out there.
If you’re still using Google Analytics, this might spare you a few grey hairs.

"The best tech gift for geeky parents isn't another iPad.

This weekend, my kid and I spent a rainy afternoon vibe-coding with the Deskhog (https://lnkd.in/ezdh--8b) - a tiny computer with a tiny battery and a tiny 3D-printed case created by Danilo Campos at PostHog (disclaimer: founders 🦔 james hawkins and Tim Glaser worked at Arachnys with me). 

We built a weather widget that suggests appropriate clothing. It ALWAYS recommends shorts. Obviously. Even well below freezing.

But at least it created a shared space for a discussion that went something other than:

- Put on the jacket! It's cold.
- No.
- Oh. OK.

So to all the parents out there - if you:

- have passive-aggressive goals you'd like to gamify (violin practice tracker, anyone? Allowance dashboard?)
- know how to use Claude Code
- believe that a small screen with no real internet connectivity/interactivity is better than an iPad
- want to learn a bit of C++ the easy way

This stocking-stuffer is for you.

The constraints are the feature. The tiny screen. The limited connectivity. The focused purpose.

"After weeks of researching how our team at PostHog builds with AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code, I published a deep dive to help you get the most out of them. Here are the things I learned:

1. Treat your big codebase differently than a small codebase. Most AI coding advice is written for vibe coders going from zero to one. You need to care much more about context windows, automation tests, and prompting in larger codebases.

2. Provide the right context, rules, and guardrails. Without them, LLMs go off the rails fast. Reference example code, add documentation, use rules files for different languages, write a spec. And use non-AI tools like linters, type hinting, and testing suites.

3. Learn what AI is good at. Our team finds it excels at autocomplete, adding more tests, rubberducking, and doing research. It’s not so good at writing code in an unfamiliar language, using the correct methods/classes/libraries, following up-to-date best practices, and writing tests from scratch.

4. Always be leveling up your workflow. Great product engineers are always experimenting. To help them do this, we raised our AI tool budget to $300/m, test new tools, try different models, dogfood AI in PostHog itself, and build with AI in hackathons.

Remember that as much as you might dislike AI personally, your competitors are using it and so are your users. In both cases, knowing the capabilities and limits of AI helps.

"If we’ve ever worked together, I’ve probably said to you; you’re the driver.

By that, I mean; have agency, form opinions, take charge, act boldly, change course if necessary, bring people with you.

The phrase is all over PostHog's epic new site. I had the joy of interviewing co-CEO 🦔 james hawkins the other night at Granola. It was a good deep chat about company building; full deep dive in the comments but my six favourite things:

𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐩𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝; 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐮𝐩𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐚𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

“It’s easier to rally people — hires or investors — around bold ideas. Building a supersonic jet becomes easier than accounting software. So raise your ambition” 

𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝

PostHog took off when they switched from non-technical buyers who took meetings but never used the product to direct, critical and committed early users who were just like them. 

𝐑𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭

The company is built on extreme openness including transparent pricing, public roadmaps and one of my favourite off-kilter brands. This authenticity resonated with their technical audience and created a cult-like following; PostHog built 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 this group not for them, and devs were willing to stick with their first cloud product until it improved because they felt ownership in the company’s success.

𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐲 > 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬

PostHog runs on 2–3 person teams with complete decision-making power, no cross-functional meetings by design, and no deadlines. 1:1s got banned. They happily traded polish for velocity.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬

Most companies get their product or website to good enough / 80% done and move on. PostHog obsesses over the final 20%; the part that makes something remarkable rather than just functional. Their operating system website took six months but went viral and converts better. It’s them in a site.

𝐈𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬𝐧’𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦, 𝐢𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐢𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝

Between PostHog going through YC, American spellings on the site and a few other things, I had the impression they're American. But the team made a deliberate choice to position publicly as global from the start. James actually lives in the UK. 

As someone very bored of the “SF is the centre of the world” and “Europe sucks” / “Europe rules” narrative, refreshing to see some pragmatism. 

Finally; James on building companies in YOUR way:

"I needed to buy a product analytics tool for my 100-person team.

I started with the market leader 🔵. They had a freemium version, so I signed up and began exploring.

The docs weren't helping, so I reached out for support.

A sales rep quickly booked a call with me. But instead of helping, he immediately started qualifying me: team size, budget, timeline.

I spent half the call answering his questions just to get basic setup help.

After all that, he wouldn't share real pricing. Just gave me some vague ""starts at"" number that told me nothing about actual costs.

Then he said I couldn't get technical support without signing a contract first.

I told him I wouldn't sign anything without testing if the product actually worked for our use case.

His response? ""Can't help you.""

So I tried PostHog. Same self-service signup, but when I hit an issue and reached out, their customer success person solved my problem immediately.

They talked transparently about pricing and how it scales with usage.

We became PostHog 🔴 customers that day. Two years later, we're still with them.

I've recommended PostHog multiple times since then.

No referral fees, just genuine gratitude.

That other tool didn't just lose one customer. They probably lost ten by now.

He simply sends a deck, gets on a one-hour Zoom, answers questions, sends materials, and then never follows up.

This strategy delivers a 75%+ conversion rate across 100+ conversations.

Today, Salil manages 300 LPs by himself by issuing quarterly letters of 5-15 pages that provide full context for every markdown, down round, and value decrease.

This eliminates LP anxiety and reduces the need for catch-up calls, letting him spend 70% of his time on founders instead of investor relations. 

With more time for actual investing, he built his unconventional portfolio approach:

Instead of fighting for 20% ownership stakes, Salil invests smaller checks of a couple $M each in 4x the number of companies, quadrupling his probability of capturing a decacorn.

He builds positions over 3-4 rounds: say $2M at $25-50M post, then $3-4M at $100M post, then $3-4M at $250M post.

This gets $10-20M invested at a blended $100-150M entry cost, delivering 40-60x returns at $10B valuations despite never owning 20% at any single round.

He also has a true market-based partnership model, where he presents deals to 5+ domain experts at competing firms who invest only when the deals genuinely make sense, thereby eliminating politics and social obligation of traditional VC partnerships within the same firm.

This delivers pure market signals with a 30% opt-in rate among investors.

What surprised me most was Salil's operational efficiency, without even an EA. 

He outsources everything non-core, like fund administration, legal, and accounting (spends millions to buy back mental space). 

The freed-up bandwidth allows him to focus purely on technical evaluation.

Salil's model works because of his established track record, narrow focus, and comfort operating against consensus when others pass on deals he still believes in.

Salil’s systems to manage 300 LPs and evaluate 200+ deals annually are learnable. I broke down his entire operating model and his unique strategy that generates 6x TVPI with 35% IRRs returns in my latest deep dive.

YES!!! We recently switched both DYP.AI and Packative from Amplitude to PostHog, and thanks to that I’m excited to cut down tool overload and speed up page performance.

"Happy quarterly planning season for those who celebrate. To help make this as successful as possible, here’s some important mistakes to avoid:

1. Thinking you need a perfect plan: 🦔 Charles C. dropped some wisdom when he said “all objectives are bad – they have many compromises, are fallible, easy to game, or may be affected by external factors, so use the least bad ones.”

2. Not preparing asynchronously: Meetings go off the rails when people having done no prep or “thinking” beforehand.

3. Obsessing over metrics: PostHog once required OKRs, but quickly realized that after doing so, engineers would go figure out what to build. This plan matters much more, so write that down instead.

4. Too many, complicated, misaligned, or impossible to measure goals: Focus on what you’re going to ship and call out the areas you don’t want to work on.

5. Ignoring your plan after writing it: Quarterly planning is only as useful as the progress you make on it. If you're not checking in on your progress, you can't know if you'll be successful.

“It felt like someone was finally trying to build the kind of company I’d aspire to build myself.”

“The thing is, when you’re building a startup, you’re always building two things: the product, and the organisation.”

“PostHog is default-alive although we’re hiring and scaling aggressively. ARR is growing steadily every month. When I had my interview with James, he pulled up the revenue growth chart right there. That level of trust struck me.”

“Fun isn’t necessary to build a business, but if you want to build a huge business, it probably is.”

“Look at landing pages like posthug.com, the merch shop, all the pineapple on pizza jokes.” 🍍+🍕=🦔

4 weeks ago – I couldn't stop myself from writing. Today – my blog post is the latest edition of one of my favorite newsletters, Product for Engineers (only a bit biased!) Link in the comments below. But how it happened is its own story. It all started with a debate.

A LIVELY debate in our PostHog Slack. ""Do we need more platform-type teams in engineering?"" On our philosophy: alignment. ABCU – Always Be Close… to Users. On the concrete steps: friction. ""Can platform work be close to users? But isn't it also must-have for a great product?"" Scaling to 100 engineers means challenges, but there was something else happening.

The real source of confusion: one term with two meanings. ""Platform"". One side focused on the positive, the other on the negative. We just didn't have a name for the mismatch.

It only felt right to give it a name, and a thesis. This isn't just PostHog, it's so many product-focused scale-ups.

A couple evenings of writing. A couple more redacting after feedback from writers I respect (thx Yakko M.!). Then, ""Merge"" in my personal blog repo, and straight into Slack it went.

My first week at PostHog has been nothing short of amazing.
I was lucky in the sense that, while onboarding, some of the #productengineering teams had an offsite which enabled me to not only meet my own team and ‘manager’, but also meet the people I will be hiring for/with.

#PostHog is not joking when they say they move fast and have high expectations. I’ve already interviewed candidates & shadowed my peers, worked on ‘what’s next’, and dove into the pipeline.
However….. all that without feeling overwhelmed!!
Of course there is still enough to learn and discover, Heck… I just started!
but I learn by doing and they respected that.

It’s the culture of trust that makes this possible. The people I met are extremely welcoming, transparent, kind, and genuinly intelligent (IQ and EQ).

"The love we get for our marketing at PostHog makes me so proud 🤗 

In an effort to help more people create marketing developers love, I wrote 40 things we’ve learned about marketing for developers. 

Some highlights include:

- Developers build things because what exists isn't good enough. Tell people that! Be opinionated, unhappy with the status quo, and take a stand. Don't follow the crowd or dilute your message with a bunch of corporate speak.

- Assume your audience is smart. Don't try to trick them with tedious, clickbaity, hyperbolic marketing tactics. It's patronizing. Make honest claims about the functionality of your product. Don't unfairly or make false claims about competitors.

- Think of the biggest reasons that would stop someone from using your product and address those with your marketing. Early at PostHog, these were people doubting whether the team was strong and if the product would exist. Our public handbook was our solution to this.

- Identify what you want to be great at and spend your time there. List the areas you don't want to spend time on too, otherwise you will be distracted by a bunch of random opportunities and never go into the depth you need to succeed in one channel.

- AI platforms like ChatGPT seem to be more influential than Google already. We've seen a 41x increase in visitors from AI platforms in the last 12 months as well as a 15x increase in them being mentioned on signup since November.

- HackerNews is a double-edged sword. Although a lot of people see it as the ultimate success for marketing and it provides a huge ego-boost, the actual signup boost you get from it is much lower. It's also unreliable, even if you're great, you'll have a 1 in 10 hit rate (and don't try to game it).

"I’m joining PostHog as a Product Engineer 🦔
The past 8 months building Clientpulse.ai have been intense…

We launched the MVP, shipped multiple iterations, and built a foundation for analyzing user feedback. But we didn’t reach PMF. 

I bootstrapped it, planning to raise after some traction. But I failed to get there. 
My cofounder couldn’t continue without funding, and I had to choose: keep grinding solo in ramen mode, or join another team building something great. I chose the second path.

Clientpulse will stay live with basic support for current users. I’m considering open-sourcing the LLM-based clustering we built later on. 
I believe it could help the community analyze large datasets more accurately than reasoning models do today.

Why PostHog?
The product and the culture are awesome! I used PostHog a lot and even helped other startups integrate it.
In my opinion, it’s the best value for money compared to any other analytics tool out there.

P.S.
If you’re using PostHog and have feedback, feel free to DM me. Product Engineers talk to users here!",161,24,2,,,Teacher,Startup/Founder,Insight/Observation,Statement → Commentary,Text-only,I’m joining PostHog as a Product Engineer 🦔,"I’m joining PostHog as a Product Engineer 🦔

"My job is now 95% Claude Code and like 10 APIs and in Jan I’ll show you how I do it all… here’s what I’m up to…

I’ve not been posting, because December is a time for building.

And boy, I’ve built a lot. Here’s what’s coming from me in Jan.

1. A new Claygent course that builds Claygents for you, validates them, and fixes errors.

2. A playbook builder that comes up with GTMe ideas for you!

3. A bunch of Claude Code skills (copywriting, data, skeptical buyer, and of course a Clay skill that auto-updates.

And I am working on AutoGTMe, a product just for good ole Jordan. It does most of the things I use in Clay, but it runs in the cloud, it makes agentic decisions about which tools to run, and I can run it from my phone.

I’m trying to grow in 2026 by doing more work now on tools and systems so I can work from my phone.

What I’m selling these days is not tools, it’s not even education, it’s the ability for you to take a process and have code replicate it with high accuracy.

"I'm on the edge and I just can't take it anymore...



Since 2020, I've been focused on building at the bleeding edge of AI and GTM as the OG GTM Engineer...

Most of that work has been speaking to other in-the-trenches practitioners, not worrying about leaving folks behind.

Today, I'm so happy to announce that Topline Media to the world... a chance to bring some of my ideas to GTM leaders around the world and not just to those on the bleeding edge.

Some stats from the team:
1. Today it takes 8000 attempts to get 1 real customer meeting.
2. It takes dozens of meetings to close a deal.
3. And then 40 months of revenue to break even on that deal.

We need actual practices to get out of this steep decline... a media outlet that is about documenting building, not talking heads.

I'd suggest you subscribe as my goal specifically when I contribute is to translate what is happening at the bleeding edge actually building workflows (Claude Code, APIs, data workflows, PVPs, PQS, my love of vertical SaaS and why) to folks who want to experiment there.

So you'll see me talk about topics like...
1. Why ICP and TAM scoring lead you way astray, and what to do instead
2. The horizontal SaaS company thought trap, and how to escape
3. The exact steps to build a useful GTM engine from absolute 0

"Today I am pardoning all you turkeys that say Clay is expensive… 

Here’s how to NEVER PAY more than $800/mo for Clay.

First off an enterprise yearly subscription to Clay with CRM integration is under $9k/year and your cost is 1.5 pennies or $0.015 per credit.

This means you can enrich 600,000 companies (1 clay credit), profiles (1 clay credit), or use a great AI search model like 4o mini for you guessed it… 1 Clay credit. And they are good all year if you pay yearly, so you don’t lose Clay credits.

Not to mention formulas (free and an amazing hack), live domain checker (free), job changer signal that only charges for results not checks (so cheap).

Okay, but Jordan, what about those things that cost 20 or 40 or 100 Clay credits… we are spending so much.

Well this is called a convenience tax… where your sheer laziness costs you. 

This last week I paid like $300 for an eye exam when an in-network provider would have been $0… but it’s just because I didn’t want to like go figure out my Byzantine eye insurance.

I paid a dumb convenience tax, but I’m not blaming the ophthalmologist, I chose to do this.

Enter Clay’s API BYK program and HTTP API integration. 

The Bring Your Key API program lets you pay clay ZERO EXTRA DOLLARS and just enter in your own API key and Clay EATS THE pass through costs. 

So scraping a webpage becomes so cheap (less than 1/10th of a penny) with Zenrows. 

Or use Claygent with your own OpenAI API key and only pay for tokens, Clay gives you the scraping ON THEM.

Clay is making money hand over fist NOT because they are trying to rake people over the coals, but because no one wants to take the 1-2 hours to configure their account to save so so so much money.

So use Clay credits like points (e.g. job changers is where you get SO MUCH for your buck because you aren’t charged for searches just results) and don’t use Clay for mobile phone enrichment as a direct API key will work best.

Stop complaining, there’s no other tool that makes it easy to NOT pay them.

You’re just committed to spending as a way to not understand what you’re buying.

And, sadly, you’re doing a great job burying your head and opening up your wallet needlessly.

"Today I am ??finishing?? my AutoClaygent tool for Clay AI Agents... so you never have to click in Clay again to get GREAT AI agents...

This will be part of my next course... this course will be MUCH more tool based... here's what this tool will do...

One of the things I found myself doing a LOT in clay is copying and pasting, and I was sick and tired of being a copy and paste monkey.

What I wanted was this exact process (which DOESN'T need to involve me)...

1. Interview customer as to what they want (this is me)
2. Have customer act as the AI agent and do the work manually for 50 rows
3. Capture their process + NAMED categories (e.g. how they classify things)
4. Turn it into an AI agent 
5. Have that agent judged by their context.
6. Have AI evaluate #5 and rewrite #4.

The course will be $499 I have decided and it will replace Agent 7 (which is STILL useful and STILL good, there's just a way to do it automatically).

I loved the price of Agent 7 at $299 and my other course on PVP and PQS is a seminal work at $999. But both sold about $100k each, so I want to both price maximize WHILE having more people experience my work.

You will also be required to have a $100/mo Claude Code subscription (it's just that good). So I'll be clear about that, too. You -MIGHT- need the $200/mo thing, but I don't think so.

"If you don’t enjoy your job, and you’re reading this, there IS a WAY out.

This is my favorite book, the Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts.

I want to be tactical, though, you can create your own luck. You can navigate out of your situation.

But to do so requires some advice from the Shawshank Redemption:

Pressure Over Time

Optionality is built in years and months, not days and weeks.

The best optionality is built by becoming an expert, and it’s usually by combining two things (in my case, customer empathy and data w/ AI). I’m the best in the world ONLY when you mix those three things. This is a Ben Horowitz concept, and it’s beautiful.

But the way in which you can get everything that you wanted is to find out what you enjoy doing, and just begin.

Begin by working on it, talking to people about it, building little prototypes, working for people or companies for free to learn it. 

When you do that, you subtly convince the other people that love what you love that you’re in it for passion. 

This is the single thing that people want to hire for, a hunger for the work itself. For its own sake.

Weather it’s gardening, or dental hygiene, or making hats, or ice skating… I promise you there are others out there that feel the way you feel.

Then, once you know them, and once they know your only agenda is to find joy in what you do… they FIND ways to help you. Because they see the joy, they likely feel the joy, and they want other people to feel the joy.

The people I completely avoid building relationships with are those that are money driven, not because it’s bad (I love money), but just because it’s the outcome they seek not the process they love.

That only gets you so far, because you lose your purpose when you make enough money. All that money ever got me, besides freedom from 9-5, is a ridiculously over priced coffee grinder. 

Start working on the side, finding your community, doing the things you feel drawn to… and when you do, you’ll draw in others.

And one day you’ll wake up, and you’ll have so much optionality you won’t know how to chose.

That’s when you really become free, when you get to define your days around your joy, not your job.

Invest daily now, and I promise it will compound over enough time.",79.0,11.0,0,90.0,1.49,Teacher,GTM/Sales,Framework/How-To,Story,Text-only,"If you don’t enjoy your job, and you’re reading this, there IS a WAY out.","If you don’t enjoy your job, and you’re reading this, there IS a WAY out.

"HIRE MAX AS YOUR GTM ENGINEER... here's why you want candidates like MAX...

First off, I don't know Max, but let me tell you why someone like Max is the type of person you want:

1. He started with a framework (in this case, my PVP)
2. He took an actual brand and built with modern tools
3. He was focused on the outcome for the END user
4. He may not be the fastest yet, but clearly he's dogged

Building without frameworks is a recipe for disaster.

Here's where I'd improve what Max did
1. Why is THIS PVP relevant for this brand? Is it?

2. Great messages are built on a foundation of data, but also need to be humanized, I don't talk about this enough, but a good PVP is written from a place of confidence and translates your work from the code to value to the customer

3. Talk more about the connection between the theory and the campaign.

"I have stopped an experiment that gave people a ton of value before a sale, and here's why...

So it's VERY fast for me to build a PVP or PQS list, like 30 mins -> 1 hr. 

Now this list isn't like ALWAYS production ready, but it's usually good enough for a test. So I tried just giving these things to prospects after a first call, in addition to my standard vibe coded proposal.

This was A TERRIBLE idea and probably lost me over $120k, and here's why...

People actually don't want to buy results... and hear me out.

Results are ephemeral, this is why every lead generation agency is always on the razor's edge. When I ran a lead gen agency, people said, ""sure this year I made $2M in closed/won deals and paid you $120k, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME THIS MONTH.""

This isn't true with Google or Facebook, because they have a monopoly and you have no choice, so they can enforce rules (you pay for clicks).

People would take these lists, sometimes even execute on them, and then I suspect they didn't get good results and said, ""THAT GUY SUCKS!""

This reaction is totally normal.

What people really want to buy (from me) is organizational change, they want to be able to do what I do. And I want that, too. I sort of design myself to be fired (I'm working on what a longer term engagement looks like).

Most lists fail, and that's okay, the real change that people need is to be able to launch 1 campaign every week, hopefully every few days. 

Taking a single list, that's 100% vibe coded, and thinking this represents the value was a bad idea because there's invariably a problem that neither of us could have forecasted.

The value was in the process to do it in an hour, not the output of any one hour.

"In just ONE HOUR I did this, with only my voice…  this what GTM Engineering looks like in the future…

100% in Claude Code and with Apify! 

What We Did: Review Enrichment & Classification Pipeline

We built a scalable pipeline to pull and analyze Google Maps reviews for 9,732 ********* practices—every company with 150+ reviews plus all PLATINUM/GOLD tier prospects. Using Apify's Google Maps Reviews Scraper at Scale tier (128 concurrent actors), we collected 201,556 unique reviews across 9,423 locations in under 2 hours. 

Each review was then processed through Claude's Message Batches API for pain signal classification, categorizing reviews into six operational buckets: scheduling issues, communication problems, billing complaints, staff issues, legacy technology mentions, and growth constraints.

 The classification results revealed that detectable pain signals are sparse: only ~1.8% of the 161,379 processed reviews contained identifiable operational complaints (2,787 communication issues, 1,981 billing mentions, 1,930 staff problems, 1,248 scheduling complaints, 1,089 growth signals, and just 453 legacy tech mentions). 

This reinforces the validation findings—Google reviews aren't a reliable source for identifying ""******* in pain."" The signal-to-noise ratio is too low, and negative reviews often reflect one-off experiences rather than systemic operational dysfunction that would drive software purchasing decisions.

 Based on this analysis, we've assigned each of the 9,732 companies a recommended product (PRODUCT 1, PRODUCT 2, or PRODUCT 3) and a message hook tailored to their dominant signal—though 69% defaulted to the general value proposition since they lacked detectable pain. The actionable output: focus outreach on ***-change signals and ******* maturity rather than trying to infer pain from reviews. The data supports ""you're evolving, here's infrastructure that scales"" messaging over ""we see you're struggling.""

"I think I’ve seen the future of software in how I do my work… and here’s what I think…

Software as we know it is doomed… and not exactly because of vibe coding. Or those grumpy engineers that hate vibe coding.

It’s because it’s designed to trap up in their worldview, with their tools, with interfaces we must click on, with subpar voice interfaces, with all of these opinions that make us adjust OUR behavior to their opinions on what we should do.

I think the future of software willl be more bespoke workflows that are hardened and trusted that I can envoke and pay for like an API.

Will people vibe code their own CRMs, I dunno, that kinda stuff seems sticker to me as it’s critical infrastructure.

But most software is not (meeting note takers, watch out) and most software forces us to use it, to learn it, and to horde our work and make it impossible to export our data.

More so than the data is the context tho, prompts, workflows.

Most software has no place to store our intent, what we want to accomplish, who we are, what our goals are… they all force us to do it their way.

So the huge divide between software and outcomes will be both our context, integrations with our tools that can act autonomously, and compounding plus silo’d understanding of the tasks we need to do.

While engineers moan that “vibe coding will never replace Salesforce because of X, Y, and Z” (true I think), they miss the huge gigantic point that these models:

1. Are amazing at low stakes tasks (daily life)
2. Can capture an understand intent like a person
3. Can build workflows locally to do things that have low risks
4. And that all of the above makes us FASTER at doing TASKS in ONE SHOT.

There’s a revolution coming, slowly but surely, and those that will win will think about how custom code can start eliminating tasks for them.

"Almost all of what I use AI for is collecting and organizing data… almost never writing… and Charlie explains why SO WELL…

Charlie has perfect pitch, he’s an incredible artist. Even Taylor Swift sang about him, “We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.”

The thing about a good message is not that it’s perfect, it’s that it’s authentic.

And the average of many authentic pieces of writing is oddly inauthentic. 

There IS a recipe for authenticity in GTM and it’s petty simple…

1. Understand the organizing principle for why your different types of customers buy (industries, use cases, jobs to be done, pain, etc). You’re looking for what unites buyers besides “they all bought my software.”

2. Go figure out what insight that group of buyers had, WHY you? If it’s because they trusted who referred them, that’s hard. You’re looking for their counter intuitive truth.

3. Use AI to figure out where the data lives where you can find batches of people in this same situation.

Then all you have to do is tell the story you learned in 2 to the customers from the list in 3.

AI won’t replace our creativity and to use to it send creative messages is weirdly missing the point.

You should use it to find the needles in the haystack and to explain what the last needle did to get out. 

And HOW you do it is the art part. And often, the surface area of intelligence from 1 and 2 is SO low or 1 for horizontal SaaS is SO HARD  that you default to mostly blasting stuff. 

But it’s the sitting on the piano moment that can’t be replicated by AI and I think our buyers will know what authenticity sounds like well into the future.

As the noise has increased a ton, but the signal has always sounded the same. 

And just like pornography, as the Supreme Court is famous for saying (paraphrasing), “I can’t define it, but you know it when you see it.”",59.0,14.0,2,75.0,1.11,Teacher,GTM/Sales,Personal Experience,List Post,Text-only,Almost all of what I use AI for is collecting and organizing data… almost never writing… and Charlie,"Almost all of what I use AI for is collecting and organizing data… almost never writing… and Charlie explains why SO WELL…

A man can survive being poor—he’s done it for ten thousand years—but he cannot survive being unnecessary.

The machine doesn’t hate us, doesn’t love us, doesn’t know we exist, and somehow that indifference is the loneliest outcome imaginable.

What people want is to matter, to be needed by something that knows they are there, and the machine offers efficiency but it does not offer that.

So the hate isn’t really about the technology—it’s about the emptiness the technology reveals, the emptiness that was always there, papered over by busyness and the old lie that usefulness equals worth.

5. It tries on 10 again, improves the prompt
6. It gives you quality metrics
7. It gives you instructions on how to ship

"I just feel so much apathy… 

There’s an insidious thing about AI, maybe the most dehumanizing part…

That it makes me question how genuine people are based on the quality of their writing. 

As if they write like AI, I tend to round down and think even less of the message. Like somehow bad message written by a computer is even worse.

I hate questioning if the person sucks at messaging or they suck at using AI, because it’s kinda a question of what is genuine.

Let’s break this message down:

Pros:
1. It talks about me and my post.
2. It connects my value prop with what I do.
3. It mostly feels personalized, like it was written for me.

Cons:
1. It’s so so long.
2. It uses the word “interesting” which is the least interesting word in existence.
3. It says a lot without communicating anything specifically, classic AI sign.
4. It’s asking for 15 mins (a terrible amount of time, like it’s 30 or bust for me)
5. It talks about networking — No busy executive wants to network. They want to solve problems.
6. It’s just so generic as to make me feel the call will be an utter waste of time as there’s no SYNTHESIS of information.

Now contrast tho next message, which is about a specific piece of content, uses the word ingenious, is not asking me for time, and feels authentic to me.

Here’s an exercise, just write yourself a cold message YOU would happily respond to…

Here’s mine…

“Jordan, I’m 42 minutes into your video on systems of actions, systems of record, and systems of information and it’s been 3 months, what’s changed in how you’re building systems of information?”

Or here’s another one,

“Jordan I’ve heard from some friends that you do $3k campaign builds live for people in 2 hours? Can I buy that.”

Or this one,

“Jordan, I run a startup backed by a16z that builds an AI SDR for just logistics companies and we’re building it based on 17 public data sets and we’d like to make you an advisor.”

Or this one,

“Jordan I am pretty sure you’re wrong about Claude Code’s agent mode replacing Claygent—I could only get it to work for like 200 rows. What’s your secret?”

Notice that all of these messages carry specificity, they embed my point of view (the AI SDR one I would take that call because they have talked about HOW they are doing it and made choices that makes it unique).

In the other case, they want to pay me, BANGER!

In the first case they have focused 100% on my ideas, which makes me believe they literally care about the ideas. Which I love talking about of course!

And the last message is actually true, I was wrong!

There’s a thing in blockchain called proof of work, Sam McKenna says it as show me you know me, but I don’t think either of these are useful anymore.

As there are more demands on my time, I dont want you to prove you have read my things, I want you to demonstrate that you have synthesized them, disagree with them, have a damn opinion.

And in a world of AI, the winners will be those who can not just write well, but think well.",41.0,15.0,1,57.0,0.77,Teacher,AI/Automation,Personal Experience,List Post,Text-only,I just feel so much apathy…,"I just feel so much apathy…

"HOT TAKE: SDRs deserve the heated replies they get from prospects.

Each week you see SDRs taking screenshots of replies from buyers that are like… “this person told me to jump off a cliff”

The invariable response looks like this:
1. Shouldn’t they know how sales works
2. We don’t want to work with people like that
3. Yah what a jerk, he must be disturbed

But this totally misses the point because 100% of the empathy is deployed to THE SELLER.

But sales isn’t about feeling sorry for ourselves, it’s not about us, it’s about the buyer.

If we are triggering our buyers to respond like that, don’t WE have the responsibility to not send messages that trigger such replies?

So here are some ideas to not get yelled at:

1. Copy and paste all your transcripts into Claude and ask, “what secrets did buyers share that are counterintuitive and give me their names and titles, here’s a spreadsheet of the calls I have uploaded to correlate them. Now you can share SECRETS of their peers.

2. Go figure out if they are hiring for roles, and see if you know someone and begin with a few recommendations for people in your network (or at your company) that would be good fits.

3. Go figure out your internal company problems and seek out vendors and explain what’s going on internally to VPs of Sales at companies who could help.

4. Go figure out if they are going to a conference and scraoe the attendees list or exhibitor list for them.

5. Want to be BALLER, go figure out who has spoke recently at conferences and send the speakers customized gifts on behalf of the conference. The go to the conference folks and share with them what you did and let them take credit.

6. Do the play above, but for recent case studies. Here’s your intro email “Jordan, I read your case study with bob at frolic construction. I did some research on bob and he loves racing so I’d like to send him a day at the track, paid for by my company, but on your behalf to thank him for his case study. His address is X from what I can tell. You want me to add a custom handwritten note? I have a budget to spend anyways, and might as well do something nice for you instead of cold pitch.”

People are just TIRED of TAKING and SAMENESS.

If you just don’t take, and try to give, and you’re like 15% weirder than everyone else… novelty plus kindness WILDLY pays off.

The only reason I haven’t had to do outbound for my business in a long time is I try to put this type of energy out into the universe.

It pays back at such a dividend that I never need to force my business to grow, it grows on its own, even when my business model is designed for 100% churn.

So stop posting mean replies, earn amazing replies, and recognize that the locus of control is on you.

You’re the only one that can plant the seeds to change your circumstance. To get upset with our buyers is to invite laziness into your thoughts, to invite a mindset of failure.

Go make exceptional experiences for your buyers and you’ll want for nothing.",39.0,16.0,0,55.0,0.74,Contrarian,GTM/Sales,Against Common Wisdom,List Post,Text-only,HOT TAKE: SDRs deserve the heated replies they get from prospects.,"HOT TAKE: SDRs deserve the heated replies they get from prospects.

"There’s ONLY ONE tool you need in 2026 — and it’s not Clay…

It’s your OWN MIND.

Tools come and go, even the best of them, but you’re stuck with your own mind forever.

Exercising it is now easier than ever as AI gives you tremendous leverage and also forces a great burden upon you—weeding through AI slop (not the EMDASH kind).

Put down the screen, let go of your credit card, don’t buy tools.

First think, “if I could do anything right now, with perfect information, what would I do?”

Then have AI help you get as close as possible to that goal.

For once in our lives we finally aren’t confined by our tools as we have a form of intelligence.

But yet, I still see people use this tool to:
1. Personalize messages
2. Figure out which toaster to buy (me too)
3. Ask it the weather 
4. Ask it to write an email
5. Use it like google

Stop thinking from our current toolset and frameworks.

Begin thinking, “if I had all of the world’s knowledge right here in my pocket, what would be the most leverage I could get from it in my job.” 

Hell, even ask AI that question.

We have a thinking partner that never gets tired, never sleeps, who no complex question is too hard, and who can convincingly bullshit.

But if it doesn’t have a good sparring companion, then all it will do is slap you in the face and convince you it loves you and that you’re right.

"$80M in funding and their main claim to fame is they are out of stealth with 90 EMPLOYEES... what the hell is going on in GTM tech?

I am always a little bit saddened when I see these consolidation plays at SUPER early stage startups, because they are launching new technology with old world thinking... 

Old World Thinking:
1. Build 1 tool to take over 10 (that means competing against 10 tools).
2. Build a HUGE THING before you've sold much of anything.
3. Build a BUNCH of product surface area where you can't be the best in the world at any of it.
4. Make no compromises to achieve greatness. 
5. Thinking that volume eclipses value for a particular customer. 

That one complex thing can do it all for all horizontal SaaS companies... and my guess is with $80M in funding they have less than $1M in ARR so there's just SO MUCH surface area built of total total guesswork and it's increasing, too.

Ironically, these GTM companies usually have the hardest time going to market because they really are designed to make for impossible sales. If it really worked, they would be able to turn it on and it would have printed customers.

Here's what their sale looks like:

1. Replace all your current GTM tech (for MM companies) OR install this HUGE 
bloated thing when you have nothing (for seed stage companies with no PMF)
2. Take a GIGANTIC bet on this one system.
3. We do so much, so any ONE thing likely isn't going to be great.

And reading articles that say things like...

""Since its inception, Reevo has bolstered its team to 90 employees, anchored by senior engineers and proven leaders from Affirm, Airbnb, Box, DoorDash, HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, Square, Rippling, and Uber.""

^--- All vanity metrics and what does Airbnb know about B2B SaaS GTM?

If you're spending money on slick ass videos, it means you haven't changed people's lives. That should be our metric.

Congrats to this team, and I'm really sad to say, I think this won't go anywhere given how hard the product team has worked to make the GTM's team live miserable and awful.

If I'm wrong, I'm looking forward to being embarrassed on a huge billboard in 2030. But, I wouldn't bet against me.

"“Congrats on scaling Blueprint” <— NEVER try to scale a compliment and here’s why…

The whole purpose of a compliment is that it’s from the heart, genuine. 

Also, the whole purpose of automation for sales is to open up conversations.

But how you begin impacts where and if you get to end. 

This is why I have only two frameworks for messaging:

PQS
PVP

A PQS is a pain qualified segment and it simply means that the list is the message, 

“Jordan given that you post everyday and comment on 10 posts or so a day, you spend a ton of time on LinkedIn, no? If you could be shown only Vertical SaaS CROs and CEOs in your feed—would that likely mark your comments more powerful?”

The list you’d build in this case is active commenters on linkedin who are engaging a lot with non-ICP accounts (if this was a product—like customized LinkedIn feed).

A PVP is a message SO GOOD you’d pay to received it. Permissionless Value Prop. Here’s what that would look like…

“Jordan, given your activity on LinkedIn, and that only 10% of your last 100 comments were on vSaaS brands—I thought I’d give you a list of 500 CROs and CEOs of vSaaS B2B brands that posted on linkedin 20+ times in the last month, and here’s a ChatGPT prompt to have Atlas auto-follow each one.”

This is a message that carries independent value to me.

Nothing about fake compliments or ball fluffery, just pure hard value.

Then, when you get on the call, tell me I have beautiful blue eyes or some garbage. That way I know it’s true and you e protected your integrity and you can skippy do dah in the rain with your automated quality messages at scale.",36.0,12.0,0,48.0,0.68,Teacher,GTM/Sales,Framework/How-To,Observation/Opinion,Text-only,“Congrats on scaling Blueprint” <— NEVER try to scale a compliment and here’s why…,"“Congrats on scaling Blueprint” <— NEVER try to scale a compliment and here’s why…

"AI message personalization is A CANCER on sales and here’s what to do INSTEAD…

Think about what just happened in this message…

===============
“{{generic summarized fact about me that sounds like a robot wrote it}}”

“Here’s what everyone does”

“Here’s what we do”

“We are cheap and crappy”

An offer to read more
===============

Why does this suck you ask? Oh let me count the ways.

1. Let’s just assume you can fix the intro to make it less robot, the problem is that because the targeting is just “founders” dude literally told me about my own work and completely violated the teachings, without even addressing that. Which mean it’s a lie, he didn’t read my work. So the message is now hollow.

Let’s now also assume he fixed the “personalized” line and it felt unique an authentic and like he meant it. Just go with me.

2. Here’s the hardest part, the insight, just describing my situation. Well bro is cooked out the gate, because his insight is literally what I solve for… so he has NO CHANCE.

3. A value prop of we save money is not nearly as good as “I already did something useful for you, want more?” That’s what a true PVP would look like.

Personalized emails, no matter how well done, can’t recover from poor lists. There’s no message no universe where I would buy this.

If you’re selling pregnancy test kits you should target women who go to fertility clinics monthly. 

Because no amount of amazing personalized messages will convince a gay man he should buy a pregnancy test.

Not to put too fine of a point on this, but if you manually inspect your list and you find someone that literally sells a variant of what you do, then your list sucks. And if your list sucks, your message has no chance.

You can’t write your way out of a targeting problem, but you can target your way out of a pipeline problem.

The real question is, do you REALLY know who should and shouldn’t buy and why? 

Answer that question first and the targeting and messaging will be easy, because it’s just weeding out the bad prospects and describing to the good ones why they should receive your message.",34.0,12.0,0,46.0,0.64,Teacher,GTM/Sales,Personal Experience,List Post,Text-only,AI message personalization is A CANCER on sales and here’s what to do INSTEAD…,"AI message personalization is A CANCER on sales and here’s what to do INSTEAD…

Just do whatever you’re doing, and before you ship to the customer, read what you wrote.

And look at it and then say…

“What would I learn about my customer to be able to communicate more artfully about their exact problem… to EARN the right to help them think about where my solution fits or doesn’t fit within their problem…”

Thing 2:

Just ask a customer about their research, their options, what mattered to them, why, what they didn’t consider. Inhabit their worldview.

You can’t own framing the problem if you’re clueless about their world, and you can’t know where you best fit in if you don’t know where other tools best you.

The art comes in talking about HOW you do what you do NOT outcomes. You need to have a POV that makes what you do compelling.

"Stop using SignalR for every real-time feature in .NET.

If you only need to push data from the server to the client, you might be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

While SignalR is a powerhouse for two-way communication, it can be heavy for simple ""server push"" scenarios.

Starting with ASPNET Core 10, we have a native, lightweight alternative: 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 (𝗦𝗦𝗘).

In my latest video, I walk you through the implementation of native SSE, which allows the server to communicate with the client on demand over a single, persistent HTTP connection.

".NET 10 is officially released! 🎉

Here are the top updates 👇

First, .NET 10 is an LTS (long-term support) release. So we get support for the next 3 years.

🔥 Performance improvements

Under the hood, .NET 10 delivers major performance boosts. The JIT compiler has been tuned with new optimizations such as de‑abstraction, smarter inlining heuristics and constant‑folding, allowing the runtime to do more work at compile‑time rather than at run‑time. There are many other optimizations across collections and LINQ, which translate to tangible speedups across everyday workloads.

🚀 Aspire goes polyglot

Formerly .NET Aspire, Aspire is now a polyglot, developer‑first platform for orchestrating front ends, APIs, containers and databases. Version 9.5 introduces a preview of a single‑file AppHost, letting you define and run your entire distributed application in a single file. The release also debuts a Generative AI visualizer to inspect and debug prompts and responses, plus expanded AI support with typed clients for GitHub Models and Azure AI Foundry and first‑class OpenAI integration.

🔗 EF Core’s new LeftJoin/RightJoin operators

LINQ’s lack of a built‑in outer join has long been a pain point. EF Core 10 fixes this by adding LeftJoin and RightJoin operators, so the code now reads exactly like the SQL you intend. For example, you can join products to reviews using LeftJoin() and EF will generate the correct LEFT JOIN statement under the hood. A corresponding RightJoin() keeps all rows from the right side while bringing in matches from the left. These new operators eliminate the verbose GroupJoin + DefaultIfEmpty pattern and make LINQ queries easier to read and maintain.

"I upgraded my Clean Architecture template to .NET 10.

And it took only a few minutes. Here's how 👇

My .NET version is defined in one place, a Build props file. I updated to net10 and that took care of all the projects in the solution.

The next part was updating the NuGet packages.

This was equally simple with central package management. I updated the version in the Packages props file, and it was picked up by all the projects in the solution.

Here's what's inside:
- Simple domain model with Domain Events pattern
- CQRS (no MediatR) + clean use cases implementation
- Validation and logging cross-cutting concerns
- Authentication with JWT and user context
- Boilerplate for RBAC authorization
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Minimal APIs, health checks

IExceptionHandler implements the ""try-"" pattern.

You can decide which exceptions to handle.

To tell the middleware you handled the exception, you return true.

So, what makes this so interesting?

You can also chain multiple exception handlers that will run sequentially.

"I failed an interview because I didn't know how locks work in C#.

Read this to make sure it never happens to you.

I've told this story a couple of times before, but it's worth repeating.

I was in an interview some 7-8 years ago, doing a live coding exercise.

I was integrating with a currency conversion API and needed to add caching.

The problem was how this would scale with multiple concurrent requests.

A classic cache stampede problem.

I wanted to prevent this with locking.

Locking allows us to control how many threads can access some piece of code.

Note that I rarely worked with low-level code.

But the company I was interviewing for does.

Of course, they'd have this in the interview process.

Here's the situation:

- I knew I needed a locking mechanism
- But the method was async (oof!)
- So I tried to solve this using the `lock` statement

And that's where it all went to shit...

The `lock` statement doesn't work with async-await.

And it makes sense.

You can't guarantee which thread will complete the method.

So what's the solution?

You need to use an asynchronous synchronization primitive.

Luckily, C # has many to choose from.

Semaphore, SemaphoreSlim, Mutex, Monitor, etc.

Two important remarks:

1) Use a timeout when waiting on the semaphore
2) Always release the lock with a try-finally

Here's a tough question for you.

How would you implement a lock in a database?

Would you have nailed this interview?

"The riskiest line of code you'll write today is the one without a feature flag.

Fortunately, .NET has you covered right out of the box.

Feature flags are a software development technique that allows you to wrap application features in a conditional statement.

You can then toggle the feature on or off at runtime to control which features are enabled.

.NET already has feature flag support built in.

You can use the IFeatureManager in your code to check whether a feature is enabled.

Want to learn more about using feature flags?

Check out this article: https://lnkd.in/ddxmMg4V

There are many popular services for managing feature flags.

I've used LaunchDarkly often, and recently also PostHog (it offers many more features).

"Not all Load Balancing strategies are created equal.

If you are using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) in .NET, you have 5 built-in ways to distribute traffic. But which one should you choose?

Here is the breakdown:

1. RoundRobin: The classic. It cycles through servers evenly. Simple, but it assumes all servers are equally fast.

2. LeastRequests: The smart choice. It sends traffic to the server currently doing the least work.

3. Random: It picks a server at random. Surprisingly effective for high-volume, uniform workloads.

4. PowerOfTwoChoices: The balanced approach. It picks two random servers and chooses the one with fewer requests. It avoids the overhead of checking every server.

5. FirstAlphabetical: The ""sticky"" one. It always picks the first available server. Good for failover setups, bad for load distribution.

Most people stick with RoundRobin, but switching to LeastRequests can significantly improve tail latency in systems where request times vary.

I dive deeper into how to scale horizontally using YARP here: https://lnkd.in/daDNMpmB

"How did we make a simple idea so complicated?

CQRS is the simplest pattern out there.

First, there was CQS: Command Query Separation.

What does this mean? We split an object's methods into write (command) and read (query) methods.

CQRS is the evolution of CQS. CQRS works on the architectural level. At the same time, CQS works on the method (or class) level.

The CQRS pattern uses separate models for reading and updating data.

This separation can be logical OR physical.

My preferred approach is starting with logical CQRS.

One database + separate flows for writes and reads.

You can design a data model fine-tuned for each operation.

A lot of developers stay away from CQRS because they think it's complex.

The reality is you're probably already applying CQRS principles without knowing it.

Here's a simple implementation: https://lnkd.in/d-qUdpn3

"In .NET, you usually have to choose between Speed and Consistency.

In-Memory Caching (IMemoryCache):
✅ Blazing fast (nanoseconds).
❌ Data is stuck on one server. If you have 10 nodes, you have 10 caches.

Distributed Caching (IDistributedCache / Redis):
✅ Shared across all servers. Consistent data.
❌ Network latency. Serialization costs. It's slower.

The Solution: HybridCache.

Don't choose one. Use both.

A Hybrid Cache creates a tiered architecture:

- L1 (Local): The app checks RAM first. If it's there, return instantly.
- L2 (Distributed): If missing locally, check Redis.
- Source: If missing in Redis, fetch from DB, then populate both L1 and L2.

While Microsoft is working on a native implementation, I still swear by FusionCache as the most robust, battle-tested library for this.

"I love working with the Service Discovery library in .NET.

It's a lightweight configuration-based approach.

This actually came out of the effort done in Aspire.

If you're new to this concept, here's a quick breakdown.

Service discovery allows developers to reference external services using logical names instead of physical IP addresses and ports.

There's a centralized store for services to register themselves.

Clients can query the service registry to find the service's physical address.

The service discovery library for .NET is simpler, though.

It still lets you use logical names to refer to external services.

However, the discovery side is ""lacking"".

You have to specify the physical addresses in the application settings.

Here's a step-by-step tutorial: https://lnkd.in/eX4Wy3jD

You can configure the service URLs during deployment in your CI/CD pipelines.

Or even use a central configuration store (Azure App Configuration) for service discovery URLs.

"I like my API endpoints ""thin"".

If I can have controllers (or Minimal APIs) with 4-5 lines of code, that'd be best.

Here's why you should implement this.

The API endpoint's only responsibility becomes:

1. Accepting a request
2. Constructing a command/query object
3. Sending it to the respective handler and getting a result

The best part?

You don't need MediatR.

With it going commercial, I'm sure many people will switch away.

"The worst kind of bug is the one that explodes 3 days after deployment.

This is the hidden danger of the standard Options Pattern in .NET.

You might bind your appsettings.json to a class, inject it, and everything looks fine. The app starts up perfectly.

But if a required API Key is missing? You won't know until a user triggers that specific feature, and the app crashes.

This is why ""Fail Fast"" is crucial for configuration.

If your config is invalid, your application should refuse to start. Period.

You can achieve this by extending the Options Pattern with IValidateOptions.

Instead of just binding data, you attach validation logic:

1. Define rules (e.g., ""ApiKey cannot be null"", ""RetryCount must be > 0"").
2. Register the validator.
3. If the config breaks the rules, the DI container throws an exception immediately at startup.

I took this a step further and integrated FluentValidation to make the rules cleaner and more expressive.

"If you need to run a task ""Every Friday at 5 PM,"" how do you implement it?

A While(true) loop with a Thread.Sleep() is not the answer.

You need a robust scheduler that understands Cron Expressions.

A Cron expression allows you to define complex recurring schedules with a compact string.

For example:

• 15 10 * * * = 10:15 AM every day.
• 15 10 * * MON-FRI = 10:15 AM, but only on weekdays.

In the .NET ecosystem, the heavyweight champion for this is Quartz.

Clean code is code that's:

- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand

Writing clean code is a skill.

It's a skill you can learn and improve with practice.

In the initial example:

- Nesting increases complexity
- Nesting makes the code harder to reason about

The solution is to combine the nested IF statements into a single IF.

Three ways you can do this:

- Write an inline boolean expression
- Expose a method with the expression
- Create a variable with the expression

"I rewrote a 40-year-old APL system to a modern tech stack.

It powers a $10M manufacturing business with 460+ database tables.

Here are 5 lessons I learned in 4 years:

1. Start with core business logic first

2. Modular architecture is worth the investment

3. Data sync is harder than you think

4. Balance technical needs with business pressure

5. Document institutional knowledge before it's gone

"What is Claims Transformation in ASPNET Core?

You can use it to extend your authorization logic by adding dynamic claims at runtime.

If your Identity Provider's access token doesn't perfectly align with your application's internal authorization needs, you can use claims transformation.

Claims transformation allows you to modify the claims before the application uses them for authorization.

You can use this to fill in the missing claims from your database or another source.

Here's why this is helpful: https://lnkd.in/eMsd69UY

EF Core is fast, but only if you use the right tools.

Here are 5 features that will speed up your data access:

1. Query Splitting: Stops ""Cartesian Explosion"" by breaking huge JOINs into separate SQL queries.

2. Bulk Updates: ExecuteUpdate() modifies rows directly in the DB. Zero memory allocation.

3. Bulk Deletes: ExecuteDelete() wipes data instantly without fetching it first.

4. Raw SQL: Sometimes LINQ generates bad SQL. Raw SQL lets you take the wheel for complex queries.

5. IgnoreQueryFilters: Perfect for Admin dashboards where you need to see ""Soft Deleted"" data or tenant-specific records.

"Cursor pagination is blazing fast.

But it's not a good solution for every situation. Here's why. 👇

Cursor pagination uses a reference point (cursor) to fetch the next page of results.

This reference point must be a unique identifier or a combination of fields that define the sort order.

My tests showed cursor pagination was 17x faster compared to offset pagination.

So why don't we always use it?

Cursor pagination works particularly well for real-time feeds and infinite scroll interfaces.

If most users start at the first page and rarely visit other pages, offset pagination might be sufficient. This will be the case for many applications.

"Implementing resilience in .NET? You better...

Polly is probably your first choice.

And Polly is much faster in V8+.

But why should you care about making your application resilient?

Let's say your services communicate by sending HTTP requests.

HTTP requests can fail because of network or server issues.

These failures can disrupt service availability, especially as dependencies increase. This increases the risk of cascading failures.

Luckily, there's a simple way to solve this in your .NET applications.

Here's how you can make your apps resilient: https://lnkd.in/e39__DXH

Do you use Polly in your applications?

There's also an official resilience library in .NET.

"How do you handle a transaction that spans 3 different microservices?

You can't use a standard Database Transaction (ACID) because the data lives in different places.

You need a Saga.

And a Saga is essentially just a State Machine with memory.

It tracks the progress of a workflow:

1. Current State: ""OrderPlaced""
2. Event: ""PaymentReceived""
3. Transition: Move to ""OrderPaid"" state and send a command to the Shipping Service.

If something fails (e.g., ""ShippingFailed""), the State Machine triggers a specific ""Compensating Action"" to undo the previous steps (e.g., Issue Refund).

It turns chaos into a deterministic workflow.

You can see a full code example of an Order Saga here: https://lnkd.in/d6jY3KaP

Sagas are complex at first, but they are a lifesaver for data consistency.

"I spent 2 days speeding up an API endpoint...

And I made it 15x faster.

The endpoint did heavy calculations and pulled data from several services, so it didn’t scale.

My process was simple:

- Find the slowest code
- Fix the queries
- Cut external calls
- Add caching last

Measure everything. The slow parts were obvious:

- DB calls inside a loop
- Repeated external calls
- Duplicate calculations

Database round trips cost time, so avoid loops and batch what you can.

Independent service calls? Run them concurrently.

Still slow? Add caching with clear expiration rules (IMemoryCache / IDistributedCache).

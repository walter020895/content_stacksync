"It's the end of an era: I've exited Refine Labs. 

Last week, I sold all my remaining shares in Refine Labs to existing shareholders and a private investment firm for an undisclosed amount.

This marks the close of a chapter in my life and career that I will always look back on with deep appreciation for the journey, pride in what we built, and excitement for what’s next, for both Refine Labs and me. 

When I started Refine Labs from my South Boston apartment in 2019, I had three freelance customers, no employees, and $3,000 in my bank account. No investors. No social media presence. No impressive resume. Just a vision:

-To create the place where future B2B CMOs are forged.
-To design growth systems for the most iconic and emerging brands in SaaS.
-To push the boundaries and move the industry forward.

Refine Labs became exactly that. And far more.

To the current and former Refine Labs team - thank you. You brought the vision to life with relentless excellence, care for our customers, and a commitment to innovation.

To Gaetano DiNardi - co-hosting 100+ live shows together changed the trajectory of this company and helped thousands of GTM pros level up.

To Megan Bowen - your integrity, leadership, and unwavering commitment over the past five years have been the foundation of our culture and growth. Thank you.

To everyone who attended Demand Gen Live, tuned into the podcasts, or followed the journey on LinkedIn: your support has meant so much to me. 

I’m proud of everything we accomplished together. 

Over six years, we partnered with 250+ leading SaaS companies. 

We helped forge a new wave of CMOs who are both strategists and tacticians. 

Refine Labs alumni have gone on to lead Marketing teams at top brands or build companies of their own. 

Thousands of podcast listeners used the insights to get promoted, reimagine their careers, and drive impact in their orgs.

I’m excited for the future, both for me and for Refine Labs. 

Refine Labs will continue to operate and deliver for customers as it always has, with the same team, same leadership, and same customer focus. I’ll be cheering from the sidelines.

And for me, I’m turning the page. A new chapter is beginning. Just like when Refine Labs was only a vision, I’ve started seeing something new for what the future holds and how I can contribute. I’ll share more in time.

For now, I’m just grateful.

To every team member, customer, listener, and supporter—thank you. We made something really special.

The best is yet to come. Here’s to the next era.

"CONFIRMED WITH DATA: Paid social lead gen on Facebook & LinkedIn is terribly inefficient and provides very low ROI.

The same thing I’ve been saying for 6 years, now confirmed in a MASSIVE data set.

Metadata released their second B2B advertising benchmark report and the results are….ummmm….not good.

But this is an absolutely groundbreaking data set for B2B companies. Especially given the scale:

$42MM in total advertising spend
236,000 total “leads” collected
And all of the associated downstream data for pipeline & conversion rates

Here’s the breakdown and my analysis of the data set:

1. 90% of advertising dollars were spent on lead gen campaigns ($37MM of $42MM total spend)

This is consistent with what I see in my own analyses of over 100 companies. B2B companies primarily use paid social for lead gen campaigns because of the outdated demand waterfall models & requirements for digital touchpoint-based attribution.

2. “Download” was the most popular CTA indicating that B2B companies are still using paid social to drive downloads of gated PDFs (shhheeeesh!).

The average cost was $126 to get someone to maybe open the PDF.

3. Based on the data, I estimate the lead-to-win % to be 0.3%. That means Sales needs 333 “leads” to win 1 deal, which is terribly inefficient.

This is consistent with what I see in my own analyses - average lead-to-win rate I see is somewhere between 0.1% - 0.2%, meaning Sales needs 500-1000 paid social “leads” to win a deal. The Metadata report is similar and confirms these inefficiencies in a very large sample size.

4. Low cost per lead does not indicate actual success.

The average cost per “lead” was $172 across all lead gen campaigns. But given the very very very low win rate of these leads, we estimate advertising CAC to be $57,000 to win one deal. This is just the advertising cost and doesn’t include Sales headcount, SDRs, marketing headcount, or other marketing programs such as events. It’s safe to say this performance is totally unacceptable.

5. Estimated advertising CAC payback period is estimated to be 21 months.

$38MM in total advertising spend on lead gen campaigns resulting in $22MM in closed won revenue.

This is just the advertising cost and doesn’t include Sales headcount, SDRs, marketing headcount, or other marketing programs such as events. When you include all the other expenditures, you could reasonably estimate the total CAC payback on these programs is more than 48 months (meaning it takes 4 years just to pay back the cost of acquiring the customer, not adjusted for gross margin)

____

There is FINALLY sufficient data to say definitively that almost all B2B companies should STOP running lead gen campaigns on LinkedIn & Facebook.

"It’s been 90 days since I’ve had a drink of alcohol, and I feel superhuman. 

I’ve tracked my performance and habits for more than 5 years using WHOOP and in my data it’s super clear:

Alcohol is one of the worst things you can do to limit your performance - both physically and mentally. 

There’s a shift happening in Austin, TX and I’m sure it’s happening in other parts of the World as well, where lots of people are choosing to abstain from alcohol. 

There’s starting to be less of a negative stigma around not drinking alcohol, thankfully. It's crazy that for so long it's been socially weird to *not* drink alcohol, despite the clear, obvious data about the negative effects. 

In the business World and in lots of B2B companies I’ve worked at before, “Culture” revolves around alcohol. 

Let’s get everyone drunk at Sales Kickoff so people can bond. 

Let’s have a networking event at a bar. 

Let’s do a happy hour for business development. 

Let’s all go out to the club in Vegas and then be hungover in the tradeshow booth all day tomorrow. 

Hopefully more companies and the business World at large start to shift away from this outdated social norm. 

__

I'm not sure this is a forever thing for me, but it's definitely working for me right now. 

When I make changes in my life and start to feel a lot of positive momentum, I always keep it going. 

Lots of people say the positive effects continue to grow the longer you abstain from alcohol. I'll continue to report back on my own personal experience. 

Anyone else trying this? Seeing this shift? What's been your experience? 

It feels like this is a topic we need more on LinkedIn and in business generally.

"Here’s how our 3-person Marketing team puts out more content every day than most $100MM companies put out in a month:

1. Commit

You must be committed to executing on the right activities for a sustained period of time. Most companies fail at this because they do 3 podcasts & give up when they don’t get any “leads”.

2. Identify Your Subject Matter Expert(s)

Provide forward-thinking, relevant information that your buyers *want*. Most B2B marketing content doesn’t hit because the person creating the content isn't an expert and doesn’t deeply understand the buyer.

3. Content Creation Framework

Put pillars in the ground that help you create content on a recurring basis. Example: we host Tik Tok Live every Tuesday and bi-weekly live Revenue Strategy events. These pillars create raw content. We have 3 total recurring pillars.

4. Post-Production framework

Create a framework to *quickly* edit raw long-form content & optimize it for each distribution channel. We publish recorded content within 24 hours, while big companies take 3 months to do the same thing.

5. *Effective* Multi-Channel Distribution

Content makes ZERO impact if your buyers don’t *consume* it. You must spend a lot of time in the DETAILS on each channel listening & engaging.

"In early 2019, I started calling out how badly the “lead gen” Marketing model was working. Tons of smart, experienced people argued with me and told me I was an idiot. 

5 years later, it’s common knowledge that most high-volume lead gen Marketing models are ineffective, inefficient, and not financially viable. 

I knew for sure it wasn’t working because I had analyzed 20+ B2B company’s CRM data and saw the same consistent pattern at every one:

1. 90%+ of Marketing program budgets spent on Lead Generation strategies 
2. Marketing gets thousands of MQLs and celebrates $100 cost per “lead” 
3. “Leads” convert to customers at 0.1% 
4. 1,000 SDR follow up cadences to Close 1 deal 
5. 5-10+ year CAC payback periods 

IT WAS OBVIOUS. 

But nobody had taken the time and critical thinking to look at the data this way across a broad range of companies to see the clear, obvious pattern. 

It took YEARS for smart people to understand the nuances of my message. Thousands of people changed their careers and lives by recognizing the opportunity early and taking action. Others lagged behind for years. And now 5 years later everyone sees it as common knowledge.

____

And at this moment right now, the same thing is happening. 

At Passetto, we’ve analyzed 50+ B2B companies' CRM, revenue, and financial data. 

The traditional GTM model is broken - super inefficient and entirely unsustainable. But the METRICS companies use blind them to this reality. And the METRICS companies use unknowingly keep them handcuffed to this broken model - decimating growth rate, GTM Efficiency, and enterprise value creation. 

And again, smart, experienced people are criticizing my message and disparaging me for it without taking the 30 minutes to understand my message and all of the supporting data. 

IT’S OBVIOUS. 

The only way to fix it is to change the GTM KPI stack and the Financial Planning process. Which then drives organizational alignment, investment allocation, and department-level accountability downstream. 

I’ve seen this story before. 

Maybe it will take 6 months, 12 months, or a few years for everyone to see this reality. But in a few short years, this will also be common knowledge :)

"Unpopular Opinion: You can clearly determine how well your Marketing is ""working"" without ever looking at attribution. 

And the way to get there is by focusing on *business KPIs* 

TTM Growth Rate %
GTM Efficiency % 
Total Pipeline Created
Total Investment to Create Pipe 
Pipeline Opp Win Rate 
Investments to Create Pipe : Total Pipe Created

And boom: you'll get a clear picture that aligns everyone in GTM on the current performance and historical trends. 

Example $100MM ARR SaaS Company:

Growth rate: 24% (decent growth)
GTM Efficiency: 428% (highly inefficient)
Total Pipe Created: $48MM
Total Investment to Create Pipe: $27.6MM
Pipeline Opp Win Rate: 8% (down from 12% YoY)
Pipeline:Spend Ratio : $1.74 (really bad) 

You don't need to build a multi-touch attribution report. Or split the credit between ""Inbound"" and ""Outbound"". Or debate how much ""brand value"" is created from all the trade show booths. None of it. 

This performance is abysmal and unsustainable. If continued for several more years, this company will undoubtedly crash and burn. Alarms should have been going off at the Exec level and Board level for the past 4+ quarters. 

Yet, the Marketing QBR reports show increasing MQL performance, great cost/MQL, and an overly complicated influenced revenue report that shows how well everything is working (yet nobody really understands). 

All of the Marketing reports are built by Managers and Directors who have little to no visibility into the broader business context - that growth is slowing and CAC has inflated by almost 3X in the past 6 quarters. 

__

As a Finance or GTM Executive, you cannot rely on bottoms-up department-level reporting to build and optimize your GTM. Instead, you *must*:

1. Align on a Unified set of GTM KPIs that don't rely on attribution 
2. Start with Investor Level & Financial Level KPIs, particularly growth rate and GTM Efficiency % 
3. Break the investments and performance down across the customer lifecycle (not by the GL / Dept code) 
4. Analyze the performance, historical trends, and unit economics across each core phase of the customer lifecycle. 
5. Rapidly identify the biggest issues and opportunities to unlock growth and ROI.
6. Map and track strategic priorities against BUSINESS KPIs (not attribution)

Then, with all of this BUSINESS CONTEXT. You can start to run custom diagnostics with W-shaped attribution, or linear, or signal-based, or sliced by GEO / segment / vertical or anything else to answer specific questions you have based on the business KPIs. 

Always look at attribution data with a purpose based on business-level KPIs.

B2B companies come up with a million excuses and objections about why not to do it:

“We need our rep to talk to the customer to ‘provide value’ first before we tell them the price.”

“If we publish pricing on our website, our competitors will find out and undercut us.” (lol as if your competitors can’t figure out your pricing on their own)

“Our pricing is way too complicated. If we publish it, our customers will get confused and won’t talk to our Sales team.”

And a million different iterations of these objections and excuses that are all about the company and nothing about the customer. Every excuse has everything to do with what you want and zero to do with what the customer wants.

__

The most black & white way to address this at your company - which is exactly what I did in 2017 - was I ran a survey to all the decision makers at our Tier 1 & Tier 2 accounts.

One of the questions was: When buying XYZ technology, what steps in your buying process would you like to accomplish *before* you talk to a Sales representative?

More than 600 total accounts responded.

93% of the respondents said they want to know the price before they talk with a Sales rep.

There it is. Simple. 600 decision makers at target accounts telling you exactly how they want to buy. Are you going to listen to your customers or are you going to be selfish and only think about what you want?

It’s black and white. If you ask your target customers the exact same question, you would get the exact same answer.

If you’re customer-centric, it’s obvious you would publish pricing on your website.

Instead, they’ll go to Vendr and get the best price w/o any of the nonsense. And the B2B company will take a 30-45% cut on margin between discounting & referral fees, all because they refuse to be customer-centric in their Sales process.

"Basically every B2B company is questioning their BDR/SDR strategy right now. 

Because the mass manufacturing strategy of MORE Leads, MORE SDR Headcount, and MORE Spam Cannons have created an inefficiency spiral:

Need More ""leads"" -> Lower conversion -> Inflated Costs -> Repeat. 

The cycle has spiraled out of control to a level where it now costs a B2B company 2-5X more money to acquire $1 in incremental ARR. 

The ""Predictable Revenue"" model has become entirely unsustainable.  

__

I'm old enough to remember what “Business Development” used to look like before the Predictable Revenue model came on the scene in the early 2010’s. 

Business Development teams were small teams of experienced professionals who:

-Have strong business acumen and executive presence

-Have strong domain expertise and industry experience

-Have strong connections in the industry and are respected in the industry 

-Focused on developing relationships & opportunities in large, strategic accounts (partners, Tier 1 accounts, OEMs, new markets/verticals)

-Leverage an integrated combination of physical events, in person meetings, and inside sales activities to create and close big opportunities 

-Compensated and incentivized based on creating and closing REVENUE

But here we are in 2024, and the Predictable Revenue model that has become an ""industry standard"" in tech & SaaS is cracking like cheap glass:

-Inexperienced people who don’t have strong business acumen or executive presence

-No domain expertise or industry knowledge

-No connections in the industry or awareness in the industry

-Focused often on chasing around small accounts & small deals where the SDR role just dramatically increases CAC to untenable levels 

-Only leverage inside sales using spam cannon technology to flood buyers with unpersonalized, irrelevant digital messaging asking for meetings 

-Compensated and incentivized to book meetings and hit a volume of “activities” 

____

It's pretty simple to see why the current ""industry standard"" is falling short for B2B companies, and more importantly, for their customers. 

In the future, we’re going to see a big change to how “Business Development” works in B2B companies. 

We’re going to go back to basics. Back to the fundamentals. 

Where experienced, respected, highly competent people leverage an integrated approach to develop and close new opportunities with high-value accounts. 

And a lot of the low value work done by inexperienced people to low value accounts will be automated and removed by AI. 

Time to go back to basics.

"Even the Top 1% of Go-To-Market (GTM) teams I interact with make this simple, massively painful mistake 👇 

Planning and measuring GTM based on which *department* sourced the lead. 

Most SaaS companies are trying to implement a “Four Funnel” MQL Waterfall Model and it 100% will not fix their GTM. 

“Marketing Sourced” vs. “SDR Sourced” vs. “Sales Sourced” vs “Partner Sourced”

It sounds great and easy in theory, so they can divide lead source credit between Marketing, Sales, SDRs, and Partners. And then put together the most BASIC, INADEQUATE revenue model that looks great in an Excel spreadsheet, but will 100% fail in real life. 

It’s even being taught at the most popular “schools” for CMOs & CROs. 

This model is considered a best practice in the industry and meanwhile is the main cause of Go-To-Market Dysfunction leading to Slowed Growth, GTM Team Misalignment and Inflated CAC. 

It’s the equivalent of a Car Factory trying to decide which department made the car:

""30% of the cars got made by the people who put the wheels on""

""40% of the cars got made by the people who ordered the supplies and raw materials""
 
""10% of the cars got made by the people who do incoming inspection on the raw materials""
 
""20% of the cars got made by the people who assemble the dashboard electronics"" 

Do you see how stupid this is yet? 

You need everyone in the Car Factory to do their part to build the car. 

And you need everyone in your Revenue Factory to do their part to get every closed won customer and every renewal/expansion. 

Trying to give credit to any department for building the car literally makes no sense. 

And it’s time to bring that common sense into B2B go-to-market. 

Stop using department-level attribution as a replacement to your Strategic & Operational KPIs. Start planning, measuring and optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory 

#finance #gtm #gotomarket #sales #marketing

I understand the ""Four Funnel MQL Model"" deeply, have implemented it many times, and personally recommended it from 2018-2022. But it will 100% fail in today’s environment because it does not produce SCALABLE UNIT ECONOMICS.

This highly inefficient model makes it “easy” for Finance to do annual planning and try to measure ROI yet basically impossible to scale, plan, forecast, diagnose, and optimize.

For mature companies, billions of dollars in enterprise value are on the line over the next few years……So be careful where you get your advice from -

"Most “inbound” leads are not actually inbound. 

They just get tagged that way because they come from Marketing. 

It’s actually just because you have some data and have been able to architect that data to triggers Sales to reach out to someone that didn’t ask to talk to you. 

An MQL score is not an “inbound” lead. 

Neither is an e-book download. 

Neither is a webinar attendee. 

Neither is a PQL. 

And these types of “leads” make up 90% or more of the total “inbound” volume. 

___

This distinction of “Inbound” and “Outbound” leads is super outdated for this exact reason. 

Instead, segment how Sales/SDRs follow up by:

(1) Declared Intent - A qualified buyer declares intent to buy by asking to speak with your Sales team about buying (Demo Request, Contact Form, Talk to Sales, Get Pricing, etc.). 

This segment of buyers should entirely bypass the SDR role and go directly to an experienced rep that can truly help the customer and close the deal. 

Figure out what you need to do operationally to create an efficient buying experience for your customer and make it happen for your customer. 

Plus, stop sending your best prospects (declared intent) to your least experienced people (SDRs). 

(2) Not Declared Intent - A qualified buyer doesn’t specifically ask to talk to your Sales team about buying, but we have *signals* that drives Sales to reach out to try to get a meeting. 

This is a massive segment of buyers who have shown some *signals* of intent that should be queued and prioritized for outreach. 

Look at ALL the available signals across the entire GTM and optimize the timing, targeting, channel, message, and offers to this large pool of potentially in-market buyers. 

Build a Pipeline Architecture to track every single signal that drives Sales/SDRs to outreach and the disposition of that outreach all the way through the Sales process to Closed Won/Lost. 

___

Most “inbound” leads are not actually inbound. They just get tagged that way because they come from Marketing. 

It’s time to break down the outdated department-level silo’s that prevent us from seeing the bigger picture and optimizing a holistic GTM strategy. 

The future is an account-based, signal-driven, integrated GTM Team. And that requires an entirely different set of KPIs, terminology, and analytics to plan, report, analyze, diagnose, and optimize the investments and strategy across all the GTM departments.

"4 years ago, I told the 3 main ABM vendors they had a huge problem and none of them cared. 

It was 2021 and their revenue was skyrocketing. NRR was super high. 

They were fat and happy and didn’t want the meal I was offering. 

“What does little agency boy know anyway?” They thought. 

One of those vendors even sent me a threat of litigation for trying to help them. 

So what was the problem? 

None of their customers were using the product or getting value from it. 

It wasn't operationalized properly in Salesforce. 

Their customers’ executive teams weren’t aligned on an ABM strategy

BDRs barely used the intent company-level data, if at all. 

Their customers were paying $100k+/year for software and all they were doing was running like $5k/month of display advertising through it.  

I saw this pattern 50+ times in 2021.

Now, it sounds like their churn is through the roof. That’s the pattern I’ve seen consulting with 100+ companies in the past 18 months, at least. There’s other data that supports this. 

So I’ll tell all of you the same strategy lessons and insights I tried to tell them 4 years ago: 

1. You *NEED* to offer Strategic Professional Services if you sell a software solution that requires executive transformational change.

A Customer Success Manager (CSM) ain’t gonna cut it when the long-term success of your product relies on multiple Executives changing their mindset and operating framework and aligning on new metrics & objectives. 

You must bring high-value, expert consulting that helps your customers’ leadership team make the transformations required to have success with your product. 

2. You *NEED* to properly Operationalize your solution within the tech stack. 

Outsourcing the true technical implementation of your product to an agency, or worse, leaving it up to your customers' internal Ops team to figure out, is a clear losing strategy. 

Most legacy SaaS companies won’t do it because their investors expect 80+% gross margin and this would compromise it. But you’ll pay for it later in GRR % which is a ton more costly and painful. 

3. You can’t just sell a product and collect your MRR anymore. You *NEED* to do whatever it takes to get your customer the RESULTS you promise them. 

Tech buyers now constantly need to measure and communicate the ROI of their investments (in technology and everything else) - this is incredibly different than it was in 2021. Back then, CMOs could buy an ABM technology and barely use it just so they could be part of the Cool Kids Club. 

Now, if you aren’t getting your customers REAL RESULTS and helping them communicate the ROI and impact of your solution, you will be incredibly vulnerable.

"Just like every B2B company ran Hubspot’s SEO content strategy in 2017, every B2B company should be running this dark social content strategy in 2024 👇 

1. Host a weekly live event where you provide free consulting, advice, or information to your target customers (current & prospective).

2. Convert the recording of that live event to a long-form podcast (Apple Podcast, Spotify) and long-form video podcast (YouTube, Website). 

3. Cut the long-form video for micro-content for social media platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube shorts, Tik Tok, Facebook Reels, etc.)

4. Monitor performance of organic social media posts, and used paid LinkedIn to amplify your best performing posts to your target account list (Tier 1, Tier 2, or both). 

5. Collect quantitative & qualitative insights from all of these activities (Event chat, social media comments, dark social feedback, etc.) that drives future topics & ideas for the next event. 

6. Measure success against Total Pipeline generated and Blended Marketing ROI. 

7. Repeat, Learn, Iterate. 

___

The way B2B buyers research, discover, evaluate, and purchase products has fundamentally shifted. 

Having a presence and strategy for dark social content is no longer optional. It’s required. 

If you aren’t doing it, you’re missing a lot of opportunity and becoming increasingly vulnerable to competitors that move on it.

High-performing Marketing teams get 10X more revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing, compared to low performers*. 

High performers: $3 in revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing.

Low performers: $0.30 in revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. 

A core difference? Almost all high performers have a powerful dark social content strategy they've invested in for a long period of time.

"Here’s the roadmap for the first 90 days as a Marketing leader:

1. Quantitative Business Analysis 

-Identify all the places where marketing investments are objectively wasting money (hint: it’s a lot). Give the money back to the company to hit the bottom line or re-allocate to marketing programs that are already clearly working and have scale potential. 

-Close all data & attribution gaps so you have a clean objective view of performance moving forward & start collecting initial data ASAP. Includes things like self-reported attribution, UTM tracking for performance marketing, and full lifecycle tracking using a custom object. 

2. Qualitative Customer Analysis 

-Run qualitative customer interviews with your 10 best customers and 10 worst customers. Identify the nuances in demographics & psychographics. Develop hypotheses. Adjust segmentation strategy. 

-Test the updated segmentation model yourself by running 10+ qualitative customer interviews with *prospective* customers. 

3. Figure out how to drive more revenue within the first 90 days with pipeline acceleration and demand capture (hint: it’s definitely not high volume lead gen) 

-Optimize the messaging & conversion path on the homepage of your website

-Optimize the handoff process so more customers that request a demo actually sit on a demo (crazy that only ~30% of SaaS prospective customers that ask for a demo actually sit on one - so much waste!)

-Build customer stories and/or a reference list to enable Sales to close late stage deals faster and at a higher rate. 

-Run pipeline acceleration events with Sales for key late stage deals 

____

Lots of early stage companies think they need their marketing leader to go out and get tons of MQLs in the first 30 days. This is effectively always a failure and will set you back 3-6 months while losing a lot of credibility in the company. 

These activities like customer research, segmentation, funnel optimization, and sales enablement set the foundation to then go out and CREATE DEMAND in the second/third quarter as a CMO by launching a podcast, organic social content, evangelism, paid social, influencer marketing, etc. 

Set the right order of operations first. Then set the right expectations on what metrics you’re moving and on what timeline. 

1. Customer Insights, Segmentation, and Targeting 
2. Convert More Pipeline

4. Create More Demand

"We just finished an analysis of $14MM per year spent on global Google paid search campaigns and here are the results:

Spend: $14,240,000
Opportunities Created: 1,212
Cost/Opp: $11,749
Advertising CAC Payback (Includes Google Ads Expenses): 23 Months 
Marketing CAC Payback (Include All Other Marketing Expenses): 58 Months
Total CAC Payback (Includes Sales & SDR Expenses): 116 Months 

When it's all said and done with all the costs across their entire GTM, it will take almost 10 YEARS to pay back the cost of acquiring a customer via Google Ads. 

The best campaign? Branded search. $3MM per year. 49 Month total CAC payback. 

-> Branded campaigns should ALWAYS have an Ad CAC payback period less than 2 months and a total CAC payback period less than 6 months. 

The worst campaign? Non-branded search campaign. $3.6MM per year. 193 Month Total CAC payback. 

-> Non-branded campaigns should ALWAYS have an Ad CAC payback period less than 12 months and a total CAC payback period less than 36 months. 

___

We were surprised by the results and wanted to check our work. So we used 4 different attribution models to analyze the spend. The above results are from the **most generous** attribution model. 

It’s wild for sure, but these types of results aren’t atypical in the analyses we do with companies spending more than $5MM per year on Google Ads. 

Here are some tips to scrutinize the spend properly:

1. Measure your results against REVENUE, not just opportunity count or “pipeline” 

2. Scrutinize each individual campaign, especially breaking out results between Branded vs. Non-Branded campaigns 

3. Calculate CAC in 3 dimensions (Ad CAC, Marketing CAC, and Total CAC) 

4. You need to have the discipline to shut off campaigns that do not achieve the appropriate ROI and reallocate the spend to other programs/channels that do. 

___

Google paid search is often by far the largest expense across the entire Marketing budget and simultaneously the lowest performing investment. 

It boggles my mind that CFOs and CEOs are not putting more scrutiny on these massive Marketing expenditures.

"After a thorough analysis of a $80MM ARR SaaS company, I just recommended an 88% budget cut to Google Ads heading into a H2. Resulting in a $1.7MM annualized savings to be reallocated to higher performing programs. Here’s why:

BACKGROUND

1. Company had been spending $2MM per year on Google Ads (12% branded, 88% non-brand / competitor. 

2. CAC payback period on non-branded and competitive terms were > 5 years in both a W-shaped (generous) model and a conversion-only (strict) model. 

3. Total company pipeline production has dropped by 50% over the past 3 quarters. And Sales win rates have dropped from 16% to 10%. 

4. Current strategy to create pipeline is insufficient to hit the FY24 revenue plan and already has the FY25 growth plan at risk. 

5. Changing nothing will result in < 15% YoY growth in both FY24 and FY25. 

RATIONALE

At Passetto, we are *consistently* recommending major (> 75%) cuts to Google Ads / Paid Search investments for the following core reasons:

1. The unit economics simply don’t make sense in most cases for a complex B2B sales motion. 

Sure, you can get this channel to seemingly work when you measure it on ""cost per conversion"" or ""cost per MQL"" but the conversion rates from that point forward are awful and full funnel conversion is required to estimate true ROI. 

Cost per click = $18
Landing page conversion rate = 1% 
Conversion to Qualified Opp: 30%
Conversion to Closed Won: 12% 

Click to Closed Won = 0.04% (1 closed won for every 2,500 clicks)
Direct Advertising CAC: $50,000
Program CAC: $72,000 (estimate)
Marketing CAC: > $100,000 
Total CAC (Marketing, Sales, SDR, Ops, etc.): > $200,000 

Blended CAC payback at $40k ACV = More than 5 years. 

2. Poor unit economics on Google Ads + significant investment allocation (>25% of total budget) put massive pressure on aggregated unit economics - Marketing ROI and Total CAC. 

3. No account-level targeting on Google Ads. You can’t guarantee that the people clicking your ads for $18 per click are even qualified to buy from you (lots of Google Ads traffic and conversions are Spam or unqualified SMB). 

We instead recommended reallocating this budget to LinkedIn Ads, Meta Ads, YouTube, and Connected TV where the targeting capabilities are significantly more accurate and sophisticated so we know the advertising investments are going towards people and accounts that can actually buy from us. 

_____

People follow me on LinkedIn because I see insights, patterns, and trends in real-life years before they become mainstream. Well this one could make a massive difference for you over the next 18 months:

Divest from a majority of Google Ad spend and reallocate to drive more pipeline production and better overall ROI against your go-to-market spend. 

The data is blindly obvious. If CMOs aren't pushing it, it's time for CEOs and CFOs to apply pressure here.

"B2B Companies have been talking about Sales & Marketing misalignment for more than a decade. They’ve tried to solve it with:

-Changing marketing goals from MQLs to SQLs (didn’t work)
-Putting a Chief Revenue Officer in charge of Marketing (didn’t work)
-Having a weekly pipeline meeting (didn’t work)
-Buying an ABM platform (didn’t work)

B2B companies always try to fix GTM at tactical execution (let’s hire a new growth marketer to do SEO for us) or tech & tools (let’s buy an ABM platform and change from MQLs to MQAs).

They do this because it’s easy but doesn’t solve the real problem. It’s superficial & visible. It’s easy to report back to the board in a powerpoint slide about a new tool or tactic.

But the real root cause of these issues is much more fundamental. It’s deeply rooted & invisible.

The real root cause is the operating model & data model that companies consciously or subconsciously adopt that drives the mindset of executives, investors, and GTM teams, and influences every decision they make.

Lead -> MQL/MQA -> SAL -> SQL -> SQO -> Closed Won

And here are the core issues:

1. Operates in an assembly line of silo’d departments instead of an allbound integrated revenue team.

2. Evaluation of the ROI and Impact of investments are made in silos by each department (Marketing, Sales, SDRs) instead of within a Unified GTM model.

3. There are no commonly accepted KPIs and ""attribution"" strategies for Demand Creation, so the entire GTM team doesn't focus or invest here, leaving the entire GTM engine highly imbalanced & inefficient.

4. Most companies use a model that was created between 2012 and 2017, despite how much has changed in the world in the past 6 years.

5. Marketing is optimizing for MQLs/MQAs or a poor definition of “pipeline” that doesn’t align to close won revenue. The data is clear in every Salesforce instance that core Marketing KPIs don’t align to closed won revenue, sales velocity, and marketing ROI.

6. SDRs optimize for SQLs or meetings, not closed won revenue.

7. Revenue planning models look great in a spreadsheet & break in real life.

8. All of the technology, tools, and tactical “best practices” are built around getting leads, MQLs/MQAs, and SQLs, further entrenching companies getting stuck in the model.

9. GTM teams are stuck in the incremental. How do we improve our outbound connect rates by 1%? How do we reduce our cost per lead by $3? There are no breakthroughs in growth with incremental improvements. Optimizing a broken model is not the solution, it’s changing the model.

10. No standardized data model so every company reinvents the wheel in RevOps w/o clear, performance-based definitions. Everybody on the GTM team is looking at different metrics.

When you are making adjustments for H2 2024, use these ideas as a guide. Clearly identify the core issue(s) that are holding you back. Create a solution that actually solves the root cause, instead of treating the symptoms.

"7 Trends for B2B Marketing in 2025 that should happen but probably won’t:

1. Smaller Internal W2 Fixed Cost Marketing Teams 

We will see more 10-person Marketing teams at $100MM ARR than we will 100-person teams that many are accustomed to. Tons of management layers, reporting workflows, and inflated overhead costs that actually slow you down.

2. Senior leaders will get back into Execution.

No more sitting in Ivory towers with 4 management layers between Strategy and Execution. Smaller teams means senior leaders are in the execution, close to customers, and learn how to use AI to exponentially increase their productivity.

3. Greater usage of Offshoring & AI (more flexible, less costly)

Low level executional roles like video editing, graphic design, (potentially) paid media execution, email prospecting, etc. will be executed by AI and operated/managed by 1 expert in the craft.

4. Greater usage of External experts that bring process, data & automation that augments internal staff & builds competitive advantages.

For almost a decade, B2B companies have taken pride in trying to do everything in-house (see Point 1 above). And they miss out on amazing process, data, automation, insights, and expertise from external experts that simply cannot be replicated in-house.

5. Greater investment and weighted budgeting to program dollars and less to W2 headcount.

The typical budget allocation is 55/45 Programs to Headcount investment in the Marketing budget. Over time, we will see that more weighted to 75/25 Programs to Headcount as companies get more efficient on Headcount strategy, implement AI and offshoring. 

This adjustment creates meaningfully more flexibility for the Revenue Factory.

6. CMOs that don’t own the Prospecting machine (e.g. BDRs) are at a severe disadvantage

It’s true. Process efficiency & alignment matter. If your BDRs & Marketing team spend most of the time debating “Inbound” vs. “Outbound”, you are almost guaranteed to miss your targets.

7. CMOs that aren’t intently focused on unit economics & ROI will be fired by Mid-2026

Boards are about to put the hammer down on Marketing. If they haven't already. CMOs that communicate a clear, simple, financially-driven story to the board around performance, opportunities and future plans will succeed. Those that continue to present “marketing sourced revenue reports” , “number of MQLs or demo requests”, “influenced revenue reports” and over-complicated, unhelpful touchpoint data won’t have their job in 12 months.

PE investments that invested 2021-2022 have 2-3 more years left on the hold and they aren’t happy with the current return profile. Growth needs to accelerate and CAC needs to go down big time to get the exit multiple they want.

__

Everything changed in 2022-2023. Most of the traditional Marketing playbook for a CMO is now set up to get you fired, not rewarded. 

It's a new era for CMOs. Are you stuck in the past or paving the way forward?

"This is the most important video I’ll put out all year 💡 

I sit in meetings where B2B companies waste tens of thousands of hours each year (literally) debating which attribution model. Or not making any important strategic changes because they can’t agree on an attribution and planning model. 

Their Pipeline Problem, driven by declining ROI and performance on Marketing & SDR investments, is costing them at least $50MM per quarter. 

And instead of fixing the real problem and creating massive value, we sit and debate changing from first touch to last touch for 6 months and end up changing nothing. 

Internally at the company, they don’t see it. 

But from the outside working with 50+ companies this year, it’s obvious to me that the way B2B companies use this attribution system is the *cause* of their Pipeline Problem, not the solution. 

Every B2B company is trying to build a “Four Funnel” attribution model to divide credit between Marketing, SDRs, Partner, and Sales. And it’s literally the worst way to plan, measure, and optimize your GTM in 2024 and beyond. 

Because Marketing, SDRs, and Partners all have different superpowers and objectives in business and revenue generation. So why in the World would we measure them all the same? Make it make sense!! 😭 😭 

This model pushes every department to focus on the same, small part of the customer journey where lead origination source is tracked. Aka everyone is fighting over trackable attribution instead of operating as a Unified Revenue Factory. 

Your GTM strategy and tens of millions of dollars in investments get built to appease the attribution model, not the other way around. 

It’s an incredibly simplistic financial model. That worked great in 2021 when you had massive market tailwinds, and everyone’s coming in to buy your stuff, and NRR is through the roof, and none of your investors care about unit economics. 

The “Four Funnel” model works great to just divide the credit dy department and pour millions of dollars more in. 

But when you need to be intentional about your investments and achieve proper unit economics to scale, this model fundamentally breaks. 

Which is why I personally recommended this approach from 2018-2022 and I’m forcefully pushing against it now. 

Because I understand this model deeply, I know its flaws, and I know it will not work in today’s environment. And we’re never going back to the way it used to be. 

If you try to use this model to scale your company to $100MM+ ARR, you will inevitably run into painful, expensive unit economics problems that will slow down your growth path by multiple years.

"“We don’t use agencies or consultants because I had a bad experience with one several years ago”. That’s what a Director of RevOps told me yesterday. 

It’s like saying you’re never going to a restaurant again because one time you had a bad meal. 

I used to think the same way when I was young, naive and inexperienced. I took so much pride in thinking I knew everything and could do it all myself. 

But then in 2013, despite me arguing against it, the company I worked for hired a Strategic Marketing Consultant named Andy and it fundamentally changed my career. 

Andy taught me all the really important things about Marketing that most people don’t talk about - how to conduct customer interviews, how to create a business case, how to run a beta trial, how to build a differentiated strategy using product, price, distribution, and promotion all together. 

Then again in 2017, the company I worked for hired a Category Design Consultant named Robin who taught me everything about category design, positioning, narrative design and strategic communications. 

Then again in 2018, the company I worked for hired a Creative & Branding agency who totally transformed our website, sales decks, and advertising assets and taught me everything I know about the creative process and how much it matters in properly communicating your message to the market. 

A lot of my skills, experience, and success in entrepreneurship can be directly attributed to these experiences working with external experts that taught me specialized knowledge, processes, and ways of thinking. 

___

External experts (agencies, consultants, fractionals, etc.) have distinct advantages that simply can’t be replicated by in-house employees:

-They’ve worked with hundreds or thousands of companies to solve the same problem 
-They’ve developed processes, automation, and other forms of intellectual property that accelerate projects and initiatives 
-They’ve seen some companies succeed and clearly know what ""success"" looks like and what it takes
-They've seen many companies fail and know how to help you avoid common mistakes and missteps. 

Not leveraging external experts to complement the skills of your in-house team, accelerate key strategic initiatives, avoid common missteps, and help you identify internal blindspots is simply not smart and is based on a false sense of ego and pride.

I know because I thought that way for a long time and now realize how naive and misguided my thinking was. 

Not using external experts just because you had one bad experience with one is like saying you’re never going to a restaurant again because you had one bad meal. 

Restaurants don’t all suck - you just picked a bad one. 

Pick a better restaurant next time. Or be naive and prideful trying to cook all the meals by yourself - eat a bunch of poorly cooked meals, have it take 10x longer, and waste a bunch of time and money trying to be a self-taught Michelin Star Chef.

"I hear the grumblings - many people think I’m trying to “put Marketing down” but in reality I’m one of the only people trying to save this profession. 

The B2B Marketing profession will slowly die if this doesn’t change. It’s already happening. 

-Lots of PE firms telling me they are broadly disappointed with Marketing performance and the business acumen within that department

-Lots of CROs telling me they don’t have confidence their Marketing team can fix the pipeline problem.

-Lots of CEOs needing to make changes to Marketing leadership due to continued underperformance (inadequate unit economics that don't scale)

-Revenue Marketing / Demand Gen / ABX is starting to roll into the Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). Some CMOs are trying to give this away from their mandate and focus only on Product Marketing & Comms. 

-Product Marketing teams are starting to roll into Product or Strategy, instead of Marketing. 

Don’t shoot the messenger. 

These are facts about what’s happening, not my opinion. 

You can get mad at me for telling you the truth, or you can use this information to your advantage. 

___

Unfortunately, just changing who owns the responsibilities that Marketing currently owns isn’t going to fix this problem. It's just yet another superficial band-aid B2B companies use to patch up this problem for a few quarters until the dysfunction resurfaces again. 

___

B2B companies continue to spin around in a circle

1. Hire a New CMO
2. Get measured on the wrong things
3. Do the wrong things
4. Don’t have a story to tell around business impact because there isn’t one
5. CMO asked to resign
6. Repeat every 18 months 

Change how you measure the success of your CMO and magically Marketing strategy changes and the impact of Marketing investments increase dramatically. Smart people can achieve clear goals. 

The person in the seat (CMO) isn’t the problem. The process of how we plan, measure, and optimize our Pipeline Creation process is the real problem. 

Stop wasting your time hiring a new CMO that will be set up to fail and FIX THE REAL PROBLEM.

"Pipeline is the #1 issue for a majority of B2B Companies but most Execs don't understand the true root cause:

The Marketing KPIs are not aligned to Business Results. 

__

People on LinkedIn put creativity on a pedestal, but B2B Marketing is the antithesis of Creative. 

B2B Marketing has spent the last 10-15 years running the same outdated, ineffective playbook of:

-Build PDF e-books that hide behind forms
-Run 7-step generic email nurtures
-Scale SDR farms to manage the spam cannons
-Spend millions per year on Google Ads w/o justifiable ROI
-Build 10+ over-priced ineffective trade show booths per year

And here’s why it happens:

Because the way B2B Marketing has been measured has not changed in the past 10-15 years either.

It’s built around “Leads” and “Web Traffic” and “Influenced Revenue Reporting” instead of actual business results. And there are no proper targets for achieving scalable unit economics. 

This misalignment between Marketing Metrics and Business Results boxes in Marketing to a very narrow set of traditional tactics, and is the OPPOSITE of Creativity. 

Want to help your Marketing team be dramatically more Creative? Here’s how:

1. Track Your Current Marketing Metrics and (New) Business Level Metrics Simultaneously. 

2. Prove to Yourself and other Execs that the Business Level Metrics are much better indicators of Marketing success 

3. Shift Marketing accountability from BS to BUSINESS RESULTS. (1) ROI of Create Pipeline Investments, (2) New Logo Efficiency %, (3) Growth Rate 

4. Empower your Marketing team to execute activities that drive the highest ROI (Pipeline & Revenue per $ spent, regardless of attribution). 

5. Leverage attribution and other forms of custom analytics as *secondary* forms of measurement and data to optimize the strategy & investments. 

__

It should be *impossible* for Marketing to hit their targets 2-3 quarters in a row while Sales misses quota and the Company misses growth targets. 

Yet, it literally happens all the time. 

And B2B companies try to fix it with band-aid solutions like:

-Have a CRO-CMO weekly coffee meeting. 
-Change National Sales Meeting to ""Revenue Kickoff""
-Have a Pipeline meeting on Wednesdays. 
-Spend 6 months to build a new attribution system in the CRM
-Try a bunch of random stuff that doesn’t solve the problem. 

But the only real solution is to fix the Marketing KPIs, so they are perfectly aligned to business results. 

If Pipeline Creation is the biggest opportunity in your business (and for many, it definitely is), make sure you fix the real problem!

"What if someone offered you $500 a day to sit in a room filled with a virus?
Would you do it?

What if they added:

-0.05% equity
-10 vacation days
-One offsite in Florida

Of course not.

But that’s basically what it’s like to work inside a low-frequency company for $180,000 a year.

The infection just spreads differently.

You don’t catch it through the air.
You catch it through meetings, Slack threads, and investor updates.

You start to absorb it:

-The urgency
-The pressure
-The anxiety
-The constant feeling of not being enough

It spreads on three levels:

Biological: Your body syncs with the stress signals around you.

Behavioral: You mirror the worldviews, emotions, and habits of your environment.

Cultural: The group creates a shared baseline of scarcity, urgency, and pressure.

That’s how calm, capable people burn out in a year.
They don’t change overnight. They just adapt to the frequency of the company.

This is a flow of energy that infects the entire ecosystem: 

It starts at the cap table.
Extractive capital pushes for fast growth and quick returns.
The CEO and leaders absorb the pressure.
It flows down to teams who carry it forward.
Vendors, partners, and customers feel it next.

Soon everyone is operating from stress, scarcity, and survival while pretending it’s normal.

It's become ""normal"" in tech for people to feel this way.
But this is NOT normal.
It's a virus most people don't see (yet).

If you're tired, anxious, or restless even when things look fine on paper, this is why.

You're absorbing the frequency of your work environment, the one you spend most of your life in.

And the cost is far bigger than your paycheck.
It carries with you to your health, well-being, relationships, creativity, confidence, and everything in your life. 

It won't be long until all the best talent flows to high-frequency companies. 

High-frequency companies prioritize impact over external validation. Calm over anxiety. Clarity over urgency. Regeneration over extraction. Originality over comparison. Sustainability over speed. 

They energize and empower everyone (investors, leaders, employees, customers, vendors, partners) in the ecosystem. 

Once top talent feels what it's like to work in a high-frequency environment, they will NEVER work at a low-frequency company again. 

They will become ALLERGIC. And see it for what it really is - Like sitting in a room filled with a virus for $500/day. 

The future belongs to high-frequency companies.

"CEOs and CROs know they have a “Pipeline Problem” but they don’t realize it’s costing them more than $50MM every quarter they don’t fix it. 

At $50MM ARR and $15MM per year on Marketing & BDRs (simplification of the core investments to Create Pipeline):

1. [Root Cause] Pipeline Creation ROI drops by 50% from 1Q23 to 3Q24. 

2. [Growth Rate Slows] New Logo revenue growth slows by approximately $5MM/year and slows growth by 9% 

3. [GTM Efficiency Up to > 250%] Cut costs to lower CAC, but CAC is still up by close to 2X 

These combined factors of Growth Rate, GTM Efficiency, and Profitability create a minimum EV difference of 5X revenue multiple = $250MM per year in Enterprise Value. 

Every quarter it doesn’t get fixed, it costs Shareholders and Investors at least $50MM. And delays the time horizon for the compounding power of a SaaS business. 

—

And why is it happening? Because B2B companies don’t have a proper Pipeline Creation Methodology. On a $15MM per year budget to Create Pipeline, they have:

-Team of 30 Marketers
-Team of 20 SDRs
-$6MM per year in Marketing programs 

And no clear methodology to Create Pipeline at an appropriate Unit Economics.

So they fall back on the Lead Gen Waterfall from 2012, except now they break it down by which department sourced the lead....

Installing a “Four Funnel” model that divides lead source credit between Sales, Marketing, SDRs, and Partners was an appropriate strategy that I personally recommended in 2018-2022.

"Who owns GTM?

This heavily debated topic is now crystal clear.

1. If Marketing reports to the CEO, then the CEO owns GTM by default. 

2. If a CRO owns Marketing, Sales, and Expansion/Renewal, then the CRO owns GTM. 

Those are the only 2 real options from my perspective. 

So what’s the insight? 

Most CEOs and CROs don’t know how to properly judge, analyze, optimize and scale Pipeline Creation (Marketing + SDRs), especially when there is so much pressure on unit economics. 

This blindspot can slow growth, increase CAC, and decimate shareholder value during the Growth and Scale Up phase. 

__

If you want to build your GTM and steer your ship to an eventual IPO or Exit, the first thing you need to do is figure out exactly where you are right now. 

CEOs & CROs know they’re in North America. 

But they need to know that they’re in Austin, TX on the corner of 6th and Colorado looking south-west.  

They need to precisely know the performance of their Revenue Factory so they can properly align GTM teams, strategic initiatives, and investment allocation to drive the company forward and maximize shareholder value. 

Right now CEOs & CROs sit through a 5 hour board meeting and 120-slide Marketing, Sales, and SDR decks and still don’t really know what's going on. 

It’s filled with a bunch of data and reports and zero executive-level strategic insights. 

Their only reference point is their own internal goals & planning or what their board/investors say. 

They are missing a *critical* external perspective that helps them see the bigger picture, calibrate and contextualize their performance, and align their GTM teams and investments. 

The only person who can fix your Revenue Factory is the person who has full ownership of GTM. Most of the time, that is the CEO. 

Once you recognize this reality, it’s extremely powerful.

"The Gartner 2024 CMO Spend Survey. Here’s the breakdown and what you need to know 👇 

BACKGROUND

1. Gartner collected a *survey* of 395 CMOs and Marketing leaders about their budgets in 2024 compared to 2023 (conducted in Q1 2024).

2. Survey respondents were from 11 different countries across 10 major industries, including financial services, high tech, manufacturing, healthcare, travel, etc.

3. Median annual revenue from respondents was $5.3 BILLION

4. Respondents were 43% B2B, 21% B2C, and 36% blended B2B and B2C.

KEY FINDINGS

1. In the surveyed sample, Marketing budgets fell by 15% from 2023 to 2024 from 9.1% of total company revenue down to 7.7%.

2. In the survey sample, Marketing allocations changed from 2023 to 2024 with companies spending more on Marketing Programs as a % of total marketing budget, and less on MarTech, Agencies, and Headcount.

3. The publication uses this data to support the narrative of CMOs in the “Do More with Less Era”

AND HERE’S MY TAKE

1. Median annual revenue of $5.3 Billion. 

If you are less than $1B-$2B in revenue, this data is not relevant to you.

2. The data from Gartner is collected from **survey responses**.

It’s highly unlikely the respondents are pulling out their $5B+ P&L from last year, analyzing every line item, properly categorizing each expense, and reporting it accurately on a SurveyMonkey. This data is not standardized, not validated, and not trustworthy from my perspective.

3. Budgeting and benchmarking your Marketing budget as a % of total company revenue is a lazy, inaccurate way to determine how much you should spend on Marketing.

This lazy calculation does not include critical factors such as (1) YoY Revenue Growth Rate, (2) Gross Margin, (3) EBITDA / FCF, (4) S&M % of Net New ARR, (5) NRR %, (6) Sales:Marketing spend ratio.

4. The reported budget allocations are wildly different than what we see at Passetto in our full third-party budget analyses of more than 60 middle-market B2B tech companies in the past 12 months.

Internal Headcount: Garter reports 22%. Passetto typically sees 35%-50%
Programs / Media: Gartner reports 28%. Passetto typically sees 45%-60%
Agencies: Gartner reports 22%. Passetto typically sees 4-8%
MarTech: Gartner reports 24%. Passetto typically sees 2-5%

5. The Marketing needs to “Do More With Less Era” is a toxic narrative and flat-out wrong.

Broadly, the budgets supplied to Marketing in 2024 are sufficient to achieve the tempered business growth goals. The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS.

CMOs and Marketing leaders need to completely rethink how to deploy budgets to achieve a CAC target that’s acceptable to the business.

It’s 100% possible. Companies did it for decades before the COVID-Boom and subsequent COVID-Fallout where budgets inflated & CAC payback periods increased by more than 100% from 2021-2024.

It's time to stop complaining ""we don't have enough budget"" and get back to core business fundamentals.

"CMO/CRO Average Tenure is 17 months

Average Sales quota attainment is ~40% 

Up to 70% of CEOs don’t believe their Marketing team demonstrates objective commercial thinking

Growth Rate has slowed by a median 50%

Median CAC is close to 2X higher than it was in 2021

Is it because all these people suck at their jobs now? No. It’s obviously not. 

It’s NOT A TALENT PROBLEM. 

It’s tough to see this reality when you work inside one company.

I have the privilege of working with 50+ companies per year, with all their CRM and Financial data. So I have lots of confidential conversations & see clear patterns that happen across most orgs that most people would never see. 

Which gives me a unique perspective on the real problem. So here it is:

The way companies plan, measure, and optimize their GTM performance and investments set the GTM Leadership and GTM Teams up to fail.

Read that again.

This is a cross-functional executive and board-level *process* problem, not a talent problem. 

It’s bigger than any individual C-Level Executive or Department. Here’s why:

-The Operating Model (e.g. Demand Waterfall, Four Funnel, Double Funnel, etc.) that are overly simplistic, lack practical application and don't account or optimize for unit economics

-The CRM Data Architecture - Companies take this Operating Model & build a homegrown implementation in the CRM using fragmented data & objects across different departments. So there’s no aligned data strategy across the entire company (it’s true).

-The Financial Data Architecture - The only way expenses are tagged are by GL Code. There is no integrated strategy to optimize for unit economics across the customer lifecycle (No wonder Median CAC is up 2X!) 

-C-Level KPIs - There's often no accountability to a unit economics target at the “top of the funnel”, meaning the massive investments in Marketing business development aren't aligned to business performance (No wonder CMO Tenure is 17 Months, they’re set up to fail with misaligned goals)

-Lack of Centralized Integrated Alignment Process - The Operating Model, company culture, poor data architecture & GTM Planning Model create and facilitate a Decentralized Department Silo’d style of management & operations that lack the coordination required to drive faster growth & better GTM efficiency.

-GTM Operating & Planning Model - The Operating Model built to try to divide the credit by which Department “sourced” the lead has not evolved since the early 2010’s and clearly misaligns the GTM teams. Downstream, it drives overly-simplistic, inaccurate “ROI” calculations by Finance. This planning model gives you ZERO visibility on how to optimize and scale.

____

CEOs - When all of these critical business workflows are not aligned into a highly effective process, you will get poor results and then (often) blame it on talent instead of yourself. 

Are you starting to see why the only people who can fix this are the board and the CEO?

"Measuring ""Inbound"" vs. ""Outbound"" is probably the #1 reason you're missing your Growth targets. 

Why? Here it is 👇 

Eventually, you’ll run into unit economics challenges and data visibility challenges where you don’t know what to do with your Marketing and SDRs to keep scaling them. 

^^I’ve talked to more than 100 CEOs & CFOs that express this exact challenge

And here are the problems that come from this old, outdated ineffective way of pipeline measurement & department accountability:

1. Marketing - Forces all Marketing investments into a small part of the Revenue generation process called “lead capture”. 

-Complete imbalance of Marketing investments caused by the singular attribution model leads to massive diminishing returns where B2B companies way overspend on low quality lead generation 
-Improper measurement of Marketing investments make it incredibly complicated and subjective as to whether Marketing is performing at the level required for business scalability. 

*You should be able to know how well your Marketing is working or not with 2 metrics. 
*Marketing performance should be measured on a spectrum. *How well is it working*. It’s not binary. 

2. SDRs - No visibility to confidently scale or optimize the Prospecting process. 

-The only thing tracked is who books the meeting. But nothing about the WHY and HOW did we win
-The “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” planning and debate distracts everyone from the insights needed for scaling and optimizing Sales Development process

3. Sales - Sales sits at the bottom of the funnel and doesn’t have enough pipeline coverage to hit plan. 

-Lower quota attainment, lower PRP, forces Sales headcount adjustments 
-Sales starts doing prospecting and lead generation to make up for poor performance at the top of the funnel and creates an *unscalable* GTM motion with untenable unit economics. 

4. Finance - Poor financial performance and ZERO clarity on what to do to fix it. 

-Slowed growth, increased CAC, lower profitability, lower enterprise value 
-Strategic decisions are made based on someone’s opinion (e.g. CMO or CRO) instead of confidently based on data. 

___

“Inbound” was a Tech Vendor’s (Hubspot) Marketing message in 2013. And somehow 11 years later, it’s still considered a “best practice” across B2B. 

Meanwhile, the “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” aka Marketing vs. SDRs. vs. Sales vs. Partner Lead-source origination attribution model that’s widely adopted across B2B is the primary cause of unscalable unit economics and data visibility challenges. 

Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing all your GTM teams on lead source origination - a singular, totally sub-optimal attribution & planning model. 

Start planning, measuring and optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

"I talked to 100+ SaaS executives at the Pavilion GTM 2024 conference and here was my #1 takeaway:

~75% of CROs and CEOs know Pipeline is the #1 problem in their Revenue Factory. 

And here are the unspoken undertones:

1. CROs & CEOs don’t have the data to diagnose & fix their pipeline problem. 

2. CROs & CEOs don’t have the expertise to strategize and manage Pipeline Creation the same way they do with Sales process/forecasting. 

3. CROs & CEOs don’t have confidence that their CMO can solve it. 

And when you break down the department-level silo’s and analytics, the TARGET is simple:

For our Revenue Factory to deliver proper unit economics with less than 150% New Logo GTM Efficiency....

We need to deliver $2 in REVENUE for every $1 invested to Create Pipeline (majority of expenses are Marketing, SDRs, Tech/Admin)....

Then add in Sales headcount, operations, commissions, etc. and you still land at or under an 18-month New Logo CAC payback period. 

__

So for a $20MM investment in Creating Pipeline, you need:

$200MM in Pipeline at a projected 10% win rate 

$80MM in Pipeline at a projected 25% win rate. 

But when your Pipeline Creation process in the Revenue Factory is inefficient, you don’t get the appropriate ROI on all of these combined investments. 

So instead of getting $200MM in Pipeline at a 10% win rate, you get $50MM. 

Instead of getting $80MM in Pipeline at a 25% win rate, you get $20MM. 

You miss out on $100MM+ in Pipeline each year, $10MM+ in future revenue, and hundreds of millions in Enterprise Value for founders, employees, and investors. 

And then:

-Sales is starving waiting at the bottom of the funnel with no pipeline coverage
-Your most expensive resources in the Revenue Factory (Sales) start doing low value work in other areas of the Factory (e.g. low quality prospecting)
-You miss pipeline targets by 25% up to 75% 
-PRP drops and forces Sales headcount reductions 
-CAC increases to untenable levels 

And the ONLY way to fix your Pipeline Problem is to improve the blended Unit Economics at the “top of the funnel” 

To do this, you need an INTENTIONAL plan. This metric will never improve on its own by accident. 

____

For SaaS companies > 95% NRR, fix your Pipeline Problem to achieve appropriate unit economics at the “Top of the Funnel” i.e. Pipeline Creation in the Revenue Factory…..and you become one of the most valuable private SaaS companies in terms of metrics with > 40% Growth Rate and GTM Efficiency < 200%. And command a 10-18X TTM revenue multiple instead of a 3-6X. 

(yes, that impact is usually in the $Billions ;)

___

Companies spend millions of dollars each year to implement, train, and execute against a clear Sales methodology. 

But literally do NOTHING and invest NOTHING in a clear methodology to Create Pipeline. 

^And that’s the 9-figure to 10-figure problem hiding in plain sight for most CEOs > $50MM ARR.

"This data is INSANE. And proves the “Growth at All Costs” era is over. 

Quite literally billions of dollars in enterprise value driven by how cost-efficient your go-to-market (GTM) is. Let’s check it out 👇 

First - yes, Growth matters. And has one of the largest impacts on TTM Revenue Multiple and Enterprise Value. 

But now Efficiency also matters - how much it costs to grow. Which is most heavily impacted by the ROI of the entire go-to-market GTM investment (40-60% of total revenue invested in GTM). 

__

So here’s the metric you need to monitor: GTM EFFICIENCY %

GTM Efficiency % = [TTM Total GTM Expenses] / [TTM Total Net New ARR]  * 100%

Put simply, GTM Efficiency % means how much did you spend on GTM to generate $1 in Net New ARR. 

(The smaller, the better) 

Net New ARR = New Logo + Expansion - Contraction - Churn 

Total GTM Expenses = Sales, Marketing, SDRs, Operations, Leadership, Admin, Training, Technology, Data, etc. 

But this number has been getting a lot bigger since 2021 in both the public markets and private markets. And it's decimating enterprise value in the process. 

__

So here’s the thing you need to know: SaaS companies with better GTM Efficiency are valued significantly higher (as a multiple of TTM Revenue). 

GTM Efficiency > 250% -> 3.6X median revenue multiple
GTM Efficiency 175% - 250% -> 6.4X median revenue multiple
GTM Efficiency < 175% -> 10X median revenue multiple

Wow, companies with *efficient* GTM are valued 2X-3X more than SaaS companies with demonstrably inefficient GTM. 

And that makes a difference of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to shareholders. 

CEOs, CFOs, and Investors take note!

The “Growth at All Costs” era is over. 

Drive hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in increased enterprise value in 2025 by hitting your growth target while also maintaining target GTM Efficiency < 175%.

"CEOs & CROs - Imagine if you ran your 100 person Sales team without a Sales Methodology like Challenger, MEDDIC, MEDDPICC, etc. 

You could have talented Sales reps, all the best technology in the World, and capable senior leaders.....and it would still be a total disaster. 

-You wouldn’t know what data to collect 
-You wouldn’t be able to plan and forecast the future accurately
-You wouldn’t have insights to diagnose issues or optimize investments 
-You wouldn’t have a system to hold people accountable and keep people on track 
-Your strategy would live and die simply by the talent and training of people instead of through *systems* and *data*

But a Sales Methodology becomes the foundational SYSTEM the entire Sales team runs on.

It drives what data we collect. It drives consistency in our process. It gives us data & insights to optimize. It helps us hold people accountable and keep people on track. Our entire company uses the same deal stages, data properties, terminology, etc. It creates the ORDER instead of chaos. 

No matter how good your CRO is, your 100 person Sales team would totally fail without a Sales Methodology adopted across the company. 

And here’s the wildly non-obvious insight (and why you follow me): 

ZERO B2B companies have a comprehensive Pipeline Creation Methodology. It’s a Frankenstein, homegrown system evolved from the 2012 MQL Demand Waterfall. 

You can have a super talented CMO, a great team of Marketers & BDRs, adequate budget to hit your goals, and all of the Marketing & Sales tech tools…..but if you don’t have a PIPELINE CREATION METHODOLOGY that the whole company agrees to (especially the CEO & CFO), it’s going to be total CHAOS. 

And that’s exactly what it is. Have you experienced the Marketing portion of the Board meeting at a $50MM company? Nobody is speaking the same language. Investors and executives are looking at the data through a model built in 2012. The financial metrics are off track. Everyone knows it's a pipeline problem. But nobody can figure out why or what to do about it.

You need a PIPELINE CREATION METHODOLOGY. A comprehensive system to Create Pipeline predictably, scalably and at appropriate unit economics. That everyone in the company adopts. It’s standard practice in Sales (closing deals). It will take a few years but will be standard practice for Pipeline Creation too.

It’s crystal clear the band-aid solutions of hiring a new CMO or slapping Marketing technology on the problem aren’t working.

"Smart B2B companies are FINALLY rethinking their digital advertising strategies.

Why?

Because the traditional playbook of spending $100k/month on LinkedIn ads to promote a gated e-book is clearly not working:

1. UNTENABLE ROI. CAC Payback periods > 60 months on “leads” generated from LinkedIn lead gen campaigns

2. SALES/MARKETING MISALIGNMENT. Sales teams close on average 1 out of 1,000 “leads” from a LinkedIn lead gen campaign. 

3. NO SCALABILITY. The terrible CAC and sales productivity metrics make this advertising strategy absolutely impossible to scale - you burn exponentially more money as you spend more. 

4. GTM BLOAT. The worst symptom of all. GTM costs exponentially inflate because of the low efficiency across the entire GTM engine leading to unprofitable and unsustainable performance. 

So, B2B companies really only have two options:

1. Stop spending money on LinkedIn Ads. Many companies are doing this and cutting $100k/month on LinkedIn ads and moving that money to spend even more on Google Ads. 

For most companies, this isn’t really a solution. The measurable ROI on Google Advertising is also very poor and they are already way past the point of degrading ROI on this channel. 

2. Develop a new strategy for HOW to execute LinkedIn ads. A few smart companies are doing this with massive success, yet the majority of companies can’t do this because of their outdated attribution requirements to deem ROI to a “lead”. 

__

LinkedIn advertising is the most powerful B2B marketing channel on the planet right now. You can distribute content to the exact decision makers at your target accounts for $0.03 to $0.07 each. 

It's by far the best use of variable marketing dollars compared to alternative investments like building a big tradeshow booth, spending another $100k/month on Google Ads, testing ABM display ads, or all the other large line item expenses on a marketing budget. 

Lots of companies like to blame the channel - ""LinkedIn ads don't work."" 

When in reality, they need to blame themselves - ""Our strategy for LinkedIn ads doesn't work"" 

What are you seeing with your LinkedIn ads strategy? How are you measuring success? Let's discuss 👇

"Not focusing on or being accountable to Marketing ROI is the #1 reason why I would fire a CMO. 

Because when your ROI is 2x (super low performing), you spend $10MM on Marketing & SDRs and get $20MM in pipeline. 

And when your ROI is 10x (high performing), you spend the same $10MM on Marketing & SDRs and get $100MM in pipeline. 

This difference fundamentally solves the growth challenges for a mature company. It fixes pipeline coverage, sales quota attainment, growth rate, unit economics - Everything that matters. 

But lots of CMOs don’t track it and sadly don’t care about it. 

This is why lots of CEOs, CFOs, CROs, and PE Investors everywhere are increasingly questioning and underwhelmed by the performance of the Marketing department. 

And here are the excuses you hear from CMOs that miss pipeline targets and get poor ROI from their Marketing budget: 

“Marketing takes time” 
“We need to measure the time lag” 
“We’re doing it for brand” 
“Check the multi-touch attribution report for how everything is working""
“Our Marketing investments won’t pay off until next year and 2026” 

Wrong. 

A CMO must be able to implement strategic changes to investment allocation, core KPIs, cross-functional processes, and Marketing strategy to grow pipeline, improve unit economics, and make an impact on short-term business metrics. 

And Marketing investments MUST deliver appropriate ROI in period (TTM). 

It’s the CMO’s responsibility to deploy the investments appropriately to balance the short-term and long-term return. 

#finance #gtm #gotomarket #marketing #b2b 

p.s. Lots of CMOs will say they don’t care about ROI. They deploy a $30MM/year budget, get an awful return on the investments, miss their pipeline and revenue targets by a mile. And then after a terrible 2024 performance, they plan on doing same things with the same budget for 2025 (insanity). 

Any CMO that says they don’t care about ROI should not be a C-Level executive. 

Because the “C” in CMO means you are a BUSINESS LEADER first and the way you deliver business results is through the strategic execution of Marketing. 

And FWIW….. Growth = Investment x ROI ;) 

So you have two options: 

1. Keep increasing the budget with terrible unit economics until the model breaks and your company is worth less than the amount of money you’ve raised. 
2. Keep the budget the same (or lower) and improve the blended ROI of all of the investments.

"Measuring the ROI of an individual piece of content (like this LinkedIn video, for instance) is not only a huge waste of time, it’s flat out not accurate. 

Here’s what to do instead:

1. When it comes to “ROI”, focus on measuring the ROI of the *channel* instead of each individual piece of content. 

You don’t attribute the “ROI” of your results at the gym all to that 1 set of biceps curls you did 3 months ago. It makes no sense. But that’s effectively what B2B marketers try to do with content. 

Instead, recognize that the impact is based on the *accumulation* of consistent high quality activities executed over a sustained period of time. 

It’s easy to see that it’s more appropriate to attribute the “ROI” of your bicep results to all of the sets of bicep curls you’ve done in life, instead of a single set. 

You can do the same when measuring the success of content - measure the “ROI” based on the channel/activity. 

For create demand channels, use self-reported attribution. 
For capture demand channels, use software-based attribution. 

Using this method, we’ve attributed $7.3MM ARR to our podcast and $5.1MM ARR to LinkedIn. 

It sounds simple, because it is. 

2. THEN, when it comes to optimizing your content strategy, focus on measuring the *quality* of the activity (e.g. comments, engagement from target customers, DMs received, etc.). 

In the gym, you can measure what type of bicep curl you did, how much weight you used, and how many reps. This isn’t about attribute “ROI” but instead about measuring the *quality* of the activity. You can do the same with content:

You can read all of the comments & who wrote them (qualitative), you can listen to what people say in the DMs or on Sales calls (qualitative), you can measure engagement like “views” or “likes”. 

These signals help you optimize the activity - what topics resonate with my audience? what is the best time to post? how frequently should I post? Does video or text work better? - You get answers to important questions, but it has nothing to do with proving or measuring “ROI”. 

___

The whole mindset of measuring the “ROI” of a single piece of content persists from old thinking from the days of blogs and gated e-books in the early 2010s. That’s almost a decade ago. When people went into the office, used a desktop computer and consumed content offline in PDF format. 

Things change. 

In today’s World, it’s time to focus on the bigger picture. 

STOP trying to prove the “ROI” of each individual piece of content. 

Instead, understand that the results are built through the accumulation of tons of content & touch points over a sustained period of time. 

START measuring the “ROI” of each channel overall instead of by each individual blog or video.

"You know something is seriously wrong when a simple statement like “CMOs should care about Marketing ROI” is met with extreme resistance. 

“Blasphemy” 

“Clickbait” 

“Focusing on ROI will ruin your Marketing”

This is clearly a troublesome reality. 

Especially for CEOs, CFOs, CROs, and PE Investors who understand Finance & Business, and simultaneously recognize that the failure to deliver appropriate Marketing ROI (unit economics) is what’s stalling growth for their company. 

1. Marketing that doesn’t drive revenue - i.e. create pipeline, increase win rates, or improve retention/expansion - is just arts and crafts. 

You aren’t in Marketing to make a cool video. Or “build a brand”. Or collect a bunch of leads. These are simply intermediate steps en route to deliver the real outcome - revenue growth and enterprise value. We don’t do “Brand Marketing” because it’s cool. We do it because, when executed properly, it drives the highest ROI when appropriately balanced with shorter-term strategies and investments. 

Measuring quarterly progress on TTM Marketing ROI is the most objective way to measure this. And you should be making positive strides and continuous improvement every single quarter. 

2. This wild reaction demonstrates that some Marketers are so closed-minded, that they refuse to even consider the validity and importance of this reality. 

Measuring the ROI on your GTM investments is totally different than trying to use attribution to measure the impact of an individual investment or channel. Take a step back and consider how *Business KPIs* differ from *Marketing Attribution*. 

3. It demonstrates that a lot of Marketers don’t really understand how business & finance works. 

SaaS companies that deliver high ROI on their Sales and Marketing investments receive a median 10X TTM Revenue Multiple. While SaaS companies that deliver low ROI receive a median 3.6X TTM Revenue Multiple.

So, delivering high ROI on Sales & Marketing investments makes a potential difference of $640MM in enterprise value for your $100MM ARR company ($360MM at low ROI vs. $1B at high ROI). 

—

So, please tell me again that optimizing for appropriate ROI on Sales & Marketing investments doesn’t matter 🙂 

#finance #sales #b2b #marketing #gtm 

Any CMO that says they don’t care about ROI should not be a C-Level executive.

Because the “C” in CMO means you are a BUSINESS LEADER first and the way you deliver business results is through the strategic execution of Marketing.

Great CMOs inherently understand this. An over-titled VP usually doesn’t.

"Results from a Marketing QBR with a $200MM ARR company:

-MQLs: 147% to plan
-Stage 0 Opportunities: 103% to plan
-Qualified Pipeline Creation: 64% to plan
-Sales Quota Attainment: 52% to plan

Marketing crushes their MQL target. Sales misses quota by > 30%.

Why does this happen over and over at B2B companies? It’s simple.

Because the “MQL” marketing metric is not aligned with closed won customers.

And to hit the 4,000 quarterly MQL target, the marketing team needs to do a bunch of stuff that drives high volumes of cheap, low quality leads that don’t buy. All the program budget goes to:

-Content Syndication
-Low Intent Google Ads to drive gated content downloads 
-High volume performance marketing on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. 
-Pay-per-lead programs 
-Google programmatic display ads and YouTube ads set to optimize for “max conversions” that drive a bunch of unqualified spam “MQLs” into website forms

The solution? It’s simple.

CHANGE THE GOAL.

The moment the executive team changes the goal from “MQLs” to Qualified Pipeline, all of the high volume lead gen tactics that drive significant Sales/Marketing misalignment immediately get thrown out the window.

Why? Because these programs don’t actually drive qualified pipeline. All they do is pump up a made up MQL metric. And the data in Salesforce clearly shows this EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Changing the goal to something that actually matters immediately forces a dramatic shift in the Marketing strategy and how investments are deployed.

With many companies facing Marketing budget cuts going into H2, there’s never been a better time to break the current MQL hamster wheel machine and start building the demand engine that will drive sustainable business growth over the long-haul.

"Signal-based selling is the future of B2B go-to-market. 

The first wave was the movement to account-based (Right Fit). 

And the next wave that’s coming on strong right now is signal-based (Right Time). 

Signals are signs of intent that our buyers (people and/or accounts) send us that indicate some type of interest. 

Every time your SDR or Sales team takes an action to engage with a prospective customer, there is a “signal” that drives that action. Example signals might be:

Website - Demo Request
MQL Score
Intent Data - First Party - Pricing Page Visit
ZoomInfo - Cold Lead
Webinar Attendee
Intent Data - Third Party - G2
Intent Data - Third Party - Usergems 
Website - Content Download - XYZ E-Book
LinkedIn - Content Download - Lead Gen Form

And for a mature, developed B2B company, over a year, they would collect literally millions of data points around this.

Signal -> Sales Action -> Disposition (Recycled, Meeting Booked, Qualified Pipe, Closed Won)

And when you analyze those 1 million data points, you see clear patterns around what intent signals lead to high sales productivity, closed won revenue & sales velocity.

Conversely, you quickly see all the signals that Sales & SDRs take action on that are completely unproductive - total waste.

This data & insight are critically important to all GTM leaders. Because Sales resources are the most expensive resources in the entire company. And triggering them to take action on low quality signals means:

-We are wasting significant Marketing program and headcount investments to create buyer signals that don’t drive revenue.

-We have (sometimes extreme) excess of Sales & SDR headcount to take actions that are clearly unproductive and don’t lead to results.

-We likely have serious revenue leak in our early stage sales process because we blend tons of low quality leads with a small amount of high quality ones.

The problem? Most B2B companies, even highly successful ones, don’t track this data!

Here’s how to fix it in less than 30 days:

1. Every time your Sales team takes an action, automatically log the data of WHY they did it (what was the signal that triggered our Sales team to take an action).

2. Track the OUTCOME of every time your Sales team takes action. And then track it all the way to Recycled / Close.

3. Aggregate and analyze the data and find the patterns.

Once you’ve collected a meaningful amount of data, you will see clear patterns on what buyer intent signals lead to high sales productivity and which signals are entirely a waste of time for Sales to engage.

4. Optimize your entire GTM investments and strategy related to Intent Capture based on this data.

_____

In this new era of EFFICIENT GROWTH, we need to use DATA to optimize processes, identify and cut waste, and adjust investments.

Department-level analytics don't tell the full story. We need to look at the data as a HOLISTIC GTM - not analytics & data silo'd by departments.

"We are not in the “Marketing needs to do more with less era”. This narrative is toxic and flat out wrong. 

The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS. 

---

To achieve proper unit economics, B2B companies must create approximately $10 in pipeline for every $1 they spend on Marketing and SDRs combined. 

Yet, the median performance across 50+ mid-market companies we’ve analyzed is only $3 in pipeline for every $1 in spend. 

That means Marketing needs 3X more budget to hit the desired pipeline goal. And companies need 3X more SDR headcount. 

So, instead of spending $10MM to produce $100MM in pipeline, they’d need to spend $33MM to produce the same $100MM in pipeline. 

This seemingly subtle difference cascades across the GTM machine and changes total CAC payback periods from approximately 18 months all the way to 50+ months - a crippling blocker to business growth and scalability. 

And even with the inflated spend, they likely still wouldn’t get to the goal since unit economics degrade with scale, especially when executed on accelerated timelines rather than measured and methodically. 

---

TLDR: Marketing doesn’t need more budget to hit the 2025 plan. 

What really needs to happen is for your GTM machine to create pipeline with proper unit economics that lead to scalable efficient growth and target sales quota attainment. 

Spending more money isn’t the answer. Making your existing spend work 2X-3X harder to achieve proper unit economics through smart, focused, disciplined execution is the real solution.

"For the first time ever, lots of companies and executives are challenging the SDR model. 

And I think it’s smart. 

It’s the first time the “Predictable Revenue” model has been challenged since companies started doing it 12-15 years ago. 

Those of you who have followed me for a long time, know I’ve been challenging the SDR model since 2017. Because I looked at the data in 2017 and even back then it was clear this function does not perform when scrutinized against REVENUE. 

But back then, we were in the growth at all costs era and nobody cared. Executives and investors didn’t care if their SDR team had a CAC payback of 4 years. And to be direct, many executives I interacted with didn’t even calculate metrics like this. 

They just chalked it up to “this is how we do B2B Sales” and accepted it. Similar to how B2B companies build trade show booths every year, rarely get appropriate ROI from those investments, but still go every year because “we have to be there”. 

Now, we’re in the era of profitable, efficient growth, and companies need to rethink their entire GTM strategy, operating model, and cost structures. 

Finally, there is the pressure pushing down that forces companies to scrutinize all the things they do in GTM that they’ve accepted as “best practices” for 10+ years. 

For the SDR model specifically, I don’t think the right conversation is whether or not we should do outbound prospecting. And I’m not sure that will ever be the right conversation. 

Instead, I suggest GTM executives and companies start with a blank sheet of paper. Forget everything you’ve done in the past and workshop this topic together:

We need to do “business development”. How do we do business development in 2024? 

And if you had the discussion as a team of executives, you wouldn’t end up with a strategy where you have 22 year olds with auto-dialers calling CFOs and CISOs. 

As you iterate on your 2024 GTM plan, try starting with a blank sheet of paper. Start with first principles. Think about your customer and what they want. 

If you did, you’d certainly end up with an entirely different GTM strategy than what’s in place today.

"B2B executives don’t realize that department-level source attribution is the *cause* of their pipeline problem, not the solution. 

I sat in yet another meeting yesterday where Marketing, Marketing Ops, and Biz Dev leaders debated which attribution model they should use…..5 minutes in, I wanted to blow my brains out ☠️ 

I just can't take it anymore. These debates are useless.

The SDR leader wants a first-touch attribution model so SDRs get credit when they load leads into the database, citing that the SDRs get “demoralized” when they book a meeting that gets tagged as inbound. 

The Marketing team wants it to be “Marketing-sourced” if there’s any Marketing touch within 45 days. 

The Partner team wants it to get tagged as “Partner” and take precedence over everything when a Partner is involved. 

Every department just fights over credit for sourcing the lead, every department celebrates “sourcing” a % of revenue, while the financial planning model breaks down IRL and the company misses growth targets by a mile. 

Then - and this is the hilarious part - they try to fix the problem by changing the attribution model 😭 😭 

It’s like admitting you have a drug problem, and then deciding to switch from cocaine to meth. 

So, to reinforce the fundamental flaws of this approach: 

1. Using lead source attribution credit by department, regardless of which attribution model you use, is a terribly sub-optimal way to plan, measure, and optimize your GTM when you need to deliver scalable growth aka sustainable unit economics. 

2. Comparing Demand/Marketing (triggers and detects buying signals) with Prospecting (engage buyers 1:1 and book qualified meetings/opps) is like comparing apples to monkeys. They are NOT the same thing and any logical human would arrive at this conclusion with a small amount of critical thinking. 

3. Using this incredibly short-sighted and simplistic planning model forces all Marketing investments to appease the attribution model - skewing investments all to 1 part of the buyer journey (database capture) and causing extreme self-inflicted pain & dysfunction in the Pipeline Creation process. 

4. We should be measuring, comparing and optimizing the effectiveness of our Supply Chain (all of the 1st-party and 3-party signals that enter our Revenue Factory for Prospecting). 

5. We should be measuring, comparing, and optimizing the effectiveness of our Prospecting (all of our efforts to engage buyers 1:1 and create qualified opportunities, including AI, SDRs, and AE prospecting motions). 

___

If you spend just a small amount of time thinking about the current situation, you’ll too see that all of these debates & meetings & tech projects are a total waste of time. 

It's time for C-Level executives to fix the real problem. Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing your GTM like 4 low-quality department-level assembly lines. And start running your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

"In 2019, I was one of the first people to post video content on LinkedIn consistently, and 5 years later, it paid off BIG. Here’s why I did it (and it’s not the reason you might think): 

Many people think I had some grand plan about video content. That it would be the future of LinkedIn and I saw something that other people didn’t see. 

But that’s not the case. In reality, it was so much more simple than that. 

I started posting mostly video content in August 2019 because tons of people plagiarized all my written content. 

I’d post content and wake up the next day to a half dozen people copying verbatim my exact post. Someone in the UK would just straight copy and paste it. Someone in Germany would translate it to German and write the same thing. Lots of people called it out but LinkedIn did nothing about it. 

So I thought to myself, they can’t copy a video. My face. My voice. My depth of understanding. So that's what I did. 

Video content created a whole new level of trust and credibility for me on LinkedIn because you can see and feel my understanding of the topics, my ability to explain them down to the exact metrics and root cause, and my conviction in the ideas based on tons of large-scale data. 

___

Lots of people still copy my content today. But now it’s happening differently for me and many other companies and thought leaders. 

Now people are copying my messaging. They trademark my language. They steal my ideas. 

But put most people to the test - put them in front of a crowd for a live Q&A. They’ll get detailed questions and break like cheap glass. 

Because it’s easy to copy words that someone else said. It’s not easy to fake truly understanding the market, the metrics, the concepts. 

Be warned: this already happens a lot in product marketing / messaging and will continue to accelerate. Everyone copies each other. It’s never been easier to change the copy on your homepage. 

One day they’re an ABM tool. The next day they sell intent data. The next day they are Sales Automation AI. They can keep jumping from messaging trend to messaging trend, copying whatever seems to be sticking as the flavor of the week. 

Because of this, there will be (it’s already happening) a huge shift in how product marketing works. In the future, the only things that matter are:

1. What your actual customers say about you to your prospective customers 
2. What your content consumers and community members say about you to your target market 

People will look at your website. But most people aren’t going to believe what you’re saying there. People will talk to your Sales rep (since they have to in most cases), but most aren’t going to believe them either. Or your fancy messaging deck. 

They will get the real information from your customers, content consumers, and community members. 

Because that’s one of the only trustworthy, believable sources of information left in B2B SaaS/Tech industry.

"High Frequency Company vs. Low Frequency Company

Understanding this truth will change your life 👇 

Every team, group, and company has a resonant frequency. 

Frequency is the composite of beliefs, emotions, actions, and intentions. 

It starts with the capital stack.
Flows to the CEO.
Cascades to the leadership team. 
And ripples across the entire organization. 

Frequency is highly contagious. 

If you don’t assimilate to the same frequency as the organization, you’ll either leave voluntarily or be kicked out. 

__

CHARACTERISTICS OF A **LOW-FREQUENCY COMPANY**

Core Energy: Scarcity 
Leadership: Control + Micromanage
Pace: Constant Urgency + Burnout Cycles 
Culture: Competition + Zero Sum Game 
Motivation: External Validation
Success = Short Term Growth / Profit 
Energy: Draining Work + Constant Reactivity
People: Replaceable Resources 
Partnerships: Transactional + Extractive 

CHARACTERISTICS OF A **HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPANY**

Core Energy: Abundance 
Leadership: Empowerment + Trust 
Pace: Rhythmic, Spacious, Right on Time 
Culture: Collaborative + Win-Win 
Motivation: Purpose + Contribution 
Success = Integrity + Sustainable Impact 
Energy: Regenerative + Inspired 
People: Irreplaceable Contributors 
Partnerships: Mutually Elevating + Values Aligned 

__ 

If you feel scarcity, urgency, pressure, burnout, like you’re “not enough” or that you’re “falling behind”... 

Look at your environment. 
Both physical and digital organizations carry a contagious frequency. 

And to realize it’s likely your work environment is causing that to you. 

If you stay in a low frequency company, you’re absorbing that energy. 

And you don’t just feel drained, confused and “not enough” at work. You carry that energy everywhere. 

Into your health. 
Into your finances.
Into your relationships, your creativity, your confidence, your clarity.  

That’s the cost. And sadly, many tech companies are quietly taxing their people like this every day. 

Protect your frequency. Nothing is worth trading it for.

"Marketing measurement and attribution is a total mess and everybody knows it. 

The ROI of marketing investments is (often) really bad, yet gets defended by BS reports. 

Marketing measurement is flawed and totally disconnected from business financial results. 

The data collected around which department “sourced” the opportunity provides ZERO insights for optimizing the strategy and investments. All you can do with it is figure out where to point the finger about which department to blame when you miss your pipeline target (useless and unnecessary). 

Now they want to add PhD level statistics on top of incomplete, inaccurate touchpoint and impression data and think that’s gonna solve it lol. 

Or build an AI-Analyst to sift through the incomplete, inaccurate data in their data warehouse and think that’s going to get you accurate reporting and conclusions (hint: it’s not going to work and nobody at the C-Level or Board is going to trust it). 

And none of this helps you as a C-Level executive to align teams, drive strategy, allocate investments, and make confident decisions. 

Everyone is making this WAY more complicated than it needs to be. 

___

So, while everyone else goes more and more complicated to a level that nobody on the Exec Team or Board can understand….the real solution is to SIMPLIFY. 

1. Marketing is a Portfolio of Investments. 

If you break it down, there are LOTS of investments in the Marketing budget (see the video for all the examples), usually hundreds of individual line items. It’s not like you just need to babysit 3 investments. 

2. Just like a wealth investment portfolio, the Investments in the Marketing Portfolio have different purposes. 

You can’t measure the entire portfolio of Marketing and Sales Development investments in the same way, though that is what almost everyone is doing right now (with seriously underwhelming and confusing results). 

3. You optimize the portfolio of investments exactly the same as you would a wealth portfolio. 

4. Categorize the investments based on the GOAL/OBJECTIVE of the investment. 

5. Based on the OBJECTIVE, apply a consistent and specific measurement model to each category. 

6. Estimate the impact of each investment using the above methodology. 

7. Sort the performance top to bottom. 

8. With intelligence and thought and benchmark data, cut the losers, max out the winners, and test out new investments. 

9. Measure your top-level success and progress on the BLENDED impact of all investments. 

10. Wash, rinse, repeat every quarter using TTM and QoQ performance data.

"6 habits to master long *before* you get results (business, physique, money, content, whatever you want):

1. Beat the Sun Up. I get 10+ important things done before most people wake up. I tried 4am for a while but 5:40am is where I eventually landed.

2. Consistent Bed Time. Asleep by 9pm so I get 8+ hours of high quality sleep M-F. It makes more of a difference than you think.

3. Early AM workout 7 days/week. Lots of people say take a day off, but workout 365 days / year works for me. Find what works for you.

4. No Weekend Hangovers. Fucking off on weekends kills momentum.

5. Morning Journaling. 15 minutes of focused writing. Get thoughts out of my head and on paper. Practice gratitude. Reinforce my identity and goals. Set my top 5 actions for the day.

6. Stop scrolling, Start Creating. Write a LinkedIn post. Design a feature for your product. Make an IG reel. Produce a track. Create something every day (it will suck for a while but it’s amazing how fast you get better when you practice every day).

"B2B Companies spend thousands of collective hours analyzing data and building QBR reports, and still don’t know whether their Marketing is working or not. 

The CRO thinks they have a pipeline problem and is down-forecasting Q1, but doesn’t know why or how to fix it. 

The CFO sees CAC going up for 3 straight quarters but can’t pinpoint why. 

The CEO sees Growth Rate slowing down and is now getting pressure from investors. 

And the Marketing Team presents a 120-slide QBR report filled with tactical, confusing data that nobody can understand. 

The company spends thousands of hours building these reports and afterward, there’s still no alignment on what to do next. 

___

At companies > $50MM, this resource drain and lack of strategic clarity is a 9-figure problem hiding in plain sight. 

This leads to either: 

(1) Inaction - Change nothing because it’s not clear what to do. 

(2) Uninformed Investments - to try to keep up growth rate, we spend more money but not intelligently and confidently based on data. The problem compounds 1-2 quarters later and becomes even harder to unwind.  

____

Your Go-To-Market KPI stack should: 

-Quickly, confidently isolate the biggest issue / opportunity in your entire go-to-market. 
-Easily, quickly, confidently evaluate the performance of your Marketing investments. 
-Tell you exactly how many SDR headcount you need 
-Align your entire executive team on the current performance, historical trends, and biggest opportunities. 
-Provide extreme strategic clarity around the fastest path to Growth and increased EV 

____

We have done 50+ of these analyses with middle-market companies in the past 12 months Passetto. 

In less than 2 weeks, the Passetto GTM KPI Stack answers all these questions. 

And the best part?….it has nothing to do with attribution. The data is OBJECTIVE. 

So instead of spending 3 hours debating the attribution model or questioning the data quality, we can spend the 3 hours figuring out the strategic plan and investments for how we move our #1 metric and add hundreds of millions of dollars in value to the business. 

These conclusions are *obvious* when you use ditch the old department-oriented demand waterfall model circa 2012 and instead analyze & optimize your GTM like it’s a revenue factory.

See the pattern? 

Marketing isn't going to fix your GTM problem. 

Marketing Leaders are responsible for deploying Marketing budget against Marketing objectives. 

But don’t expect CMOs (or any GTM Department Leader) to deploy their department budget to fix other departments' issues or cross-functional GTM problems. 

Even though Marketing Leaders see the problem. And they *feel* the problem. They won’t allocate their Marketing budget to fix cross-functional problems. And it’s no fault to Marketing leaders, that’s how it should be. 

This is a massive insight for every GTM leadership team:

When CEOs aren’t committed to personally owning holistic GTM, and instead delegate it down to GTM Leadership, transformational initiatives that get you to the next level of growth stall out and don’t get funded. It’s often too “risky” for a department leader to authorize them. Instead all their investments, time, and effort are spent to achieve the short-term department-level KPIs. 

The CEO, supported by the CFO, needs to take full ownership of designing and optimizing their Revenue Factory so that GTM Leadership and Departments are aligned and set up for success. 

They must own and drive the long-term strategic cross-functional roadmap for their Revenue Factory. Just like they have a Product Roadmap for the next 2+ years. 

They are the only ones who can set and deploy investments outside of department-level budgets to solve cross-functional problems. 

They are the only ones who can authorize a $2MM investment to a new strategic initiative that may fail, but if it succeeds, it lowers CAC by 50% and adds $500MM in enterprise value to the company. 

Department leaders most often can’t and won’t make these calls. 

If you want to take your GTM to the next level, you *need* the CEO and CFO to own and drive it, supported by GTM leadership and RevOps.

"Spending more money ≠ More results. 

The real problem is UNIT ECONOMICS. 

To achieve proper unit economics, B2B companies need to create approx $10 in pipeline for every $1 they spend on Marketing and SDRs combined. 

Yet, the median performance across 50+ mid-market companies we’ve analyzed is approx $3 in pipeline for every $1 in spend. 

That means Marketing needs 3X more budget to hit the desired pipeline goal. And companies need 3X more SDR headcount. 

Instead of spending $10MM to produce $100MM in pipeline, they’d need to spend $33MM to produce the same $100MM in pipeline. 

And even with the inflated spend, they likely still wouldn’t get there since unit economics degrade with scale, especially when executed on accelerated timelines rather than measured and methodically. 

TLDR: Marketing doesn’t need more budget to hit the 2025 plan. What really needs to happen is for your GTM machine to create pipeline with proper unit economics that lead to profitable efficient growth and target sales quota attainment. 

Spending more money isn’t the answer. Making your existing spend work 2X-3X harder through smart, focused, disciplined execution is the real solution.

"Everything in Marketing “works” to some extent. The real question is what is the impact relative to the investment (ROI). 

When evaluating Marketing & Sales programs, it’s not a binary decision of whether this thing “works” or not.

It’s actually a spectrum - how well does it work? Or perhaps better framed as what is the ROI on this particular investment? 

You can see these binary statements of ""works"" and ""doesn't work"" all over LinkedIn and in Marketing QBR decks. A few examples:

1. “Outbound is dead”. 

No, outbound sales prospecting isn’t dead. The average B2B company we analyze captures in-market demand via Outbound to deliver 24% of new business revenue. The real problem is that companies are way over-invested in these programs and the ROI is poor. 

The real solution is to reduce investments in the Outbound programs relative to the results to improve ROI in the short-term. Then, adjust the Outbound strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the program over time - continuously increasing ROI. 

2. “Paid search works for us” 

Sure, paid search delivers attributed pipeline & revenue for most B2B companies that invest there. But the measurable ROI of this channel is usually super low. Most B2B companies we analyze get less than $0.50 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Google paid search (> 2 year Marketing CAC payback, > 4 year total CAC payback). 

With that type of ROI performance, it’s simply inaccurate to just say “paid search works”. The reality is most companies are losing money for every transaction via paid search. 

3. “Podcasting doesn’t work”

B2B companies don’t see Podcast showing up for leads in Attribution software and therefore make the binary call that Podcasting doesn’t work. The real problem is how it’s measured. Podcasting is a relatively low investment compared to programs like Paid Search or Tradeshow Booths, and therefore can deliver outsized ROI. 

One major issue is that Attribution does not factor in the cost/investment and therefore cannot make an informed decision of how well the programs are actually working. 

___

The days of deeming a GTM program “working” just because you closed a few deals attributed to it are over. All GTM programs now need to deliver results at the appropriate ROI relative to the investment. 

___

I’m excited for the evolution from Attribution to GTM Investment Analytics. You should be evaluating GTM investments through multiple lenses and data sets to make strategic decisions. Digital touchpoint attribution should weigh like 20% but most companies still weigh it 100% leading to strategic decisions and investment allocations that are often ineffective and don’t align to what customers do or want.

"It's 2024 and smart B2B companies are FINALLY rethinking their digital advertising strategies.

Why?

Because the traditional playbook of spending $100k/month on LinkedIn ads to promote a gated e-book is clearly not working:

1. UNTENABLE ROI. CAC Payback periods > 60 months on “leads” generated from LinkedIn lead gen campaigns

2. SALES/MARKETING MISALIGNMENT. Sales teams close on average 1 out of 1,000 “leads” from a LinkedIn lead gen campaign. 

3. NO SCALABILITY. The terrible CAC and sales productivity metrics make this advertising strategy absolutely impossible to scale - you burn exponentially more money as you spend more. 

So, B2B companies really only have two options:

1. Stop spending money on LinkedIn Ads. Many companies are doing this and cutting $100k/month on LinkedIn ads and moving that money to spend even more on Google Ads. 

For most companies, this isn’t really a solution. The measurable ROI on Google Advertising is also very poor and they are already way past the point of degrading ROI on this channel. 

2. Develop a new strategy for HOW to execute LinkedIn ads. A few smart companies are doing this with massive success, yet the majority of companies can’t do this because of their outdated attribution requirements to deem ROI to a “lead”. 

__

LinkedIn advertising is the most powerful B2B marketing channel on the planet right now. You can distribute content to the exact decision makers at your target accounts for $0.03 to $0.07 each. 

It's by far the best use of variable marketing dollars compared to alternative investments like building a big tradeshow booth, spending another $100k/month on Google Ads, testing ABM display ads, or all the other large line item expenses on a marketing budget. 

Lots of companies like to blame the channel - ""LinkedIn ads don't work."" 

When in reality, they need to blame themselves - ""Our strategy for LinkedIn ads doesn't work""

"ABM / ABX is an account tiering and prioritization strategy, it’s not a go-to-market motion.

"B2B SaaS revenue growth rates have slowed by over 50% in the past 2 years. 

And CAC Payback periods have skyrocketed by nearly 100% in the same period. 

These two effects combined put massive pressure on core financial metrics, business profitability, and enterprise value. 

The root cause of this is Go-To-Market Bloat (GTM Bloat) where B2B companies invest significant money in Sales & Marketing and do not get the appropriate return on investment.

Sales & Marketing is by far the largest expense on a B2B company P&L - on average 40%-60% of total revenue; and 2-3X more than they spend on Product Development, Engineering, and R&D combined.

GTM Bloat occurs across the entire go-to-market, including People, Programs, Process, and Technology.

(1) People - Too many headcount on each GTM team, caused by outdated financial planning models, in addition to the overspecialization of roles on GTM teams (SDR, MDR, Solutions Consultant, AE, Onboarding Manager, CSM, AM, etc.). Or 90-person Marketing team that should be 35 people. Average sales quota attainment of ~40% is another clear indicator of headcount bloat.

(2) Programs - This mostly happens in the Marketing budget. B2B companies dramatically overspend on large scale events and digital performance marketing - up to 15% of total revenue - and do not get anywhere close to an appropriate measurable ROI on these significant expenses.

(3) Processes - Teams, meetings, reporting cadences to support programs that don’t work. SDRs to follow up with “leads” and get a meeting less than 1% of the time. Inefficient processes create significant bloat especially when operated at scale.

(4) Technology - Buying an ABM tool for $200k per year and barely using it. So much bloated headcount increases license & seat costs for all SaaS subscriptions by 2-3X. Too many $100k+/year point solutions used by 1 department or team and not integrated or essential to the full GTM.

__

Solving GTM Bloat is the #1 opportunity in a B2B company today to increase enterprise value. This is now a CEO, CFO, and Board Level issue.

Eliminating GTM expenses that do not provide appropriate ROI could increase EBITDA by 20% or more.

Restructuring the existing investments in GTM to deliver the appropriate effectiveness could increase growth rates by up to 2X (e.g. from 18% to 36% YoY).

Or more than likely, the solution is a mix of both of these - eliminating low ROI expenses to improve EBITDA and doubling down on strategies that are already working to create breakthroughs in growth rate.

"What’s the biggest problem with planning, measuring, and optimizing your GTM based on “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” vs. “Partner” ?

Here it is 👇 

Eventually, you’ll run into unit economics challenges and data visibility challenges where you don’t know what to do with your Marketing and SDRs to keep scaling them.

^^I’ve talked to more than 100 CEOs & CFOs that express this exact challenge

And here are the problems the “Four Funnel” department-level lead source attribution & planning model causes across the revenue factory:

1. Marketing - Forces all Marketing investments into a small part of the Revenue generation process called “lead capture”. 

-Complete imbalance of Marketing investments caused by the singular attribution model leads to massive diminishing returns where B2B companies way overspend on low-quality lead generation

-Improper measurement of Marketing investments make it incredibly complicated & subjective as to whether Marketing is performing

*You should be able to know how well your Marketing is working or not with 2 metrics. 
*Marketing performance should be measured on a spectrum. *How well is it working*. It’s not binary. 

2. SDRs - No visibility to confidently scale or optimize the Prospecting process

-The only thing tracked is who books the meeting. But nothing about the WHY and HOW did we win
-The “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” planning and debate distracts everyone from the insights needed for scaling and optimizing Sales Development process

3. Sales - Sales sits at the bottom of the funnel and doesn’t have enough pipeline coverage to hit plan

-Lower quota attainment, lower PRP, forces Sales headcount adjustments
-Sales starts doing prospecting and lead generation to make up for poor performance at the top of the funnel and creates an *unscalable* GTM motion with untenable unit economics

4. Finance - Poor financial performance and ZERO clarity on what to do to fix it

-Degrading financial metrics - Slowed growth, increased CAC, lower profitability, lower enterprise value
-Strategic decisions are made based on someone’s opinion (e.g. CMO or CRO) because we don't have the right data

__

“Inbound” was a Tech Vendor’s (Hubspot) Marketing message in 2013. And somehow 11 years later, it’s still considered a “best practice” across B2B.

Meanwhile, the “Inbound” vs. “Outbound” aka Marketing vs. SDRs. vs. Sales vs. Partner lead-source origination attribution model that’s widely adopted across B2B is the primary cause of unscalable unit economics and data visibility challenges.

Stop planning, measuring, and optimizing all your GTM teams on lead source origination - a singular, totally sub-optimal attribution & planning model.

Start planning, measuring & optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

"In our analyses of over 40 B2B companies > $50MM ARR, Large-scale national and regional trade show booth expenditures consistently perform at very low ROI. 

Here’s why: 

Before 2010, trade show conferences were one of the only ways for B2B buyers to discover new products. 

Your peers and colleagues weren’t telling you about it, especially in B2B. Back then, we didn’t even have the capability to connect and learn from our peers who were also a CFO, or Director of IT, or VP Sales, or any other title. 

You weren’t hearing about new products on social media - most social media channels didn’t exist at that time. 

B2B companies didn’t have websites or put much information about their products on the internet. 

There were almost no other ways to discover new products for your B2B job or specialty than trade conferences. 

So what did a B2B buyer do back then?

-They flew to a B2B conference once or twice a year. 
-They went to sessions to learn, and maybe picked up some continuing education credits. 
-They carefully perused every booth on the tradeshow floor and learned what products were new and available. 
-And then they took all the brochures back to the office and told their colleagues what products were available. 

That is just not how the World works anymore. 

There’s just a million other more cost-effective ways to get your target customer to discover you today than hoping they stumble upon your booth at a tradeshow. 

#gotomarket #marketing #events #roi #b2b 

p.s. Having a presence at conferences can be a great idea for having meetings with customers, creating content, executing market research, holding meetings with prospects, and doing general business development.

"Grindcore = 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.
San Francisco & VCs glamorize it. Employees get exploited by it.

You sacrifice your health, creativity, and life for the illusion of freedom.
But the promised land never arrives.

👉 People who work like robots will be replaced by robots.

-Burnout waves
-Stagnating employees
-“Winning” companies propped up only by VC money

It’s a mirage, not a sustainable advantage.

We’ve seen this story before:

🚖 Uber & Taxi Drivers

-Lured in drivers with promises of freedom, flexible income and better pay. 
-Once supply flooded the market, they slashed driver pay to maximize margins.
-Now moving to automation with Waymo and self-driving fleets, cutting drivers out completely.

📦 Amazon & Warehouse Workers 

-Scaled on the back of human warehouse workers - brutal shifts, quotas, and exhaustion.
-Over time, they layered in robots, automation, and AI logistics to improve profitability. 
-Now, the workers who endured the grind are being phased out by machines. 

Grindcore is not new. It’s a recurring extraction model:

1. Lure people in with promises.
2. Grind them down for profit.
3. Replace them with machines.

It’s ironic this post is landing on Labor Day.

Labor Day was created in 1894 because society recognized the cost of overwork and exploitation.

Back then: factory workers were being worked 12+ hours a day, 6–7 days a week, with little pay and no protection. Strikes and protests erupted across the country.

Congress rushed to make Labor Day a federal holiday, a gesture to honor workers and acknowledge the abuse.

Back then: factory workers. 
Today: knowledge workers are being brainwashed into Grindcore.

Same dynamic. Just digitized.

Work should serve your life, not consume it.

The future belongs to high-frequency work:
Regenerative. Purpose-driven. Human.

Don't fall for the illusion. There's nothing noble or glamorous about being a modern-day slave.

"B2B go-to-market teams have a massive analytics problem: survivorship bias. 

Every report, technology, team, and department are only looking at the data around the times that they win. 

The bottoms-up reporting framework has every single team and budget holder across the GTM focused on ""proving the ROI"" of what they're doing, so executives only see reports about how well everything is working. 

This is a behavior pattern built during the growth-at-all-costs era. Where it didn’t matter about efficiency. If we could get 1 more customer, it didn’t matter how much it cost. 

But those days are over. Now we’re in the era of profitable efficient growth. And B2B go-to-market strategy and investment analytics need a transformational makeover. 

So, what’s the fastest way to optimize your go-to-market strategy and investments? 

Flip the paradigm completely. Instead of looking at only the times you win, look at all the data around all the times that you lose and start to systematically eliminate them. 

B2B Sales & Sales Development resources - the most expensive resources in the entire company - will take action and LOSE more than 99% of the time. 

Significant Marketing investments are made to create “leads” that lose 99.9% of the time. 

SDRs arm the spam cannons to follow up with those shitty leads and lose > 99% of the time. 

So much money spent to create pipeline and nowhere close to the appropriate return on investments. 

Then there’s over bloated Sales headcount sitting at the bottom of the funnel with nowhere close to enough pipeline opportunities to hit the plan. Which is why average Sales rep quota attainments sits around 35-45%. 

The financial dynamics within a B2B company have fundamentally shifted. We need to follow suit with:

1. New go-to-market financial planning models built on efficiency
2. New analytics strategies focused on optimizing the holistic GTM, not “proving the ROI”
3. Significantly more discipline and balance around how we deploy investments across the entire GTM (create pipeline, close in-market accounts, and renewal/expansion). 

The fastest way to get there is look at all the times that you LOSE and start cutting those investments and tactics out of the mix.

"B2B Marketers on LinkedIn love to talk about “building brand” but the reality is that on average less than 10% of Marketing investments go there. 

And then another 2-5% is spent on “Customer Marketing”. 

And then another 2-3% is spent on Marketing to active in pipeline deals. 

And finally, 80-90% of the Entire Marketing program budget is spent specifically to trigger signals. 

Trigger Signals = Invest money to create a signal for Sales to follow up or otherwise take action on

-Google Ads / Bing Ads
-Content Syndication (Spread out across 5+ vendors)
-Virtual events / webinars 
-Trade Show booths / Field events 
-LinkedIn lead gen programs 
-Buy an ad to get an account on our website so we can call it an MQA
-The list goes on an on 

And the reality is very few companies track, measure, and analyze the *outcomes* of these signals. 

There are signals where tons of Marketing dollars get spent and tons of SDR human capital is invested that literally generate $0 in pipeline, but they never see it because they don't track the data. 

When you track and analyze signals, you get IMMEDIATE, CLEAR, FAST insights about how to optimize your Sales & Marketing investments. 

Both at a global level - i.e. these are things we do that never work across all segments and regions - cut them. 

And at a segment level - i.e. these are the things that really work for our Enterprise segment in EMEA. 

The growth at all costs era is OVER. Signals, specifically, tracking, measuring, and analyzing the OUTCOMES of all of these signals, is the clearest path to building and scaling an efficient, sustainable GTM engine and achieving Rule of 40.

"PSA: Beware of the “benchmarks” you see on LinkedIn.

All the “benchmarks” I’ve seen on LinkedIn this year are misleading and wildly inaccurate.

1. Companies with an ACV less than $4k have an average CAC payback period of 8 months - WRONG.

The average total CAC payback period we measure for ACV less than $4k is more than 36 months including Marketing programs & headcount, Sales, Technology & Tools, SDRs, the “Growth” team, etc.

2. 50% of B2B advertising budgets are spent on LinkedIn - WRONG.

LinkedIn advertising is almost always less than 15% of the total digital advertising spend when you consider Google Ads, Bing ads, content syndication, display advertising, and other social media advertising.

3. Company pages are better on LinkedIn because the CTR is so much higher - WRONG.

Click-through rate is a terrible metric to determine if one thing is “better” than another.

4. “LinkedIn MQLs” convert to opportunities at 37% - WRONG.

LinkedIn MQLs convert to opportunities at less than 3% for effectively every company we analyze. And LinkedIn MQLs convert to customers at less than 0.2% on average. There is large scale data from Metadata that confirms this with 200,000+ MQLs.

5. Companies with an ACV more than $25k have an average CAC payback of 17 months - WRONG.

B2B companies don’t even have a Marketing CAC payback less than 17 months. Add in Sales, SDRs, Growth Team, Tech & Tools, Operations and all of a sudden the average CAC payback for this ACV range is 48+ months.

__

And as I look at all this data and misguided conclusions, all I can think is that I’ve analyzed 50+ B2B companies in the past year (and 250+ companies in the past 5 years) from all types of verticals from SalesTech to HR Tech to FinTech to Cybersecurity SaaS to vertical SaaS and more - getting actual financial data and actual Salesforce data - and none of these “benchmarks” are anywhere close to what’s happening in the real World.

And here’s why to use extreme caution when you see data like this:

1. Most of these benchmarks are created through surveys. People can just answer and guess what their numbers are w/o even pulling actual data.

2. Literally zero companies are measuring and tracking their revenue data in the same way. ZERO. And if the core data isn’t consistent, the benchmarks are wrong too.

3. None of the data is reviewed or validated by a third-party.

4. No common set of terminology, definitions or data standards are used to create benchmarks.

5. Bringing attribution models and other company-specific models, calculations and assumptions make it literally impossible to compare apples to apples between companies.

It’s like running science experiments without any equipment and just pulling numbers out of thin air.

It’s like trying to measure how far a mile is without defining what a mile means.

It’s bad science. Misleading and inaccurate.

"Most SaaS companies are trying to implement a “Four Funnel” MQL Waterfall Model and it 100% will not fix their GTM. 

It sounds great and easy in theory, so they can divide lead source credit between Marketing, Sales, SDRs, and Partners. But it will 100% fail in practice. 

Because they are taking the outdated, ineffective MQL Demand Waterfall Model from 2012 - that doesn’t work in today’s environment due to unsustainable unit economics - and breaking it into 4 smaller MQL Demand Waterfall Models based on department lead source credit that also won’t work. 

They’re going to spend 6-12 months implementing it in their CRM and it’s 100% not going to fix their GTM problem. Ironically, it’s going to make things worse. 

I understand this model deeply, have implemented it many times, and personally recommended it from 2018-2022. But it will 100% fail in today’s environment because it does not produce SCALABLE UNIT ECONOMICS. 

This highly inefficient model makes it “easy” for Finance to do annual planning and try to measure ROI yet basically impossible to scale, plan, forecast, diagnose, and optimize.

For mature companies, billions of dollars in enterprise value are on the line over the next few years……So be careful where you get your advice from - 

All of the “best practices” and “framework” B2B companies get from Gartner, Forrester, and Tech Vendors were built for the Growth at All Costs Era and *do not* work in today’s environment where sound unit economics are fundamentally required. 

Stop using attribution as your KPIs. Start planning, measuring and optimizing your GTM like a Unified Revenue Factory.

"Not achieving proper Unit Economics at the “top of the funnel” is the most painful, expensive problem in the entire B2B industry. And most CEOs don’t even realize it. 

The resulting impact:

-Minimum -$100MM per year in lost shareholder value
-Minimum 10% slower revenue growth 
-150%-200% higher New Logo CAC 
-Lower pipeline coverage, quota attainment, and per rep productivity (PRP)

Why is this happening? 

It’s simple: 

Nobody in the entire GTM is truly accountable to a Unit Economics target at the “top of the funnel” 

B2B Companies can’t even measure this metric because they only track expenses by GL code. 

And because they are unable to clearly define and align on the true problem, they instead delegate ownership to fix this to VPs and mid-level managers who apply department-level band-aids that feel good but don’t actually solve the real problem*:

-Change from the MQL waterfall to the Four Funnel Model
-Hire a new marketing agency 
-Hire a RevOps firm to get more data 
-Buy an ABM platform 
-Experiment with an AI SDR

Growing pipeline doesn’t matter if you need to spend $5 to get $1. That mindset never worked but was allowed during the Growth at All Costs Era…..but it will surely get you fired as CEO in 2024 and beyond.

"Back in 2017, it was clear to me that Marketing was the biggest issue inside of B2B companies, but most executives didn’t see it yet. 

They thought they needed to hire a Sales trainer. 

They thought they needed to fire their Sales leader and hire an experienced Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). 

They thought they needed to hire 10 more SDRs. 

I know, because I worked in the companies. I reviewed the financial models. I listened to the executive conversations. 

But the reality was, even back then, the way B2B buyers actually discovered, researched, evaluated and purchased B2B products had fundamentally changed. 

It took another 3-5 years for a majority of B2B executives to see the same reality I was seeing. And by 2021-2022, the true idea of “Demand Gen” and how to execute Marketing to augment the performance of the entire GTM became commonly accepted. 

__

Now, it’s 2024 and it’s clear to me that DATA is the biggest issue inside of B2B companies and Go-To-Market (GTM) Teams. 

Most executives don’t see it yet, but to me it’s obvious. 

Because established B2B companies have incredible products, tons of happy customers, esteemed investors and brilliant people. 

So if all of those important pieces are in place, then why is the average tenure for a CMO less than 2 years? 

Why is the average tenure for a CRO less than 2 years? 

Why is the GTM C-Suite basically a revolving door? 

Why are CAC payback periods for private companies 3 years or more? 

Why is Sales quota attainment less than 40%? 

It’s because of the DATA and How It’s Used to drive strategic initiatives, investment allocations, core KPIs, planning & modeling - all the things that matter. 

Most B2B executives don’t see it yet. Just like in 2017 when I identified Marketing as the biggest issue, but for literally years my insights fell on deaf ears. It took most companies and executives another half decade to truly see and internalize the same thing I saw. 

Executives and companies that recognize this early and move will yield massive dividends, compounding growth, and a true competitive advantage. 

Because having the right data to make important strategic decisions leads to speed, rapidly improving ROI on Sales & Marketing investments, new strategies & initiatives that set you apart from the competitive set, and a whole lot more. 

I’ve seen this cycle before. 

For those of you that capitalized on my insights related to Marketing over the past 5 years, I implore you to read this post deeply and internalize that the biggest leverage point in your entire company is Go-To-Market Data and how you leverage that data to make fast, confident decisions around strategy, investments, and key initiatives.

These responsibilities get delegated down to a mid-level RevOps or Marketing employee, but none of the people building the reports, analyzing the data, or drawing the conclusions have access to the full financial data, or the experience & financial acumen to do this properly.

The Finance team wants to help and drive the GTM to operate efficiently and within financial guardrails so they can deliver for the board and shareholders, but they lack the GTM expertise to weigh in on what needs to change. 

Everyone is searching for a quick fix. Let’s slap a new attribution tool or mix-modeling tool on top of our messy, incomplete, inaccurate CRM data architecture. 

Then we can hook it up with our Power BI dashboard, do a bunch of offline data manipulation to try to reconstruct our shitty CRM data into something usable.

Now they want to add PhD level statistics on top of incomplete, inaccurate touchpoint and impression data and think that’s gonna solve it lol. 

Everyone is making this WAY more complicated than it needs to be. 

So, while everyone else goes more and more complicated to a level that nobody on the Exec Team or Board can understand….the real solution is to SIMPLIFY:

1. When you properly frame the problem, you’ll realize there’s no single technology tool or silver bullet to fix this problem.

And fixing the biggest problem in your entire company that’s costing shareholders $50MM+/quarter *should* be hard. There are multiple layers to the problem. And your RevOps team isn’t going to fix it (sorry not sorry).

2. Most everyone delegates the problem to mid-level employees that operate within their department silo’s. 

This is a FINANCE problem that intersects with GTM and requires deep GTM expertise. Offloading it to your RevOps team is a losing strategy. Offloading it to your Marketing Director - also a losing strategy.

3. Solving it within department silo’s forces bottoms up tactical solutions that don’t layer up to C-Level insights & strategy and Board-Level clarity & confidence. 

The real way to solve this is tops-down. Which requires C-Level executives to OWN the problem. Which feels super logical considering it’s the most painful, expensive problem in a B2B company today.

4. Everyone is overcomplicating it with a million touchpoints & PhD level statistics when the real solution is to SIMPLIFY.

"It should be *impossible* for Marketing to hit their targets 2-3 quarters in a row while Sales misses quota and the Company misses growth targets.

-You can try to have a Pipeline meeting on Wednesdays

"We’ve run our Revenue Diagnostics process on more than 40 of the leading SaaS companies in the last 180 days and here is the craziest finding of all:

High-Performing Marketing teams deliver 10X more net new revenue with the same budget than Low Performers. (yes, you read that right). 

Here’s how it breaks down:

Low Performers: $0.27 - $0.40 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. This equates to a 30-42 month CAC payback on just the Marketing expenditures (add in Sales, Ops, SDRs, etc.) and you are at 48-60+ months in total CAC payback period. 

Median: $0.89 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. This equates to a 14-month Marketing CAC payback period. 

High Performers: $2.55 - $3.10 in new business revenue for every $1 spent on Marketing. This equates to about a 4-month Marketing CAC payback period. 

___

Here are some of the patterns we see that set the high performers from the rest:

MARKET. This one is difficult to control but seems to be a top contributing factor. High performers sell products that are a need to have, not a nice to have. For instance, Cybersecurity companies typically fall on the high performing spectrum. Companies in HR Tech, MarTech, etc. may fall on the lower on the spectrum as their products could be considered “nice to have” in this market. 

THOUGHT LEADERSHIP. High performers have a well-oiled machine of effective thought leadership content marketing that they’ve invested time and money into for a long period of time. 

GTM MOTION(S). Companies with a dual PLG - Enterprise Sales motion tend to have lower Marketing ROI. I have not identified the root cause as to why yet. It could be that dual-motion companies spend more on Marketing as a % of overall GTM budget. Or it could be that they are over-invested in digital performance marketing to get lots of low value SMB customers through the PLG motion. Or something else. I will continue to investigate and report back, but this is definitely an initial clear pattern. 

ACV ($). Not fully validated yet, but there seems to be a correlation that companies that command higher and stable ACVs deliver overall stronger marketing ROI.

"“Our Marketing Investments have a time lag”. Partially true. And simultaneously incredibly misleading. Let’s break it down 👇

This blanket statement shouldn't be a blanket statement. And this mindset leaves tons of CFOs confused, leads to CMOs fired every 18 months, and degrades company KPIs & performance.

1. *Some* “Marketing” Investments, when executed properly, have a time lag. 

First, “Marketing” is a terrible category for investments that include short-term and long-term, strategic and tactical - massively competing objectives. 

For the past 6 years, I've personally executed Demand Creation programs that have a time lag to results: Non-Conversion-Based organic social media, podcasts, live events, influencer collaborations, etc. I understand these programs deeply & have driven $50MM+ in revenue for my own businesses through them.

*Some* Marketing investments have a time lag. Yet go to any B2B SaaS company IRL & almost none of the investments fall into these categories.

2. Most B2B Marketing programs are the same as 4-8 quarters ago. Meaning the “time lag” has already passed.

It’s different if you’re $500k ARR & just getting off the ground. But B2B Marketing strategies & investments for a $100MM company are the same as they were 2+ years ago. The time lag has passed & results (ROI) are still going down. Have you waited long enough yet?

3. A majority (up to 90%) of B2B “Marketing” investments are spent on short-term activities. You can use leading indicator KPIs so you don’t need to wait a year to know if the investments will pay off.

Up to 90% of “Marketing” investments are Performance Marketing objectives and measured against leads, meetings, and pipeline. That’s the goal. 

So if you make an investment and then don’t get a meeting…..that means you also won’t get pipeline. And also won’t get revenue. You don’t need to wait 6-12 months for the “time lag” to know it’s ineffective. 

4. Tons of “Marketing” investments are totally useless. The time lag theory confuses people into thinking if they just wait 12 months, the investments will start “working” when they never will. 

-What’s the time lag of a display ad that loads on the page but never gets seen?

-What’s the time lag of a tradeshow booth that 99% of attendees never see?

-What’s the time lag of a $12 CPC Google Ads that a bot clicks on and bounces immediately?

-What’s the time lag of a cold call that doesn’t get answered?

-What’s the time lag of an e-book that gets downloaded and never opened or read?

-What’s the time lag of an email that gets opened just so the recipient can click unsubscribe?

Just because you can track something doesn’t mean it’s valuable. Or that results will eventually come if you just wait long enough.

"Attribution (the tool) isn’t the problem. It’s how it’s used (the process) in B2B companies that is the real problem. 

Just like using a hammer (the tool) to pour concrete (the process) doesn’t make sense.

You wouldn’t blame the hammer. You wouldn’t try to switch from a hammer to a mallet. You’d fix the process and use different tools. 

The *PROCESS* is the real problem. But I watch almost every B2B company try to fix it by changing the *TOOL*. 

What a miss. Which results in:

-Massive GTM Team Misalignment

-Marketing / SDR / Partner teams fighting over credit based on whatever attribution model you choose 

-Lack of data visibility to make confident decisions around how to scale Marketing and SDR investments 

-Finance’s over-simplistic ROI calculations by department and channel provide zero strategic insights for what to do next

-Most GTM leaders default to spending more money, hiring more reps, requesting more budget. Rather than getting more efficient 

-RevOps wasting months debating whether they should switch from a first touch to a linear model & making no changes

-Sales starving at the bottom of the funnel, so they need to do low-quality prospecting which increases CAC & kills scalability 

-CFO feels like Marketing & SDRs aren’t working, but doesn’t know how to drill into CRM data to confirm & figure out what to do next

What a mess. 

And meanwhile, it costs shareholders and investors more than $50MM every quarter that it doesn’t get fixed. And delays the time horizon for the compounding power of a SaaS businesses. 

It’s one of the most painful, expensive problems in the entire B2B industry today. 

How to fix it:

1. Adopt a shared “First Team” Department-Agnostic set of GTM KPIs 

2. Create a new structure and taxonomy for how you tag, track, and evaluate all GTM investments that is smarter and more sophisticated than which department spent the money. 

3. Fix your CRM architecture so you actually have visibility and tracking of KPIs (not touchpoints!!) across the entire pipeline process so you can proper invest, optimize, and scale investments to Create Pipeline 

4. Build Revenue Factory instrumentation that uses touchpoint data and other forms of statistics in a variety of views to answer key specific questions

5. CFO oversees and optimizes the entire GTM investment portfolio and strategic roadmap to get the best short-term and long-term ROI. 

Your Pipeline Problem is the most expensive problem in your entire company. 

Stop trying to change the tool and instead fix the process!! And when you do, you add hundreds of millions of dollars to your company's value and build a true path to scalability and IPO.

"Just so you know, hiring a new marketing agency isn’t going to fix your GTM problem.

All you’re doing is changing the pit crew for your race car. Sure they may change the wheels better (and that’s a good thing), but it’s not going to be why you win the race. And it's not going to help much if your race car sucks.

And here’s the key insight: Even though many resources to fix this problem come from Marketing, the Marketing department can’t fix this on their own. 

This is truly a GTM problem, not a Marketing problem. And the only people who can truly solve this are the CEO and CFO. 

Because the GTM planning model, governed by finance and monitored by the board, is likely the reason your Marketing is under-delivering in the first place. 

It’s not due to lack of talent, technology, or resources.

It’s because our GTM planning and attribution model drives all of the wrong behaviors with our $15MM per year on Marketing and SDRs. And totally fails to give us proper insights to build a confident go-forward plan to accelerate growth.

There are only 2 things that happen when you change your marketing agency in hopes they come and save the day, but fail to change the KPIs that determine success of Marketing overall and the agency:

1. The Marketing agency succumbs to your outdated attribution model and runs ineffective campaigns because they appease your attribution model. In 6 months, you see no “results” and give up. You waste 6 months and a lot of money and go nowhere.

2. The Marketing agency runs their more effective Marketing strategies aligned to business results, but since you didn’t change your planning and attribution models, at the exec level, it looks like the agency isn’t working. After 6 months, you unknowingly cut bait on a strategy that’s working because you measure the wrong things to determine success.

No wonder companies change marketing agencies every 12 months.....and then they blame the problem on the agency or fire the CMO.

When a Marketing agency fails, it’s YOUR FAULT. It’s your fault for not setting them up for success, aligning their activities to growth rate and ROI, and setting clear guardrails around performance.

In fact, it doesn’t matter who runs your demand gen program - whether it’s an agency or an in-house team.

If the CEO and CFO don’t change their GTM planning and attribution modeling, you’re very unlikely to see a tangible impact on business results just by changing internal or external talent for campaign execution.

I imagine this isn’t a “popular opinion” but don’t shoot the messenger. I’m just here telling you what you need to hear instead of what you want to hear 🙂 

Nothing changes if nothing changes. CEOs, CFOs, and Boards need to fix the real problem.

"GTM Efficiency is the #1 issue for CEOs and CFOs today. 

And Finance is the department who’s going to solve it. 

This key performance indicator encompasses Growth Rate and Unit Economics - the two biggest drivers of increasing enterprise value in a B2B company today. 

The problem is that departments inside a GTM engine try to calculate these numbers individually to “prove the ROI” of their department-level investments without consideration or visibility into the top-level financial metrics. 

The Marketing Department calculates “Advertising CAC” and takes the digital advertising spend and divides it by website-sourced revenue and calculates a 9-Month Advertising CAC payback period. 

The Demand Gen team celebrates for hitting their goal. 

The SDR team calculates “cost per meeting booked” and takes all the meetings booked and divides it by the number of SDRs and calculates a $2,000 cost per meeting booked.

The SDR team celebrates booking meetings at what seems to be an acceptable efficiency. 

What these calculations miss is all of the additional costs outside of their department that are required to acquire this revenue:

-9 additional months in other Marketing programs (AR / PR / Events / Content / etc.)
-9 additional months in Marketing headcount
-9 additional months in SDR headcount
-18 additional months in Sales expenses (AE, SE, etc.)
-9 additional months in Operations, Tech, Admin, Tools 

And all of a sudden, the Demand Gen team is celebrating a 9-month advertising CAC payback period while the CFO is calculating a total CAC payback period of 56 months. 

Department silo’s look vertically and measure the cost of their small part of the process.

Go-To-Market leaders look horizontally across the entire customer journey to understand the full cost of acquiring, retaining, and expanding an account. 

The CEO and CFO are the only two executives with the view of the entire go-to-market performance. 

They are responsible for deploying a portfolio of investments (Marketing, Sales, SDRs, Operations, Enablement, Tech/Tools, Admin, etc.) to get an appropriate ROI of incremental ARR.

"The Demand Waterfall / Predictable Revenue MQL hamster wheel is cracking like cheap glass. 

In fact, it has been for more than 5 years. The data was clear in 2018 that this strategy of getting tons of cheap MQLs so our SDRs can cold call them results in:

-Untenable customer acquisition cost (CAC)
-Extreme sales/marketing alignment issues 
-Low Sales productivity 
-Poor Marketing ROI 
-Totally breaks with scale 

But we were in the boom times from 2018-2022. Money was cheap and companies were operating for “growth at all costs”. Investors pushed companies to deploy massive amounts of capital to grow, regardless of the unit economics. 

Most companies didn’t care (or didn’t even look at the data to see) that their “MQLs” converted to customers at 0.1% (1 out of 1,000 “leads” actually become a customer). This extreme inefficiency forced companies to overhire SDRs and Sales Reps to sort through all this garbage trying to find a needle in a haystack. Marketing programs, SDR headcount, and Sales headcount costs bloated across the entire GTM. 

Now, it’s 2024 and there’s been a total 180-degree turn in B2B. Every company is forced to operate for “profitable, efficient growth”. 

-Revenue growth rates are down > 50%
-NRR has consistently declined for the past 6+ quarters
-CAC payback periods have more than doubled to 36 to 48+ months
-Budgets are tightening
-GTM teams are shrinking
-More layoffs are coming
-And unit economics and EBITDA margin are now the top priorities

Companies are stuck making incremental optimizations to these outdated models like trying to improve the MQL:SQL conversion rate by 2% or improve outbound connect rates by 1% or lowering the cost per lead by $12. 

But Incremental improvements aren’t going to get the job done.

This new era of profitable, efficient growth (PEG) requires a fundamentally new approach to B2B Go-To-Market. The financial metrics *require* it and we've just about reached the breaking point.

LEVEL 6: Demand Creation Investments (some people call this “brand”) - Leverage custom analytics to analyze the performance of the (relatively insignificant) amount of budget that currently goes to this category using MTA, MMM, customer research or other means. 

LEVEL 7: THE DATA MODEL.

CEOs & CFOs are allocating $50MM+ of GTM Investments each year and the process of silo'd department-level planning and investment scrutiny is archaic and ineffective. 

The days of Marketing leaders asking for an arbitrary amount of “more budget” each year or applying blanket % increases across the GTM are OVER. 

-GTM Budgets, Departmental Allocations, and Allocations across the customer lifecycle can and should be set based on a clear process and data. 

-Business cases for increased GTM budgets, such as Marketing budget increases, should be easy to prepare & OBVIOUS whether or not to approve

-Imbalances of investment across the customer lifecycle, relative to performance, should be OBVIOUS to flag and address through GTM investment portfolio rebalancing

-Everyone on the GTM team should be aligned on #1 priority across the entire GTM

"Bottoms-Up vs. Tops-Down GTM Analytics

Let’s break down the differences 👇

Bottoms Up GTM Analytics: Data and reporting is generated & analyzed from each budget holder then assembled into a department-level deck then again assembled into one large GTM report.

Most B2B companies primarily use this approach and it’s clear it has significant drawbacks when used in isolation:

-Every report uses different data & properties
-Conflicting findings across teams & departments
-Way too tactical & complicated for executives to understand & make decisions
-Core objective is to prove/justify how well everything is performing
-Looks like every investment is working

And this bottoms-up reporting philosophy leads to:

- Focus on micro-optimizations and tactical changes
- Loses sight of the bigger picture
- Decisions that should be fast & easy become slow & hard
- Indecision / Inaction
- Misalignment across the GTM teams around what to do next

To solve this, B2B executives should run a Tops-Down Analytics process in parallel to the bottoms-up.

Tops-Down GTM Analytics: Data and reporting starts with *business metrics* and systematically works down to departments and budget holders, leveraging a standardized and consistent reporting structure across the entire GTM.

The Tops-Down GTM Analytics process:

-Starts with the most critical business metrics - growth rate, NRR, GRR, S&M % of Net New ARR, etc
-The top level business performance metrics set the context for why we’re analyzing the lower-level data
-Leverages standardizes data & fields across the entire GTM
-Breaks down the department-level silo’s and uses a holistic view of performance & investments across the entire GTM
-Analyzes and reports at the right altitude so all executives (CEO, CFO, CMO, CRO, etc.) can all understand
-The objective is to fuel *DECISION MAKING*. Not to prove or justify. 
-Puts objective scrutiny on each investment. A lot more frequently we need to be asking the question “what isn’t working” instead of trying to prove everything is working.

This tops-down analytics philosophy leads to:

-Strategic & transformational changes
-Fast & aligned decision making
-Fast, clear identification of low ROI investments
-Focused on the bigger picture

Most B2B companies are stuck. And this is the root cause. Midmarket and Enterprise SaaS companies have well-constructed strategies, esteemed investors, strong products, and brilliant people. What they are missing is the core data foundation and analytics engine across their holistic go-to-market motions and investments.

Running these two processes in parallel ensures B2B executives have the right data to quickly flag and diagnose important issues, identify major opportunities, get cross-functional alignment, and forecast & plan with confidence. While still ensuring that the departments and teams have the process and autonomy to advance micro optimizations and tactical changes.

It’s not an either or, it’s both.

"Contrary to popular belief, having a GTM team offsite will not fix your go-to-market problem. 

Neither will a pipeline meeting on Wednesdays. 

Neither will a CMO-CRO bi-weekly coffee meeting. 

Neither will firing your CMO and trying to hire a unicorn marketing leader. 

It’s a Band-Aid. 

It might make it easier for people to work together. 

It might patch up the problem for a while that will come back to you in 3 months when you’re missing your pipeline for Q4. 

It’s a Band-Aid. 

The real solution? 

Redesign your GTM (aka the Factory that produces your revenue) - Starting with Financial Planning, Modeling, and Budgeting, and then working across the rest of GTM team to Sales, Marketing, Sales Dev, Ops, Post-Sale, etc. 

1. Build a Unified View of GTM with Financial Data & GTM Data that measures both performance (effectiveness) and unit economics (efficiency)

2. Align the entire GTM leadership team on a core KPI stack that has *nothing* to do with attribution by department or channel 

3. Categorize and evaluate GTM investment portfolio allocation by customer lifecycle stage, NOT DEPARTMENT. 

4. Methodically break down compound metrics to isolate the biggest issues / risks / opportunities by customer lifecycle stage

5. Build and align on cross-functional initiatives to solve the biggest issues in your Revenue Factory 

6. Monitor and evaluate impact against the core KPI stack that has nothing to do with attribution by department or channel.

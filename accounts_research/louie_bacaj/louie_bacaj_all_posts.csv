"A Mother's Plea: Seeking AlphaFold Experts for a Rare Cancer Mission

This is the most important post I'll ever write. My son is turning 21 tomorrow, August 23rd. For the last 2.5 years, he has been bravely battling Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), a rare and under-researched cancer.

ASPS is driven by a specific gene fusion protein (ASPSCR1-TFE3). This protein is the engine of his cancer, yet we lack a detailed understanding of its structure. This is where we see a path for hope, and where I desperately need your help.

We are searching for brilliant minds—individuals, researchers, or institutions—with expertise in using AlphaFold to create a 3D model of this specific fusion protein. Creating this structural ""blueprint"" is not just an academic exercise; it's a critical step that could allow us to identify this protein's vulnerabilities. The ultimate goal is to find existing, approved drugs that could be repurposed to ""fit"" and disable this engine, opening up new, out-of-the-box treatment strategies.

The power of the LinkedIn community is immense. A simple share could connect this plea to the one person or lab in the world that can help us move the needle in the fight against this rare disease.

My birthday wish for my son is hope, powered by action. Please, not only share this post but also ask your network to share it. You never know whose screen it might cross.

Thank you for your time and support.

"I spent over $1,000 on an online writing course.

Here's why investing in writing is the best professional career move you can make👇🏽  

1️⃣ Writing is the fastest way to build a professional brand

- My water & tech focused newsletter has gone from 0 -> 3,663 subscribers in just over 12 months

- Customers, partners, and connections all appreciate learning about you and your interests outside of what your company does

- Easy way to stay top of mind with people you don't often connect with.

2️⃣ You can meet INCREDIBLE people from all over the world, many who become close friends and co-workers

- Writing online gives you 24/7 opportunities to find like minded people in places you may never visit in person. My life would be nowhere near as interesting without fellow writers like Cam, Robbie, Will, Stephen, Amanda, Karena, Florian, Louie, John, and Jim in it.

3️⃣ Refining your thinking leads to better business outcomes

- Your ability to clearly and concisely convey messages in writing, especially in a remote world, directly impacts your ability to be successful at work.

- It's always nice to avoid an extra meeting when it can be taken care of in an e-mail or memo.

If you're interested in learning where to start, the team at Write of Passage is putting on a series of free webinars next month that talk about how to start writing online.

"Have ChatGPTs and other LLM based generative AI models already reached their zenith?

As Louie Bacaj says in the screenshot, once sites like StackOverflow go, the quality of the content fed into LLMs goes down.

LLMs will also cannibalise themselves as they begin to feed off more and more LLM generated content.

Additionally, it's likely more sites will block LLMs from harvesting content as they're eating into their business models (as Twitter & Reddit already have).

So it's quite possible LLM output quality has already reached a zenith point (there are reports that OpenAI ChatGPT quality has already gone down, but due to cost saving efforts).

☂️ Making the unpredictable, predictable: Understanding the role of randomness in business. Taming uncertainty when working for yourself. How everything you have learned about succeeding in your career is invalid when randomness plays a big role. And how there's only one viable strategy for dealing with highly random payoffs.

🌲 Acquiring information under uncertainty: Probabilistic learning. Learning everything you need to know about a business, without actually knowing anything for certain. Identifying what business ideas are likely to work. Why you can succeed without knowing how you're succeeding. And why that's not a problem. 

🏕️ Bias for survival: To thrive, you must first survive. Understanding the difference between survivorship bias and a bias for survival. How to avoid going bust. Learning how to succeed by not failing.

🏆 Learning from small wins: Why small wins teach you a lot more than any failure. Why you should start with the lowest hanging fruit. How to find your own low hanging fruit. And how success brings with it other success.

🍸 Recognizing luck: Exposing yourself to randomness. Making randomness your friend, not your enemy. The cocktail party approach to serendipity. Being able to recognize good luck when it happens. And how your best ideas are often the ones you can't even imagine yet.

🤩 Emerging from the unknown: How to build credibility on the internet. Going where people already hang out. Free market research. Why you should make yourself known. How people prefer doing business with other people they like. And how to be top-of-mind.

💰 Making money: How to insert yourself into money-making opportunities. How to persuade others to give you their hard-earned money, and not regret it. Why you should charge less. And why you should monetize your hobbies.

🎢 Dealing with variable income: Why variable income makes you smarter. How to activate a new part of your brain. Why small stressors breed creativity. How to avoid overworking. And why variable income gives you more peace of mind than stable income.

🏹 Lessons from hunter-gatherers: How the world you live in is completely different from the world you evolved fitness for. What your ancestors can teach you about life, work, and satisfaction. Why procrastination is a feature, not a bug. And why it would be foolish to ignore your gut feeling, even in the modern world.

❤️ True preferences: Understanding dose–response relationships, and how they apply to everything you do. Change the dose and frequency of something you like doing, and you’ll almost certainly start disliking it. Why you might be chasing the preferences of others without knowing it. And how to discover yours.

🏖️ Lifestyle design: From a life built around your work, to a work arrangement built around your life. How to incrementally move toward a lifestyle designed to match your true preferences. And how to live a life you're proud of.

"Social media creates attention monsters. Instead of the most original thoughts, creators pursue the strongest hooks. One startup wants to change that:

How many layoff posts have you seen lately? Remote work copy-paste jobs?

When the incentive is to seek attention and get likes, behavior follows.

But compare social media to podcasts. The incentives are totally different. With a podcast feed, the creator is directly sending content to fans who have subscribed. So, instead, the incentive is for high QUALITY content.

Is it possible to create the same dynamic for writing? This inspired Chris, Hamish & Jairaj (pictured) to found Substack.

Their mission? “Make it simple to start a publication that makes money from subscriptions.” If they could create a new market of content, by making it economical for writers, they could create a new media.

So far, it’s been working. The last time we got subscriber numbers from Substack, they had over 1M paying subscribers. That was up ~100% from the year prior. At an average cost of $7 per month, and 10% take rate, that’s a yearly revenue of $8.4M. Not bad for a company <6 years old.

It’s working out for its content creators, too. The top 10 writers make over $20M a year combined. Lenny Rachitsky shared he makes more on Substack than he did as a PM at Airbnb. Substack is set to be the next Twitch or YouTube, each of which have 10K+ creators living on them.

What product strategy and positioning has allowed Substack to get to this point?

1. Substack offers true independence for writers.

You own your email list. So, you can always walk away. This is totally different from Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook’s options.

2. Substack focuses on making the experience easy & simple.

Time to publish is super low. Compared to competitor ConvertKit, Substack offers less customization, analytics, and advertising monetization features. It just makes writing super simple.

3. Substack gets the fundamentals, like SEO & deliverability really right.

My 1 year old Substack crushes my Wordpress blog of 10 years on SEO. Others have measured the same for email deliverability vs other providers. Substack is #1 in the 2 most important areas.

Substack can pursue this focused positioning because it is built for one persona:

· Not for social media personalities. They might prefer Twitter or LinkedIn’s offerings
· Not for techies. They might prefer Wordpress or ConvertKit
· For writers who wants to focus on writing.

What can we learn from Substack’s phenomenal product growth?

1. You can create wholly new markets, instead of competing in saturated one’s.
2. Simpler is better, especially if you have a focused persona.
3. Getting the basics really right, instead of just ok, is a great wedge.",165.0,13.0,3,,,Teacher,Product/Growth,Data/Numbers,Listicle/Breakdown,Text-only,"Social media creates attention monsters.

Don’t waste this opportunity with questions that don’t matter, or that you can ask your recruiter.

- What is something you’d change about the company?
- What would cause you to leave the company?
- How messy is engineering? Do you feel empowered to fix the mess?
- Do you deploy code on Fridays?
- What is the manager’s leadership style?
- Are you working on a promotion? How do you stay on track?
- What are some fun facts about your teammates?

"I just finished Louie Bacaj's excellent ""Timeless Career Advice For Software Engineers"" course!

Here are my top 10 takeaways from it:

1. Stick to startups/high-growth or big tech companies for a meaningful tech career

- Startups/high-growth companies to optimize for responsibility/scope
- Big tech companies to optimize for learning engineering best practices and compensation
- Work at companies where software directly ties to revenue (the product is the software itself)

2. Focus on ownership

- Stick to companies where software engineers are empowered to own and maintain their code (even after it's rolled out)
- Develop an ownership mindset - it's not your fault, but it's your responsibility

3. Deliver massive value

- What 20% of work will get you 80% of the results? Focus on that
- Make your code functional first
- Think about performance in B2C companies and maintainability in B2B companies

4. Develop an abundance mindset

- Find problems and opportunities to create more value in your product/system for your customers
- More problems you solve -> More resources for your company -> More rewards for you and your team

5. Build up your people skills

- Double down on relationships at work
- Empathise with your teammates and customers
- Learn to communicate effectively in conversations and meetings

6. Grow your influence through writing and speaking

- Write blog posts about your work - free credibility for you and your company
- Leverage opportunities to speak and present in meetings and presentations
- A public body of work >>> your resume
- Setup team and (eventually) company-wide initiatives. Ex: tech-talks, design reviews

7. Understand how promotions work

- Understand what the company values and deliver it. Different companies value different things
- Add value, make noise (in that order)
- Perform at the next level, and you'll be there soon

8. Leverage the power of 1 on 1 meetings

- Most important meetings of your career
- Take ownership of setting up 1 on 1's with key people - peers, product people, engineers and leaders (even from other teams) 

9. Nail your mid-year and annual reviews

- Take notes about your work and achievements weekly
- Write an excellent review for yourself

10. Master engineering concepts

- Data structures and algorithms
- One functional and one object-oriented language
- Design patterns and system design
- Concurrency and asynchronous programming
- Scalability, reliability and DevOps
- Domain-driven design

"A common mistake of developers new to a ""tech lead"" role: trying to perform every code review. They're concerned that if they don't, something will break.

But reviewing every Pull Request isn't feasible, and doesn't scale.

So, what should you do instead? 6 tips:

1️⃣ Enhance your delivery systems outside of code review.

Strengthen your release pipelines with tests, monitoring and rollback. This will help to prevent, detect and mitigate defects.

2️⃣ Document code review processes.

Team members should be aware of the expected size, scope and structure for each PR. Add automated checks for testing and approval.

3️⃣ Establish paradigms.

Introduce design patterns and structure to the codebase, that others can leverage and build on top of.

4️⃣ Integrate automated tools.

Use linters and formatters to ensure consistent style. Set up automated static code analysis.

5️⃣ Teach your team to review effectively.

Emphasize the importance of kindness, clarity, and thoroughness. Identify when blocking is or isn't appropriate.

6️⃣ Be aware of what's being shipped to production.

Slack/GitHub integration works well. Know when to scan a pull request, and when to do a thorough dive.

🔑 Remember: You can't write and review all the code for your team. If you could, hiring others would be pointless.

💡 Instead: put your team in position to ship better software, faster.

"I’ve delivered 100+ large features over last 10+ years as an Engineer/Manager/Director, here is a lesson I learned 3 years ago that completely changed the game:

> A bad & unclear decision (yet intentional) is better than no decision in 99% of cases.

This might seem extreme/unproductive, but isn’t.

Without a larger plan, there are some technical decisions you just can’t make decisively. 

—> Are you all aiming for Future State A or Future State B? 

Teams often hedge and avoid making the small decisions because they don’t know what the big ones will be.

Not making a decision might end up being worse than any of the decisions on the table would have been. 

This especially shows up with architectural decisions, where teams don’t commit to one approach or another, and end up trying to be flexible enough to support both.

It is better to make a ""bad & wrong decision"" today (and fail/revisit and improve later) than no decision today and tomorrow with the ""illusion"" that a perfect decision or solution will appear tomorrow.

In my experience, most projects fail or get delayed not because developers are slow, but because the analysis paralysis of over-engineering that slows down the decisions that the team, the department or the company has to make to move things forward even when they don’t have all the info.

And, in my experience, when you have an aggressive deadline or release target (as it was almost always the case for me and my teams in those high-performing/hyper-growth companies), you will never have all the info you need. Or, when you have that, it will be way too late.

Practice: 24-Hour Decision Making.

Promoting the idea that making a decision & iterating on it even when there is some disagreement is better for the team in the long-term than spending a lot of time trying to local optimize a decision with a lot of unproductive discussions.

Having a winner or a losser in a discussion/decision is less important to us than moving forward and iterating on things as a team and getting real feedback from users (it could be even internal/alpha users) from the production environment (it could be from the staging in some cases as well) after have gone full cycle (from requirements to deployment) and end-to-end (from database to UX).

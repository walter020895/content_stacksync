"Update: I'm now a full-time solopreneur!!

In March 2021 I started writing a weekly newsletter, Growth Unhinged, where I’d reveal the unexpected playbooks behind the fastest-growing startups. 

Since then it’s turned into one of the most trusted resources on the topic, reaching 78,000+ subscribers and 4 million+ annual views.

What many folks didn't realize: over the past 4.5 years, the newsletter has been a side project. It’s something I’ve squeezed in alongside a full-time job as a VC operating partner.

Well, that's about to change. Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/eZ8VjFQE

My aspiration is to become a modern version Gartner or Forrester designed specifically for B2B startups. Growth Unhinged will bring you fresh benchmarks, original research, in-depth case studies, and tactical how-to guides to help you go from product-market fit to category winner.

I’ll spend 50% of my time on research and writing. And I’ll spend the rest working directly with startups & scaleups around the topics I write about: pricing & packaging, AI monetization, GTM strategy, funnel optimization & product-led growth.

This leap into the unknown is only possible because of the support of this community. I don’t take it lightly.

Thank you again for being part of the journey. Now let’s get even more unhinged 🍻

"I've never seen a pricing page like this & I'm a little obsessed 😍 

monday.com includes quick 60 second videos explaining exactly why to buy its Standard & Pro plans. And I'm loving it so much more than the static pricing page!

Your product team probably built a detailed matrix on what features go in what tier so they could build out all the right feature permissions and settings.

Did that feature matrix get dumped on your pricing page as-is, leading to confusion and eye-rolls across your target buyers? Be honest.

Don’t dump that on the pricing page. Tell a story about what the customer can do with the feature.

And perhaps take a page from monday.com's playbook.

"I thought there’d be a consensus on how to monetize AI by now. I was (mostly) wrong. 

With your help, I've spent the past three months investigating what's actually happening in SaaS & AI monetization -- not just what's making headlines. And I've collected data from more than 240 software companies.

I'm so excited to finally release the findings. See for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/ePsQJT6X

Six takeaways from the new Tremont | Growth Unhinged State of B2B Monetization report:

1. Seats & flat-rate pricing are increasingly under threat.

The rise of AI, and AI agents in particular, means value gets decoupled from customers needing to buy more seats. And the costs of delivering AI means software companies need a mechanism to protect themselves if & when AI usage spikes.

2. As AI continues to gain traction, hybrid has become the ‘it’ pricing model.

Seats and flat-rate pricing are being replaced by hybrid pricing, i.e. combinations of subscriptions and usage. Hybrid pricing is up from 27% to 41% adoption (!) in the last 12 months.

Software and AI are becoming inseparable. More than half of survey respondents said they include AI capabilities as part of their core software product offering.

3. There are a seemingly infinite number of ways to structure hybrid pricing. Choose wisely (or support multiple models).

Software founders used to tell me their pricing was inspired by Salesforce or maybe Slack. Now they tell me they were inspired by Clay. Clay's hybrid model has multiple routes to expand customers while keeping pricing (relatively) simple: more features (subscription packages) and more usage (credits).

4. Outcome-based pricing is seen as the 'holy grail'. It's still out of reach for 95% of the market.

A mere 5% said their pricing model is outcome-based right now. But 25% said they expect to have outcome-based pricing by 2028. 

5. The shift toward pricing transparency seemed inevitable. This isn’t playing out.

My two cents: many software companies, especially early-stage and AI companies, don't have pricing totally figured out. And as soon as they publish pricing, it gets way harder to adjust.

6. Pricing models keep evolving. Most of the market is unprepared to keep up.

Be careful to avoid pricing ‘no-man’s land’ -- this happens between $5-20M ARR when ownership often falls through the cracks.

"This data should be such a wakeup call for GTM teams. 

Public SaaS companies ended Q1 with an estimated average gross margin-adjusted CAC payback period of 57 months based on data from Jamin Ball / Clouded Judgement (link in comments). Said differently, it takes the BEST companies nearly five years to recover their sales & marketing spending. Five years!

Zero public companies ended Q1 with a CAC payback period of less than 12 months. Only five were under 24 months (Digital Ocean, AppFolio, Atlassian, Olo and Q2). Meanwhile, 24 reported either a CAC payback period above 100 months or negative net-new ARR added.

Perhaps more troubling, this isn’t some extreme outlier quarter. It’s not something we can continue to blame on ‘the macro’ or external events. 

The average CAC payback period over the past twelve quarters is now 41 months. CAC payback periods haven’t been healthy since Britney Spears’s conservatorship ended in 2021!

Public companies can usually afford for their GTM to be inefficient in the short-term. They have plenty of profitable legacy customers who can subsidize sales and marketing. And they can sneak in a price increase or two (or three) to squeeze even more from these folks. 

But the subsidies can’t go on forever. And a reckoning could be on the horizon.

AI isn’t what’s coming for software GTM jobs, at least not yet. The real villain is GTM inefficiency. But AI might just be what saves them.

"It’s been 100 days since I left VC to become a full-time solopreneur. An update on how it's going:

For context, I write a newsletter about startup growth and monetization called Growth Unhinged. I also work with tech companies 1:1 as an advisor and consultant.

1. Y'all haven't gotten tired of me (yet). 

After 10+ years of posting on LinkedIn, I just crossed 100,000 followers (although I'm not sure how many of y'all are AI bots). The newsletter passed 500 paid subscribers in December. 

While that might sound low, it’s on track to hit 6-figures in subscriber ARR this month! (For folks interested in pursuing the creator path, you don’t need a massive audience to have a successful business.)

2. I'm resolving to make 2026 the year of upleveling what I'm doing.

I got tired of complaining about the limitations of Substack now that I'm more serious and finally did something about it. I switched over to beehiiv on December 31st and honestly I wish I had done it sooner (I also signed up beehiiv as a newsletter sponsor!). 

It felt like Substack stopped innovating for writers and decided to become a closed social media platform instead. Now that I’m on beehiiv I’m taking more control of the newsletter look and feel, improving deliverability, collecting better data about readers, learning what an API key is, setting up automations, and no longer paying a 10% Substack tax. I’m also excited to try some of their newest features: digital products, podcast pages, an AI website builder, and 🔥 website analytics. 

This shift will let me invest more in community, events, and personalized experiences in 2026.

You can see beehiiv for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/epTX3QBQ

3. I’m still working on more premium offers to make paid subscriptions a no brainer without alienating free readers.

My first offer: subscriber-only perks on top GTM tools, up to $37,067 in savings for only $150 per year. Next up: special in-depth reports (including an upcoming AI x GTM report) and new ways to bring the community together.

4. I'm realizing I'll probably never be satisfied. But that's what pushes me to get better.

Someone else will come up with a brilliant idea I wish I thought of (and had written about). I'll spend a bunch of time on a post that flops. Growth never feels fast enough. 

No matter how well things are going, I'll always aim higher. I'm trying to make peace with that rather than obsess over the business 24/7. (In the meantime, sorry to those who've become my de-facto business therapists!)

"New data from 6,525 SaaS startups: It’s easier to get into Harvard or Stanford than it is to reach $25 million ARR within 10 years. Let that sink in.

I'm pumped to announce that I've partnered up with ChartMogul as their Analyst-in-Residence (fancy title, huh?), which means I get to dig into their 🔥 dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years & share it with you.

What I found: 
 - Almost half of software startups do eventually make it to $1 million ARR after they’ve started monetizing -- if they’re willing to stick around.*
 - One-in-five make it to $5 million ARR. 
 - One-in-ten make it to $10 million ARR. 

Yet just one out of every fifty startups makes it to $25 million ARR within 10 years. The odds of doing this (2.3%) are lower than getting accepted into Harvard or Stanford (3.6% acceptance rate). 

If you’ve done it, I hope you take a moment to celebrate. 97.7% of your peers didn’t get this far. (And that doesn’t even factor in the scores of startups that never start monetizing a product in the first place!)

*Worth mentioning is that this data is based on a 10-year period, meaning it looks at companies that launched & started monetizing in 2016 or earlier. The full report will include data on more recent cohorts!

Maja and I asked our communities about their favorite B2B GTM tools in 2025 including which were ""most impactful"" and which are ""must try"". 195 software GTM leaders weighed in. (And Gemini sorted through 1,000+ open-ended responses 🤯.)

ChatGPT topped the list of most impactful tools with 50 write-ins. They were followed by OG HubSpot (40 write-ins) and breakout unicorn Clay (30 write-ins). This list included tried-and-true tools you're probably familiar with like LinkedIn, Gong, Notion, 6sense, Canva, Figma, Apollo & ZoomInfo.

Things got more interesting on the ""must try"" list. GTM leaders are trying out vibecoding (Lovable - 2nd, Replit - 5th, Magic Patterns) and AI agents (n8n - 3rd, Relay.app, Dust). Folks are also on the lookout for more & better tooling for advanced GTM plays (see: Clay, Keyplay, Unify).

"What's the right go-to-market (GTM) motion for your product? I finally have data to give you a leg up ⤵️

Introducing the inaugural 2025 State of B2B GTM report. Maja Voje & I teamed up to bring you objective data into what's working in GTM right now and where is AI honestly making an impact. It's based on data from 195 B2B companies, mostly SaaS and hybrids of SaaS & AI.

Get the full report in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/ea_zYUzB

The five takeaways you need to know:

1. There are six main GTM motions in B2B. Inbound is the most popular, but not by much. 

As much as people love to hate on Outbound, don't count it out. 37% of B2B companies rely on either Outbound or an Account-Based GTM.

Intent-based outbound is the 2nd most popular channel in terms of where teams plan to increase GTM budget in 2026. Outbound! (The 1st is AI discovery.)

2. 2025 was a year of (endless) exploration. The average software company says they have 5 core GTM channels and another 5.5 GTM channel experiments.

This is, frankly, too 👏 da** 👏 many 👏 channels for a $1-10M ARR business!

3. 2026 needs to be the year of ruthless scaling.

The single best channel in terms of likelihood of having an impact surprised me: intimate events.

The first-ever GTM scorecard can help prioritize where to place your bets (see the full report 👀).

4. Everyone uses AI, relatively few see real GTM impact.

Three-in-four GTM leaders said they have top-down pressure to adopt AI. But the impact of AI is a mixed bag. More than half (53%) said they see either no impact or limited impact from AI. 

The disillusionment was most acute around AI SDRs. In the words of one survey taker, “We tried an AI SDR for six months and were unable to generate a single opportunity.” Ouch.

5. The new GTM tech stack is mostly ChatGPT?

There’s been a proliferation of next-gen GTM tools. Only one, ChatGPT, is having a breakout impact.

ChatGPT was rated the #1 most impactful GTM tool with roughly 50 write-in mentions. The closest alternative was OG HubSpot, which had about 40 write-in mentions. Clay came in third with nearly 30 write-ins.

"Inside a marketing team with 0 marketers. It's just the founder and ~40 AI agents collectively doing the work of a 5 person team 👀

This is from Jacob Bank, founder & CEO at Relay.app, who finally got around to putting his AI agents into an ""org chart"" and it's super cool to see.

I sat down with Jacob to unpack exactly how he did it – and how you can do it, too. The TL;DR:

👉 AI agents have spiky intelligence and can be surprisingly powerful for marketing tasks.

👉 Modern teams will have hundreds of AI agents in the org chart for every one person.

👉 While that sounds complex, each individual agent is much easier to build than you think.

👉 There’s power in building your own personal AI agent stack that’s specific to your goals and style of working. (This stack is also something you can bring to future roles.)

"New data from 6,525 SaaS startups: Only 3.3% reach $1 million ARR in less than a year from first revenue. And just 1-in-1,000 reach $10 million in less than a year 🤯

When you listen to VCs, you get the impression that revenue growth happens at warp speed. 

I partnered with ChartMogul as their Analyst-in-Residence, which means I get to dig into their 🔥 dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years & share it with you.

What I found: For startups that reach $1 million ARR, it usually takes between two and five years from initial monetization. 

1️⃣ A mere 3.3% of startups reach $1 million in under 1 year
2️⃣ 13.4% reach $1 million in under 3 years
3️⃣ 25.1% reach that figure within 5 years

You can map yourself onto the curve below to find the figures that are most relevant to you including $1 million and $10 million ARR milestones.

My two cents: I think this is healthy! 

It takes real time to find product-market fit (PMF) and move from founder-led sales to repeatable growth. Premature scaling can kill an otherwise great business. 

Many of the best companies go slow to go fast: (a) Lovable spent 18 months building before their breakthrough success, (b) Clay grinded for 6 years before seeing revenue traction, (c) bolt.new's parent company spent 7 years clawing their way to $700k in ARR before their new product exploded.

"It’s been 30 days since I left VC to become a full-time solopreneur. How it’s going so far:

For context, I write a newsletter about startup growth and monetization called Growth Unhinged. I also work with tech companies 1:1 as an advisor and consultant.

1. I thought free subscribers would stall out when I introduced a paid tier. The opposite happened.

Subscriber growth actually accelerated and the newsletter passed 80,000 this week.

2. Demand for the paid tier has been solid & the newsletter cracked the Top 100 business bestsellers on Substack! 

But about half my subscribers are on monthly plans and I’m worried about what churn could look like. I need to create more premium offers to keep folks sticking around (very open to ideas!). 

I’m also getting disillusioned with the limitations of Substack now that I’m more serious. It feels like they want to be a social media platform more than they want to create tools for creators. (I’m considering beehiiv in case folks have opinions!) 

3. I was worried about being lonely and losing motivation. So far that hasn’t been an issue. 

I carve out Mondays to hang with CJ and Ben Hillman & record our new Mostly Growth pod. I carve out Wednesdays for in-person meetings in Boston. Writing happens in the morning and I try to stack advising meetings in the afternoon.

Collaborations with other creators have been a big boost. Other writers are kinda like my chosen co-workers. (Shoutout to Maja for the partnership on our first State of B2B GTM report & our constant WhatsApp messages about 🐕)

4. I haven’t been this stressed out in a while. 

Everything falls to me. When I drop the ball I can’t blame anyone else. And I’m constantly making decisions I’m not confident about.

Some of this is probably natural with trying to start a business & run a business at the same time. Some of it is self-inflicted. My main action item is getting better at saying no (I’m re-reading Lenny’s great piece on this for help.)

5. My dog has never been happier or more demanding. 

When I head out for a cold brew, he expects to make a stop at the dog bakery. (How can I say no to this face?!)

"If you haven't tried vibecoding tools like Lovable, bolt.new, v0 or Replit for GTM, you're missing out.

A 🔥 example is by the crew at Lovable and it’s brilliant. They built a Product Hunt clone called Launched where builders submit their apps & the community upvotes what they ❤️

The top 5 projects each week get 100 free Lovable credits, encouraging creators to keep building. 1,577 projects have been submitted this year alone! (Btw, most of the apps have an ""Edit with Lovable"" button, making this like a template gallery on steroids.)

Here are 10 other GTM vibecoding ideas:

1. An interactive ROI calculator (looks way more legit than that old Excel file you're too embarrassed to send your prospects!)

2. A lead magnet, aka a complex mini-product for TOFU acquisition

3. A landing page that looks like it was custom-built by an agency

4. A feature prototype for customer feedback -- you can finally prove to product that folks would pay for it

5. A lead form that looks like Typeform but with custom logic (& that's free)

6. Custom Webflow pages without needing to write code

7. A conference scraping app to set up meetings

8. An app for meeting prep research before sales calls

9. A partner marketplace to feature on your website

10. A community upvoting app to tap into community-led growth

I invited Alexander Shartsis to unpack how to use vibecoding tools for GTM (no coding skills required!) in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter. Read the full guide: https://lnkd.in/eHvrxEG6

"What it means to shift from 'spray-and-pray' marketing to a unified, account-based GTM aimed at your exact ICP ⤵

Last September I featured a story about how Parabola did all this (a) in under 30 days, (b) without a RevOps team, and (c) with a TON of 🔥 automation. 

Here’s the update: pipeline has grown by 717% since September. All with the same size marketing team 🤯 

How they rapidly built a scaled ABX motion from scratch:

1️⃣ Identified

- ICP-fit accounts & contacts are sourced using Clay, Sales Nav, Cargo 🧱 and ChatGPT
- All data gets pushed to Salesforce

2️⃣ Aware

- Accounts get warmed up with LinkedIn paid ads, scaled email, LinkedIn connections and referrals – in addition to other bespoke tactics and campaigns
- They are flagged as aware if buyers start engaging via email (2+ contacts with 2+ email opens), accept LinkedIn connections, visit the website, or engage in the community
- Tools: website tracking (Clearbit, HubSpot), email & LinkedIn automation (Apollo, Outreach, La Growth Machine), community (Slack)

3️⃣ Interested

- Accounts progress as they demonstrate more meaningful engagement & intent
- Key signals include visiting high-intent website pages (ex: pricing page), starting a free trial, attending an event, etc.
- Tools: webinar (Sequel.io), trial (Redshift), website tracking, product usage data, ETL

4️⃣ Evaluating

- All of the above is meant to generate high intent, ICP pipeline for sales
- Accounts progress here by booking a meeting with sales or requesting a demo
- This is where more manual, high-touch outreach comes into play (aimed at warm accounts)
- Tools: meeting routing & booking (Calendly), marketing automation (HubSpot)

The big learnings over the past 8 months:
 - Content & offers are everything for getting a response
 - Not all triggers are created equal when scoring account stages
 - The data won’t be perfect, don’t let that stop you
 - The best GTM plays involve both marketing & BDRs

This is what a focused GTM looks like. Marketing, sales, CS, product and even ops all play a role in building pipeline with the right accounts. Huge shoutout to the Parabola team (Alex Yaseen, Ben Pollack, Adam Reisfield) for taking folks behind-the-scenes!

PS, Parabola just launched a game-changer for anyone interested in automating workflows like ABX stages (think Cursor for Ops teams). You can check it out here: https://parabola.io/

"I asked 195 B2B go-to-market leaders about where they're placing their bets for 2026. The top channel bet: AI discovery aka AEO. Wow, things escalated quickly...

One company that got a head start on AEO is Webflow, the website building scaleup. Their stats via VP of growth Josh Grant:

1. 10% of signups now come from AI discovery, growing 4x year-on-year. (This is actual LLM-referred traffic, which likely understates things.)
2. 91% of LLM referrals come from ChatGPT alone.
3. ChatGPT traffic converts at 24% (!), 6x higher than Google.
4. For conversions referred by an LLM, two-in-three convert within 7 days.

3 tactics from Webflow you can apply in the next 24 hours (& one to avoid):

Avoid: Add an llms.txt file

 - The Webflow team tried it. They haven’t seen any significant lift.
 - The takeaway: focus on content optimizations instead.

Tactic 1: Automate content refreshing at scale

 - AI reshuffles answers constantly. Refresh velocity can be the difference between staying on top and missing out.
 - Webflow built an AI-driven workflow with AirOps to 5x their refresh frequency.

Tactic 2: Turn every webinar into 10 pieces of expert content

 - Webinars can make great source material. Repurposing makes them fresh, structured, and consistently discoverable by both people and AI.
 - Webflow automates this by transcribing webinars (AirOps), using LLMs to identify themes & soundbites, generating assets & adding an editorial review.

Tactic 3: Automate FAQs and schema content for AI discovery

 - FAQ sections answer long-tail questions and help LLMs get a more granular understanding of the product. ChatGPT can essentially ""borrow"" your FAQ answers in their repsonses.
 - Webflow automates this by scraping what people are asking via Reddit & Google (AirOps), generating new FAQs & answers (GPT-5, Claude), pushing updates into the CMS & then tracking any visibility shifts before/after.

"How to nail your next big talk 👇

I used to be terrified of public speaking. But I pushed through the nerves (with an assist from Big Pharma) & am absolutely glad I did.

If you're even a little bit like me, you'll want to bookmark this post from Vincent Pierri. He's personally delivered 300+ unique talks over the last 5 years. Now he's sharing his proven framework for a better 30 min keynote.

Read the full story in Growth Unhinged here: https://lnkd.in/eydNVYxG

The framework in four steps:

1️⃣ Nail the intro (5 minutes)

Every great talk begins with tension.

Think of your intro as the “hook.” It’s where you earn the right to keep people’s attention. 

If you lose the first five minutes, you’ll spend the next twenty-five trying to win them back.

2️⃣ Build trust (3 minutes)

Trust-building is where you prove you’ve walked the path. And your title isn't enough to get the audience on your side.

Three ways to do it:
 - Experience. A quick story of failure, experiment, or success.
 - Research. Credible data, case studies, or benchmarks.
 - Relatability. A short personal story that shows you’ve been in their shoes.

3️⃣ Deliver three main points (3 × 6 minutes)

Three points is the sweet spot. Enough to feel substantial. Not so much that people forget them by lunch.

Each point follows the same mini-framework:
 - One-Liner (1 min)
 - Analogy (2 min)
 - Examples (3 min)

4️⃣ Close strong (4 minutes)

Too many talks fizzle at the end. 

Instead, close with a one-two punch:
 - Final Story (2 min)
 - Call to Action (2 min)

I can't wait to try out this framework for my next talk. Hope you find it as useful as I did 🙏

"If I became CMO of a $10M ARR B2B startup, here's what I'd do to kickstart 2026 & 2x ICP pipeline in my first 30 days:

1. Create a list of every target account in my ICP.

I'd ask sales & CS about which factors make a great account. Then I'd bring in real-life data, analyzing all won/lost deals over the past 18 months to see which factors led to the highest expected ARR per 100 opps (equation: win rate x average ACV x NRR x 100).

These factors would almost certainly include industry, company size, and geo. But I'd look to go a level deeper factoring in tech signals, hiring signals and other indicators of buying intent.

2. Identify all the most relevant contacts at those target accounts.

I'd start with initiator and champion personas. Users, influencers, and exec buyers could come later. This data used to be hard to access, unreliable & expensive -- that has quickly changed.

3. Figure out where those target accounts are in their buying journey.

If there were 1,000 accounts in my ICP, how many were we able to identify & market to? How many are aware of us (i.e. visiting the website, engaging with ads, opening emails, etc.)? How many are interested (i.e. viewing an interactive demo, visiting high-intent pages, starting a free trial)? And how many are considering a purchase (i.e. they're sales pipeline)?

From there, the bottlenecks become obvious to the entire team. It's time to tackle them. 

4. Build a pod around the biggest bottleneck.

I'd spin up 10+ tests in the first week. The variables I'd play with: the account signal, the message, the channel, the offer, and the level of 1:1 personalization. (A manual approach would be fine to start with -- I can automate what works later.)

The lowest hanging fruit is usually to convert aware/interested accounts into pipeline. This might mean warm outbound to convert website visitors, testing personalized video over LinkedIn, offering exec access, etc.

5. Create a 🔥 content asset that I know will resonate with my target accounts.

My starting hypothesis: a State of X report featuring interviews & quotes from my ICP. I'd start with highly referenceable existing customers for social proof (low-hanging fruit). I'd then use the report as an excuse to message ICP prospects (the side-benefit: account-specific insights to personalize campaigns).

I'd build this report in public -- creating a content <> community flywheel -- to already drum up interest from my ICP well before the report was published. 

--

Why this 30 day plan works: (a) it's focused on the best-fit accounts, (b) it brings tight alignment between marketing <> sales, (c) it creates quick wins -- earning trust to take bigger swings, (d) it's the best possible onboarding, and (e) it's aggressive -- setting the bar high.

And, if it doesn't work, perhaps I'd propose another brand refresh 🙃

"In the last 8 years I've surveyed 4,000+ private SaaS companies to figure out what's going on in the industry. Never have I seen benchmarks go out of date so quickly.

Back in 2022 the typical <$1M ARR startup had 13 people. ""T2D3"" was the name of the game. Hiring a big team was a flex & the highest quartile of <$1M ARR SaaS companies had 38 (!) people. 

As of last year that figure had dropped to 7 people on average. Expectations around ARR per employee are through the roof. AI agent workflows have become the 'thirst trap' of LinkedIn. The new flex is reaching the top of the Lean AI startup leaderboard.

"The AI growth re-acceleration at Intercom via CEO Eoghan McCabe:

1. Intercom's AI agent (Fin) went $1 to $12 million in a year -- a year ago.
2. Fin is now on track to hit $100 million in 2.5 quarters.
3. Annualized growth is still 393%.
4. New customer NRR has increased from 112% to 146%.
5. Their resolution rate started at 25%. As of today they're guaranteeing 65% or they'll pay $1M (🤯) -- I'll drop the announcement in the comments.

Intercom is THE case study for anyone pivoting from SaaS to AI agents. They went all-in on AI & a disruptive, outcome-based pricing model in early 2023. Now they're adding a 90-day money back guarantee.

My top 5 takeaways from a recent interview with co-founder Des Traynor. Read the full story here: https://lnkd.in/ezrHeUeJ

1. It took a ‘war time’ CEO to be the first to go all-in on AI. 

The Monday after OpenAI released ChatGPT, Eoghan made the call that Intercom would be all-in on AI to automate work.

2. Each 1% improvement in Intercom’s resolution rate was hard fought with constant A/B testing. 

With Fin there are 15 different sub-processes involved in answering a customer support question. Most of the good AI tools are *not* simply thin ChatGPT wrappers.

3 Competition will no longer be about who has the most features. 

It’ll be about how well those features work. The winners will be the ones who write the RFP for customers, teaching them how to evaluate and buy AI products.

4. If AI agents are doing the work for you, the pricing model needs to match.  Intercom has outcome-based pricing, only charging for successful resolutions.

5. Users don’t necessarily see whether an AI agent is getting better. Educate them about improvements and empower internal AI champions.",456.0,41.0,15.0,512.0,1.34,Fortune Teller,AI/Automation,Data/Numbers,List Post,Text-only,The AI growth re-acceleration at Intercom via CEO Eoghan McCabe:,"The AI growth re-acceleration at Intercom via CEO Eoghan McCabe:

"Be careful that you don't end up in pricing 'no-man's land' 👀 

Nearly every software company I talk to is rethinking their pricing & packaging. Yet rarely is it clear who actually owns the decision -- or the work! -- apart from, perhaps, the Founder/CEO.

The latest data via my new State of B2B Monetization report:

 - <$1M ARR: The founder/CEO owns pricing (71% of the time)
 - $1-5M ARR: The founder/CEO owns pricing (69%) with an assist from sales
 - $5-20M ARR: Pricing is a hot potato between the founder/CEO (38%), product (18%) and sales (12%) -- or nobody (21%)
 - $20-150M ARR: Pricing shifts to product (43%) but becomes a team sport with input from sales, marketing & finance
 - >$150M ARR: Finance & ops play a *much* bigger role as folks focus on pricing as a lever for profitability

My two cents on the data:

1. Expect that you'll need to keep evolving your pricing. AI is simply changing too fast to blindly stick with the status quo.

2. As pricing becomes an increasingly strategic (& complex) decision, it needs to be resourced accordingly. Assign an owner to collect data on costs, competitors & customer value.

3. Involve finance & ops earlier! They can help make sure that new AI feature doesn't sink the profitability of the business.

"It’s been 60 days since I left VC to become a full-time solopreneur. It feels like it’s been 6 months. An update on how it’s going:

For context, I write a newsletter about startup growth and monetization called Growth Unhinged. I also work with tech companies 1:1 as an advisor and consultant.

1. If I had to describe the transition in one word it would be *overstimulated*. 

I see so much opportunity yet everything falls to me. Getting summoned to three weeks of federal jury duty in January certainly doesn’t help (& might’ve caused a mild panic attack). 

I’m resolving to make 2026 the year of focus and, hopefully, some delegating.

2. The newsletter became a Business Bestseller on Substack (#47), only two months after introducing the paid tier!

It’s now doing >$75k in annualized revenue from subscribers! (Ads are a bigger revenue source, although I’d like the two to be equal by the end of next year.)

3. I’m working on more premium offers to make paid subscriptions a no brainer without alienating free readers. 

Only 0.6% of readers are on the paid tier… not great compared to tech companies.

What’s on my mind for 2026: subscriber-only perks on top GTM tools (coming in January 👀), special in-depth reports, and ways to bring the community together. I’m very open to ideas!

4. My best decision yet has been to team up with CJ and Ben to launch the Mostly Growth podcast. 

It’s a great excuse to have water cooler conversations with “coworkers”. And we recently started bringing in guests like Brian Balfour, Emily Kramer, Leah Tharin, Dave Kellogg & Roland Ligtenberg.

Somehow we’re already 20 (!) episodes in, which I hear is better than 90% of podcasts. Hope folks like it as much as I like recording it!

"A modern outbound playbook for 2025:

Many predicted the demise of outbound. Well, it's alive & kicking. GTM leaders told me that intent-based outbound is the no. 2 channel where they plan to invest more in 2026, just behind AI discovery.

Here's an extremely tactical guide to what's working (and AI workflows you can steal) via Fivos Aresti, co-founder of AI-first growth studio Workflows.io.

👉 Manual cold outreach for ICP target accounts

Signals are great, but most target accounts aren't in market (yet). Start by mapping out the TAM & then filter down to a list of target accounts.

Fivos found 66,000+ companies, then narrowed it to 5,700 ICP targets. These were split into four tiers:

 - Dream 150 accounts (highly manual)
 - Tier 1 (cold calling & more personalization)
 - Tier 2 (automation via email & LinkedIn)
 - Tier 3 (automation via email only)

🛠️ Key tools: BuiltWith (identify HubSpot users), GetLatka (identify SaaS companies), Exa (crawl websites w/ AI), Crunchbase (identify funding), Apollo (identify firmographic info), Clay (research & qualification).

👉 Automated, signal-based plays for other ICP accounts

These perform 2x-10x better than cold outreach plays. The five signal-based plays they prioritized:

 - Customer alumni play
 - Website visitor de-anonymization play
 - LinkedIn connections of founders play
 - LinkedIn engagement play
 - Social listening play

LinkedIn connections of founders is performing best. Fivos sees a 25.4% (!) reply rate, although much of this is harvesting demand from 1.5+ years of posting content.

"The ability to build & manage AI agents is quickly becoming a core skill for everyone. Here are 5 of my favorite marketing use cases for AI agents -- with templates ⤵️ 

1️⃣ Lead scoring & qualification

Lead scoring is part art, part science. You want to enrich fields via 3rd party data, but also bring in form data & some human(like) judgement. 

Turns out AI agents are great at this -- and you can add a human-in-the-loop escalation via Slack when the classification isn't clear.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

2️⃣ Lifecycle emails

Traditional lifecycle emails are pretty mid (did I say that right?!). But AI agents can track new customers, analyze interesting ones & then automatically draft personalized emails suggesting next steps.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

3️⃣ Competitor tracking 

Everyone is racing to write comparative content for AI search. This content needs accurate, real-time info on competitors including features, pricing info, reviews & more (otherwise you'll get penalized).

Turns out that AI is pretty great at scraping text and sending alerts when there are significant updates.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

4️⃣ Content research

You need to stay on track with what's trending with your audience & key influencers in your space. But nobody has time to monitor dozens of LinkedIn profiles & Substacks. You can get an AI agent to do the research for you & write a report on the top-performing themes.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

5️⃣ LinkedIn coaching

AI models have spiky intelligence. While they struggle with things that seem easy, they're surprisingly brilliant at things like analysis & coaching. You can create your own PhD-level coach to improve your LinkedIn game with tips on what's going well & what to change.

See the workflow here: https://lnkd.in/eeDrZrdv

"The Figma S-1 is finally here, indicating the IPO window might just be re-opening. I read it so you don't have to -- here's the TL;DR:

1. Figma is a giant w/ ~$750M in revenue in 2024, still growing almost 50% y/y. Very few public co's are anywhere close -- median last 12 month revenue growth was only 14%.

2. PLG & self-serve is a big part of the story. Figma has 450k paying customers. The vast majority are small: Figma only has 11k paying customers spending > $10k ARR & 1k spending >$100k ARR.

3. 76% of Figma's customers use 2+ products. In 2025 Figma doubled the product portfolio from 4 to 8 🤯 w/ the launch of Sites, Make, Buzz & Draw.

4. Net revenue retention is best in class at 132%, I suspect driven by a mix of self-serve > direct sales & multi-product adoption.

5. Perhaps more impressively, gross revenue retention is 96% w/ a big asterisk (Figma only reports GRR & NRR for customers w/ >$10k ARR).

6. The customer base is surprisingly global. 85% of MAUs outside of the US. 53% of revenue from non-US markets.

7. Yes, they still have a seat-based pricing. But there are now 5 (!) different types of seats: viewers, collab seats, content seats, dev seats & full seats.

8. Figma made big pricing changes in March 2025 & the results haven't hit their S-1 numbers. This included moving away from user-driven upgrades (hurts viral expansion, but gives admins more control) & a 20-33% price increase on full seats.

9. Even though Figma is a design product, 2/3 of users are non-designers.

Very cool to see such exceptional performance & metrics.

"I don’t usually share my LinkedIn hacks, but here’s what helped me reach 90,000+ followers (up 62% y/y) and 14 million impressions in the past year. (All of that reach cost me exactly $0.)

Hope this helps more folks tap into the 🪄 of the algo. 

1. Your first step on LinkedIn isn’t to post, it’s to comment.

Find 5-10 great thought leaders in your niche. Authentically engage with their posts, esp in the first hour. You'd be surprised how helpful this is in the early days -- and how few people do it.

2. Original graphics go a LONG way. 

The best performers for me: original data/research, screenshots that have been marked up. Think infographic-style, even if it's not really an infographic. You want to draw folks in & let them come to their own conclusions. Sankey diagrams are always 🔥 

3. Don't worry so much about putting a link in your post.

What matters is that you write zero-click content, i.e. the post has standalone value and folks don’t need to click on an external link in order to appreciate it. To be honest with you, about 50% of my posts now include links.

4. Keep to a consistent schedule of ideally 2-3+ posts per week. Sunday mornings work best for me (have no idea why!).

But don't worry about trying to post every day. Who has that much new to say, anyway?

5. Find a counterintuitive perspective. 

What's nobody saying that you will go to your grave defending? What's your pet peeve that folks are still doing? This doesn't need to be a hot take. Usually it isn't.

6. You can repurpose your greatest hits. Odds are most of your audience didn't see it the first time around.

I waited too long to do this. Now I try to refresh/repost on a ~6-12 month cadence & look for times when the post becomes topical again or for when I think of a better hook.

"I haven't spent real time in the Bay Area since Allbirds were all the rage & T-Swift was still single. Something tells me things are different these days.

What brings me back: AI monetization. (Of course.)

I'm still astounded by the rate of change. In only the past few months: 
 - Salesforce introduced a new Flex Credit model for Agentforce
 - OpenAI shifted from seats to pooled credits for their Enterprise plan
 - Cursor introduced a credit-based model
 - Lovable made collaboration free & added rollovers
 - Grok added a $300 per month subscription

But it's hard to know what's really working. And it's unclear what buyers actually want -- aside from, perhaps, more predictability.

"ChatGPT just hit 800 million weekly active users, up from 500 million in March. AI discovery is the fastest-growing channel to reach your customers. But more than that, it forces us to rethink buyer journeys for AI discovery.

The team at Docebo told me AI discovery now accounts for 12.7% of their high-intent leads, up 429% (!) from last year. They're doing this with one dedicated team member (Valeriia) plus an assist from AI tools like AirOps & XFunnel.

Here's the thing: ChatGPT leads don't look like SEO or referral leads. 

They show up ready to buy, either going to your website directly (*after* they've made a decision) or searching for your brand on Google. Branded search now accounts for 85% (!) of Docebo's search traffic -- meaning 85% who come from Google already know about the company.

▶️ The old buyer journey: Problem awareness > feature research > vendor comparison > brand selection. 

▶️ The new buyer journey: AI-assisted research > network validation > direct brand search > selection. 

Read more in Growth Unhinged about what this means & how to get more pipeline from AI search: https://lnkd.in/ee2wKTbR

The TL;DR:
1. Measure your AI search performance through self-reported attribution, branded search traffic, and share-of-voice in AI queries.
2. Late-funnel SEO is the foundation for great answer engine optimization (AEO).
3. The dirty work of AEO has to get done: updating, formatting, and structuring content for LLMs.
4. You can see tangible AEO results with a modern tech stack.

"Steal this upgrade email from Calendly. It's so simple, but so good 🔥 

Why I'm digging it:

1. The advantages of upgrading couldn't be more clear

With most products, I don't *really* know the difference between free & paid. Calendly makes it black-and-white. (This would also be very easy to fwd to a manager or anyone who asks ""can't you just use the free plan?"")

2. They've done the work of recommending a plan

I'm not choosing between 18 permutations of packages and add-ons. ""Based on your scheduling needs, the Standard plan seems like a perfect match for you."" 🤌

3. They play on loss aversion

Calendly has a reverse trial where new users start with a free 14-day trial, then downgrade to a free forever plan. This gives folks a chance to try things like multiple event types or automated workflows. 

Behavioral psych finds that people value things they own *a lot more* than things they don't.

"Some (unsolicited) GTM predictions for 2026:

1. What ChatGPT says about your product becomes the top product marketing KPI. 

It’s seen as the most “objective” source about why you’re better (or worse) than alternatives. Exec teams obsess over it.

2. Tech companies go on a buying spree for media & community assets. 

We saw a wave of this in 2021-2022. HubSpot & The Hustle. Pendo & Mind the Product. Semrush & Backlinko. 

The rationale back then was SEO. The rationale now will be AEO. (Plus media brands have always been >> than software at building an organic audience. Software is >> at monetizing an audience.)

3. PLG loses its appeal (again) as AI companies shift attention upmarket to bigger deals & stickier customers. 

The retention rates on <$50/month AI products are… not great. (I’m trying to be polite.)

4. People stop using automation as a 💪 and prioritize AI that improves *quality* (conversion, CSAT, accuracy). 

Everyone knows AI can make companies more efficient. But can it improve performance?

5. Direct mail/gifting comes back in style as a way to reach buyers.

People are back in the office. A thoughtful gift gets opened & remembered more than 10 automated emails. 

6. Competitive differentiation becomes the top Board level priority. 

This might not have mattered much when there was so much market pull for AI. But deals will increasingly become a knife fight. Too many AI products still sound & look the same, and buyers don’t know how to decide.

"What's the right go-to-market (GTM) motion for your product? ⤵️

When you look at a table like this (from the brilliant Maja Voje), GTM looks pretty straightforward. There are 7 main types of motions. You just need to figure out what's best for your product & scale it.

The reality is that GTM in 2025 is a bit of a 🗑️🔥. The tried-and-true channels don't work like before (👋 blogs, SEO, outbound emails). New channels aren't totally proven or are hard to scale (👋 AEO). And now we're supposed to figure out how to do this & master AI at the same time (😭). 

I want to bring objective data to the conversation. Real insights from real tech companies. And real nerds crunching the numbers (that's me!).

🚨 Introducing the first annual State of GTM survey, a collab between Growth Unhinged and Go-To-Market Strategist! 

Please take the survey here: https://lnkd.in/ecdQAyFJ

The survey is ~7 mins according to Typeform. All data will be anonymized & reported on an aggregate level. And results will come out in October.

"We're shifting away from charging for access to software and toward charging for the *work delivered* by software & AI agents. But this doesn't mean everything will become pay-as-you-go overnight!

If you're thinking about charging for work, consider these 8 ways to structure your pricing. (I like #6 the best.)

1️⃣ Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)

 - No commit, totally flexible 
 - Enterprise procurement usually *hates* this!
 - Works best when your customers can bill-back the expense or bake it into an operating budget
 - Otherwise, beware of the taximeter effect

2️⃣ PAYG with a cap

 - Caps the usage/spend to offer buyers peace of mind
 - Increasingly seen with outcome-based models where outcomes are unknown

3️⃣ & 4️⃣Usage-based tiers

 - Customers commit to a certain level of usage or tier (ex: up to 5,000 API calls per month); this is typically ""use it or lose it""
 - Two sub-flavors: high watermark (if usage exceeds the plan, folks immediately go into overages) or annual drawdown* (usage can be consumed flexibly, like a gift card)
 - Fear of overages + usage fluctuations encourages sales to over-sell & customers to over-buy

*I personally like the drawdown model. It gives the customer plenty of time to monitor adoption & plan for an early renewal/upgrade if usage is trending above their commit!

5️⃣ Platform fee + usage

 - Small level of commit helps 'lock customers in' and give them access to advanced features, support, etc.
 - Works well when the usage metric is getting commoditized (ex: SMS messages, compute, storage) -- you can advertise a low usage fee & make up for it with the subscription fee

6️⃣ Platform fee (includes usage) + usage, aka three-part tariff

 - Similar to the above, but with a larger subscription fee that includes some level of usage ""included""
 - Folks usually advertise the initial usage as a gift (""get your first 500 SMS messages for free!"")
 - Including a min level of usage helps get the customer hooked & usually incentivizes more overall consumption

7️⃣ Adaptive flat rate

 - The customer commits to a usage-based subscription, but can use the product as much as they want with no overages/upgrades during that period
 - Their tier resets up/down at renewal based on their actual usage behavior
 - Much more predictable for customers while encouraging them to increase consumption (downside is that you could be stuck with the costs!)

8️⃣ Platform plus success bonus

 - Communicate price as a subscription
 - If the customer gets a better ROI than expected, they pay a bonus
 - Works best if success = a hard ROI (ideally tied to extra revenue!)

--

I suspect most folks will offer multiple options as they seek to balance lands, expands & tough procurement convos. The downside: complexity.

"2025 will be remembered as the year when seemingly everybody lost confidence in their pricing. Among the top 500 players in SaaS and AI with transparent pricing, there were more than 1,800 pricing changes in 2025 alone.

That’s a staggering 3.6 pricing changes per company. Some, like Lovable, made a meaningful pricing change every 👏 single 👏 month in 2025.

I enlisted help from Rob Litterst, co-founder of pricing intelligence platform PricingSaaS, to give readers a tactical rundown of what happened and what (if anything) seems to be working in SaaS pricing.

Here's the TL;DR. Read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eptCbRBz

Trend 1: Credit models exploded in popularity, up 126% YoY

Most credits models fall into one of four buckets based on this 2x2: (a) is it more customer-friendly or vendor-friendly? & (b) are credits cost-based or value-based?

 - AI credits as product feature (see: HubSpot, Adobe)
 - AI credits as a creative sandbox (see: Lovable, Replit)
 - AI credits as enterprise infra (see: Figma, Cursor)
 - AI credits as a pass-through utility (see: Clay, PostHog)

Trend 2: The great re-bundling of AI

The more credit models flood the marketplace, the more customers will want to return to simplicity. In 2025 the pendulum swung toward credits. In 2026 it'll likely swing back toward simplicity and predictability.

Some of the biggest names in SaaS -- including Notion, Slack & Loom -- launched their first AI product as an add-on, and have since bundled that functionality into their core pricing model. Each had charged between $4 to $10 per user for an AI add-on. Now they're bundling AI and raising prices by between $2.50 and $5 per user.

Trend 3: Making seat-based pricing work harder

As companies introduce more complex pricing models, seats look customer-friendly by comparison.

Companies doing this well are layering additional value dimensions on top of the seat. Instead of a seat being just permission to log in, a seat becomes a gateway to more product capability, more automation, more consumption, more outcomes, or more flexibility.

Trend 4: The emergence of choose-your-own-pricing

For the past decade, vendors held most of the leverage: long-term contracts, rigid license models, and extractive pricing practices were staples of the legacy playbook. 

AI breaks that model. The demand for optionality is reshaping how SaaS companies think about pricing.

"The latest in AI pricing: credits are becoming the standard.

 - Microsoft announced AI credits for Copilot in M365 in January
 - Salesforce added an AI credit-based model in May
 - Cursor shifted to credit-based pricing in June
 - OpenAI recently replaced seats w/ pooled credits for its Enterprise plans

I suspect *most* AI spend is probably now in the form of credits, which are also referred to as tokens, AI units, generative credits and flex credits. Clay is a great example (see below) & software founders increasingly tell me their pricing was inspired by Clay.

While none of the big players are the first to introduce it, they’ll make it *much easier* for the next company to sell AI credits. Why:

1. Large incumbents validate that it's a 'standard' way to buy AI apps

2. Salesforce, OpenAI & others will educate the market about how to buy credits (won't those be fun procurement convos!)

3. Presumably, large incumbents are making these moves after extensive research w/ customers -- indicating that a lack of predictability isn't an insurmountable roadblock

In today's Growth Unhinged I unpacked why everyone's switching to AI credits & how to do it yourself. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/edDCXget

The TL;DR: Honestly, I’m torn about credits. I can’t imagine the headache of managing dozens of AI products that all have credit allowances. But for now AI credits can be a lifeline -- just not the endgame.

"Churn isn't a Customer Success problem. It’s a *business* problem. And it might be why you miss the 2026 plan. 

Just look at the 3-year ARR impact of different growth initiatives^ for a typical $10M ARR SaaS co:

 - Increase prices by 50% for existing customers: +$1.7M ARR 🙂 
 - Increase prices by 50% for *new* customers: +$5.4M ARR 😃 
 - Increase acquisition by 50%: +$5.4M ARR 😃
 - Increase prices by 50% for both: +$7.1M ARR 😁 
 - Reduce churn by 50%: +$8.9M ARR 🤯

Of course, CS teams are on the front lines working with customers. But there's only so much they can do & they're busy creating value in a bunch of other ways: CSAT & referrals, identifying expansion opps, customer insights.

What *can* prevent churn:

1️⃣ Sell to the right customer.

I've seen products where annualized retention can range from 50% to 90%+ across different types of customers. Selling to the right ICP who values your product is often the top change that moves the needle.

2️⃣ Stop overselling on the 1st deal.

It's usually better to start smaller, prove value quickly, and then unlock growth opportunities in the future. This also leads to faster sales cycles.

3️⃣ Market to your customers.

Marketing isn't only for prospects. Your existing customers should hear about the latest features, learn best practices and get connected to a peer community.

4️⃣ Nail onboarding.

A surprising % of folks who churn never really effectively launched in the first place. (This is especially true for PLG/self-serve).

5️⃣ Set up integrations.

When your product is embedded in the customer's workflow & other systems, it's hard to rip-and-replace. Three reasons why: (a) connected data, (b) easier user adoption, (c) use case expansion.

6️⃣ Solve more problems.

By broadening use cases for your product, you get more champions who'll go to bat for you at renewal (which is especially important if your original buyer leaves). 

7️⃣ Give yourself more time.

Moving from monthly to annual (or multi-year) plans can be controversial. But IMO you're usually better off because you have more time to impress the customer & the customer is more motivated to implement the product.

Every team has a role to play in preventing churn.

"What I believe about how to make money from AI:

1. SaaS pricing used to be kinda boring. But the old playbook doesn't work for AI products.

AI companies can't afford to make pricing a 'future me' decision. The best LLMs are still fairly expensive. Token volume is exploding. And the top 10% of your customers might account for 70-80% of your costs!

And AI startups can't copy the big players. Even giants like Salesforce, OpenAI & Cursor are scrambling to adapt pricing models for AI.

2. Buying models are evolving from ""owning"" to ""hiring"". And how you charge impacts how much customers will pay.

Consider how you paid for your last car ride. You might've bought a car (on-prem), leased a car (subscription), rented one (usage-based), called an Uber (outcome-based), or hired a chauffer (service-as-software). The old models don't fully go away. But customers get more options & the market expands.

Each phase unlocked pricing power. We didn't pay less for SaaS; we paid less upfront & more over time if products delivered. 

Success-based pricing models can capture 25%+ of the economic value the products create because a) they take on risk & b) they tap into new budgets.

3. There are more flavors of AI pricing than you think. Study them. 

And avoid flat fees or seat-based pricing unless you have the margins to support them.

4. The big $$ opportunity is value-based pricing. AI credits are a bridge.

Remember MoviePass? They've been resurrected w/ higher prices & a new credit model. AI companies are doing the exact same thing.

Hybrid pricing models -- usually a mix of per-seat pricing + AI credits -- have exploded from 27% to 41% adoption. These are great for now. But your buyer doesn't want to manage 20+ vendors that all sell credits. 

5. Build with pricing agility in mind right now.

Your pricing will need to change. Plan for it. 

What that means: a) someone needs to own it, b) you need a modern tech stack w/ the flexibility to adjust models & c) you need to talk to your customers about pricing & value.

---

The TL;DR: the AI boom will be the AI bust unless we can turn AI products into great AI businesses. Pricing is your path to AI growth.

"The AI growth re-acceleration at Intercom is wild: 

1. Fin went $1 to $12 million in a year -- more than a year ago.
2. On track to cross 30k paying customers by end of year.
3. Annualized growth is 393% (as of Jun '25).
4. New customer NRR increased from 112% to 146%.
5. AI resolution rates increased from 23% (May '23) to 67% (Nov '25).

My top five takeaways from Des. Listen to the full podcast here: https://lnkd.in/edWkdZgV

1. Every marketing channel that would've worked in the early days of Intercom has gotten harder.

Most things are a lot easier now, except for getting attention. My favorite quote: ""Every legitimate channel has been growth hacked to shit.""

2. There's a classic pattern: People will expand marketing channels until they become slop.

All else being equal, the extra blog post or extra email gets more visits. But at the silent cost of degrading your brand and eroding trust.

3. Marketing is shifting to IRL events like dinners and meetups.

""We find ourselves looking for things that are obviously authentic and aren't hackable."" Events are one of the rare channels that can't be easily faked.

4. Everyone's AI product has the same messaging. And the UI looks the same, too. Competitive differentiation is the next battlefield.

The real test is how many customers (a) discovered the product organically, (b) are happy with the decision, & (c) are seeing real business impact.

5. Pricing is a type of marketing. Startups always need to leave something on the table.

Every pricing model is imperfect.

"Emerging trends I'm noticing around startup GTM hiring:

1️⃣ Fewer management layers of *people*

Even senior hires are player-coaches who do their share of IC work.

2️⃣ More management layers of *AI agents*

Each team member will have their own ""org chart"" consisting of a mix of AI agents, contractors, advisors and (maybe) full-time hires. 

3️⃣ Hiring fewer, but high agency people

There's a premium on former founders or folks w/ side hustles -- people who are used to tackling unfamiliar challenges. These folks all need to be 'high context' so they can make decisions independently. 

4️⃣ Generalists over specialists

A marketer might own content & paid. Or community & partnerships. Or product launches & demand gen. A GTM hire might look more like a 'GTM engineer' doing a mix of pipeline generation, RevOps and growth.

5️⃣ Premium on product, domain and/or technical knowledge 

The rationale: these skills allow folks to a) deeply understand users, b) build community & content that resonates, c) automate what they're doing so they can take on more. 

This is coming even to GTM roles where it didn't used to matter.

"New: When folks are most likely to convert from trial-to-paid. It’s even earlier than I thought 👀 

And it’s one of the best pieces of evidence I've seen in support of reverse trials.

For B2B SaaS companies, about 5% of new trialists convert from free-to-paid within 6 months. (In B2C, it's closer to 20%.)

Of these conversions:
 - HALF (!) happen within the first 7 days
 - 70% happen within the first 14 days
 - 90% happen within the first month
 - But only about 3% happen in months 3-6

The data comes from my friends at ChartMogul who looked at the GTM and conversion data of 2,500+ SaaS companies.

Look, the immediate takeaway of this data is that you have a very narrow window to impress trial users. Usually within the first week -- if not sooner.

My two cents about what to do with this data: re-engage signups post-trial! 

1. Consider a 'reverse trial' -- letting folks downgrade to a freemium plan if they don't convert within the trial period.

Why? This gives users more time to see value. It then creates additional conversion opportunities over time: users hit a CTA in the product, they run into a feature gate, they trip a usage limit. And they can become product-qualified leads for the sales team.

In my recent State of B2B Monetization survey, still only 4% of software companies have a reverse trial. That's about one-tenth the rate of free trial/freemium.

2. Auto-extend free trials for accounts who reached an 'aha moment' but didn't buy.

Why? In my experience, about 25-40% of new signups reach an 'aha moment' within their first week. But this data shows only about 5% of folks are buying. That leaves 20-35% of signups reaching and 'aha moment' and NOT buying!

Depending on user signals, you could take a 'smart trial' approach to either (a) enforcing the trial time-limit, (b) extending the trial period and/or (c) collecting data on why they've decided not to buy. 

3. Periodically re-open trial windows, especially around major milestones like new product releases or events.

Why? Your product is constantly improving. Make sure lapsed trial users see that and have a chance to experience it firsthand!

It's a cool report, I'll drop the link in the comments.

"Some of the most fascinating AI outcome-based pricing examples so far:

1. Intercom (per successful resolution)
2. EvenUp (per demand package or medical chronology)
3. CaseMark (per legal deliverable)
4. Chargeflow (25% per recovered chargeback)
5. Sierra (per completed task)
6. Zendesk (per automated resolution)
7. Decagon (option of per resolution or per conversation)
8. Crescendo (pay per resolution)
9. Maven AGI (only pay for resolutions)
10. Flycode (only pay for revenue recovered above baseline)
11. Redux Payments (only pay for revenue they add)
12. AirHelp (35% success fee)
13. SmarterDx (only gets paid when hospitals make $$ incrementally)

The interest in outcome-based pricing models is unlike anything I’ve seen. 

Look, I love outcome-based pricing -- in theory. It feels like the ultimate win-win. Will we get there? There's a (big) elephant in the room, which I’m calling the CAMP framework. 

To pull off outcome-based pricing, you need four things:
- Consistency of outcomes across customer types
- Attribution for those outcomes
- Measurability, ideally in real-time
- Predictability of outcomes

Without CAMP, outcome-based pricing is just hype. I'll be following along to see how the first-movers navigate this 👀

"Software founders used to tell me their pricing was inspired by Salesforce or maybe Slack. Now they tell me they were inspired by Intercom, HubSpot, OpenAI and Clay.*

What folks love about each:

1. Intercom: Outcome-based pricing pioneer, charging $0.99 per AI resolution (Fin). 

But, really, it's a hybrid model. Intercom charges per seat for its helpdesk and for its AI copilot.

2. HubSpot: Famously introduced contact-based pricing a decade ago. It more than paid off.

Today, HubSpot is known for balancing self-serve & enterprise, successfully going multi-product (several times over) & being far more transparent than other folks.

3. OpenAI: Set the reference price for AI products (and the cost for AI tokens). 

Increasingly, folks are watching OpenAI's evolution from unlimited/flat rates to hybrid pricing and from $20/seat to $200+ for its most advanced AI.

4. Clay: Early adopter of hybrid pricing, combining subscription packages with credits.

I'm not the biggest fan of copying pricing. But there's a lot to learn from these folks.

"GTM Engineers went from non-existent to the most talked about role of 2025. OpenAI, Ramp, Webflow & more are hiring for it. But it turns out it’s not as popular as it seems.

GTM engineers are meant to bring technology and automation to solve hard GTM problems (of which there are many!). I think of GTM engineers as people who can both identify friction points across the buying journey (ICP targeting, ICP pipeline, conversion, CAC, etc.) and then quickly run automated, 1:many experiments to eliminate them.

It’s essentially a growth hire, but focused on a primarily sales-led or sales-assisted funnel rather than a product-led one.

Despite the buzz, I haven’t met many actual GTM engineers yet. There really aren’t a lot of software companies hiring for GTM engineers, either.

Here's what the data shows (see it for yourself here: https://lnkd.in/ezfJ_JJf)

1. There were 128 GTM Engineer jobs posted in the last 3 months. 

Sounds like a lot, but that's 1 for every 14 in RevOps. 1 for every 35 in SalesOps. And 1 for every 92 SDRs (!) -- which nobody is calling a hot job.

2. 45% of those with a GTM engineer title are actually agencies or consultants (shoutout to Amos Bar-Joseph). 

3. The role’s popularity is a far cry from other AI-native jobs like AI engineers, prompt engineers or automation engineers. In fact, it barely registers in Google Trends.

---

Before hiring a GTM engineer, I’d suggest you:

 - Start with an agency or consultant to prove value with a specific use case
 - Redeploy someone internally who has the business context paired with the system knowledge
 - Upskill the existing GTM team and equip them with next-gen tooling
 - Hire a great Head of RevOps (or RevTech) and fully resource their team

"Introducing my first podcast: Mostly Growth! 🎧 

Mostly Growth is the (mostly) serious podcast for anyone who cares about startup growth.

Like a good millennial, I listen to *a lot* of podcasts. But I struggle to find business podcasts that are both insightful and entertaining. Too many are run-of-the-mill interviews with a rotating cast of the same dozen guests repeating their talking points.

The Mostly Growth pod is here to change that. It’s myself, my favorite CFO CJ Gustafson (from Mostly Metrics), and producer Ben Hillman unpacking the most interesting happenings in tech and startups.

A taste of what we jammed on this week:
➡️ Is T2D3 dead?
➡️ SEO's collapse and AEO's rise
➡️ Y-axis crimes of mass proportions (👀 Ramp)
➡️ The brutal job market for new grads
➡️ Hospital bed Linkedin photos
➡️ The story of Bob's Barricades (and his curious pricing model)

You can check it out on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify (links below). Your support would mean the world to us and convince the algorithms we’re legit. 

Hope you enjoy it 🙏🙏

"We're in a new UX era for software: the era of the prompt bar. That doesn't mean you can just add a prompt bar & move on. What 40+ of the best AI-native companies are doing:

I enlisted Yaakov Carno to map out AI prompt journeys across products like Canva, Notion, Vercel, Lovable, Airtable (& lesser known AI companies). He traced every step from homepage to first value. 

The 7 most interesting observations ⤵️

1. Consider offering multiple entry points: the prompt bar OR a visual UX. 

Gamma and Wix are two 🔥 examples. Gamma even has 3 options.

2. Increase relevance with a ""hidden"" step between the prompt bar & output. 

Lovable, for example, has a series of onboarding questions to collect more context.

3. Don’t just tell users they can “generate anything.” Show them specific, meaningful examples that connect to their job-to-be-done. 

Canva, for instance, has a visual use case selector w/ a category & sub-category.

4. Use the prompt bar to educate users about what kind of tasks your product supports. 

Zapier there are sample prompts for lead management, customer support, marketing & growth, and project mgmt.

5. Distinguish whether the AI is a copilot or autopilot. 

Notion nails this with a mix of placeholder text, surrounding CTAs, and examples that clearly convey what you can do and why.

6. Integrate context, data, and sources at the beginning.

bolt.new has a new minimalistic design that focuses only on importing from Figma and GitHub. Constraints increase the likelihood of relevant, valuable outputs.

7. Add a fun factor to make the experience feel different & maybe a bit magical.

Playfulness can lower hesitation. Riff and Leap use “Shuffle” or “Surprise me” icons to encourage exploration.

"ICYMI: For the love of annual planning, please make this chart before you lock in your 2025 targets.

If we’re ever going to find out what works, we need a unified (and account-based) view of go-to-market effectiveness.

It starts with figuring out *exactly* where you stand with your target accounts in real-time. What this means:

1️⃣ You know exactly how many accounts are in your ICP.

2️⃣ You've *identified* the buyers at those accounts and can market to them. 

This is easier than ever with next-gen GTM tooling.

3️⃣ You know how many are *aware* of you. 

They're consistently opening your emails, engaging with your ads, visiting your website, etc.

4️⃣ You know how many are *interested*. 

These prospects are self-educating through interactive demos, signing up for a free account, attending a webinar, or viewing high-intent website pages. (Ideally these become high-intent leads for warm outbound.)

5️⃣ You know how many are *considering* a purchase. 

You can think of these are SQLs within your ICP, but they could be PQLs or self-service team buyers as well.

6️⃣ You know how many are *selecting* a vendor, meaning they're engaging in a buying process. 

This typically translates to proposal stage.

7️⃣ You know how many have chosen your product, becoming a customer. (Of course, you can extend this framework post-purchase, too!)

---

If you look at GTM effectiveness this way, it doesn't matter whether you invest more in AEO, PLG, automated outbound, SEO, paid ads, BDRs/SDRs, memes, or something else entirely.

What matters is that you ultimately reach the right people and turn them into customers.

"Software products are starting to all look the same. Seemingly everyone is putting the prompt box front and center.

It'll be harder & harder to differentiate on the *user* experience. We're going to need to differentiate on the *agent* experience instead.

What I'm seeing from the best products:

1. Product education starts *before* even hitting the website.

With a prompt box UX, the user needs to come to the product already armed with an idea about how to use it. 

Folks are educating users through hackathons, communities, slick launch videos & asking influencers to show off what they've built. Template libraries still work, too. (Half of Lovable's homepage is now devoted to UGC templates.)

2. The product helps you improve your prompt.

Most of us (myself included) aren't prompt engineers. And a garbage prompt can often mean a garbage result -- and not much patience to keep going.

The best products help us clarify our ideas, turning ""meh"" prompts into ""omg"" prompts. I particularly love the one-click ""enhance prompt"" feature in products like bolt.new and Replit.

3. The agentic UX isn't one-and-done.

The UX shouldn't just complete the task and move on. The best agentic experiences recommend next steps & help you do them. 

They can also become the best sales rep for the product: proactively encouraging you to upgrade & then suggesting the plan that's best for you. After all, helping was always the best way of selling.

4. The agent isn't a black box.

The best tools include a preview mode & give users the ability to edit what AI produces. 

It's not just a ""do it for me"" experience, it's a ""do it with me"" experience that leads to an outcome people feel great about.

The innovation isn't putting a prompt box in the app. It's creating an agentic UX that (finally) feels personal & maybe a bit magical.

"Fascinating new data from a16z on how CIOs want to buy AI apps:

1. CIOs now *prefer* usage-based models. 

So much for usage-based pricing being seen as a barrier to adoption 🤷‍♂️

My two cents: most AI spend w/ the CIO is on LLMs and compute. Both are usage-based categories where folks have become accustomed to granular pricing and not buying shelfware. 

With usage-based models, there’s also a connotation that prices will come down over time as vendors compete. Avoid picking a pricing metric that positions your app as a commodity w/o differentiation!

2. Seat-based models aren’t the key to unlocking budget. 

Only 21% said seat-based pricing was their preferred model. That’s slightly less than hybrid models (23%) even though hybrid models are inherently more complicated with more risk of overages/extra fees.

My two cents: buying in a way that reflects the value received is >>> than having perfect budget certainty/predictability. And flexibility matters as folks are finding which AI apps are “experiments” vs ready for “production”. 

3. There’s a lot of work to educate CIOs about how to pay for outcomes.

15% said outcome-based models are their preferred way to buy — although that’s still significant considering only *5% of companies* have outcome-based pricing today (based on the 2025 State of B2B Monetization report)! We’re still in the early innings. 

Among the concerns CIOs raised: (1) lack of clear, measurable outcomes for most products - 47%, (2) unpredictable or unscalabe costs - 36%, (3) difficulty with attribution to a specific tool - 25%. 

My two cents: I suspect line of business is much more open to outcome-based pricing than the CIO — after all, the CRO and the CMO are measured based on outcomes, too! But if you’re thinking about outcome-based pricing, you need outcome consistency, attribution, measurability and predictability (CAMP).

"A few weeks ago I shared data that most SaaS startups never make it. Just 3.5% reach $20 million in ARR within ten years of monetizing, worse odds than getting into Harvard. What makes those outliers different ⤵️

I investigated new data from ChartMogul, the SaaS metrics & growth platform where I'm an Analyst-in-Residence. Their dataset covers 6,525 software companies with historical data going back 10+ years.

What I found surprised me. The winners didn’t necessarily *start* better. They *became* better, reinventing their startups from $1M to $20M ARR.

The four key takeaways you need to know:

1. Interestingly, starting metrics at $1M ARR were pretty similar for the companies that made it to $20M & those who stalled out.

The main difference was MoM growth rate. Outliers were growing 16.7% MoM on average; others were growing 8.7%. But even this wasn’t as pronounced as it appears. 

The top quartile of those who *didn't* make it outpaced more than half of the outliers. Clearly, starting momentum isn't the only factor at play.

2. The outliers were meaningfully better at improving their growth metrics compared to everyone else.

Few managed to accelerate growth rates. But the majority got better at everything else including:

 - Average revenue per account: 72% improved by more than 10%
 - Share of MRR on annual plans: 71% improved by more than 10%
 - Gross revenue retention: 51% improved by more than 10%
 - Net revenue retention: 45% improved by more than 10%

3. Outliers raised prices, increasing avg revenue per account by 82% (!) from $1 to $20M. This was 20 pts better than others.

There are many paths to a higher revenue per account. The common denominator is to increase perceived value over time while simultaneously monetizing that extra value.

4. Outliers got better at expanding their customers with NRR increasing by about 10 percentage points. This was 6 pts better than others, which compounds year after year.

A major driver of this is shifting from single product to multi-product, allowing for more surface area to expand customers.

"Introducing the 2025 GTM scorecard, just in time for annual planning ⤵️ 

Maja and I surveyed 195 B2B leaders about which GTM channels are working right now. We then mapped how popular different GTM channels are (x-axis) versus how likely they are to be impactful among adopters (y-axis).

The shorthand for interpreting this two-by-two:
1. Tried-and-true (upper right)
2. Oversaturated (lower right)
3. The next big thing (upper left)
4. Figuring it out (lower left)

I then cut the data for startups (<$10M ARR) vs. scaleups (>$10M ARR) & it's fascinating to see how the channels shift.

The best channels for startups*:
 - LinkedIn (#1)
 - Founder brand (#2)
 - Warm outbound (#3)
 - Intent-based outbound (#4)
 - Intimate events (#5)

*The magic tends to happen when you can combine these channels into a cohesive strategy, i.e. founder brand + LinkedIn + warm outbound & intimate events for those who engage.

The best channels for scaleups*:
 - Large conferences (#1)
 - SEO (#2)
 - Intimate events (#3)
 - Big product launches (#4)
 - Ecosystem marketing (#5)

*Scaleups are still seeing returns from their years of SEO investments. The question is whether they can translate their SEO into AI discovery or if they'll be leap-frogged by new entrants.

The TL;DR: No matter what stage you're at, you might want to plan for more intimate events (dinners, happy hours, etc.) next year. They're not the most scalable, but they're one of the few things that seems to work.

"Yesterday, ChatGPT hit 2.5 BILLION (🤯) prompts per day, up from 1 billion in December. It's quickly approaching Google's 14 billion daily searches. Getting recommended by AI engines is no longer just a weekend side project (*guilty*).

Josh Blyskal from Profound analyzed data from 100,000 prompts to figure out how these AI engines actually work. Here are nine practical takeaways that you could start applying now to improve your AI search visibility:

(Don't miss the full deep dive in today's Growth Unhinged newsletter: https://lnkd.in/e2GdwgNN)

1. Decide which prompts you want to own.

2. Be aware that answer engines behave differently. ChatGPT & Perplexity share only 11% of domain citations. 

3. Write specialized, specific content. 

4. Create surround sound around your product. The best starting points are UGC & social media sites like Reddit, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Quora.

5. Get mentioned on Reddit. It's the single most-cited domain in ChatGPT & Perplexity. 

6. Use structured comparisons and lists. Remember that ChatGPT loves to ""borrow"" entire answers in chunks rather than do the thinking itself.

7. Make fewer images and more tables. AI engines can't see images well.

8. Measure your influence, not just clicks. The vast majority of AI search is zero-click (but it can still be highly influential.)

9. Stay on top of citation drift. Half of domains cited change in a given month.

"I’ve worked with 100+ software companies on monetization. What I really think of your pricing model:

Flat-fee pricing: 🥱
Feature-based: 😈 
Seat-based: 🦖
Usage-based: 🎢 
Hybrid pricing: 🤓 
Outcome-based: ❄️ 

Your pricing is (probably) broken. Just like everyone else. But don’t abandon your pricing, fix it. 

Full deep dive in today’s Growth Unhinged newsletter (with tactical examples of what to do): https://lnkd.in/eWhsq4Rq

Ok, ready for the pricing roast?!?

1. Flat-fee pricing: Don’t expect to make $$

- Small companies get priced out
- Large companies pay too little
- There’s no expansion revenue
- High potential for low/negative margin customers

2. Feature-based: Bundle hell

- Almost everyone defaults to the middle tier
- The plans are arbitrary and confusing
- Everyone wants to pick-and-choose
- New features throw your plans into a tailspin

3. Seat-based: Isn’t that a dinosaur?

- Companies are cutting heads with AI, meaning less seat $$
- The value of AI agents doesn’t scale with buying more seats
- Not all users are the same. Why should they pay the same for a seat?
- Puts a cap on potential $$ of an account

4. Usage-based: TradCFOs hate it

- It’s too hard to forecast
- Not all usage = ROI for the customer
- Customers self-police their usage, hurting long-term growth
- There’s not a clear usage metric that correlates with value

5. Hybrid pricing: I’m gonna need a PhD to figure out how much this costs 

- There’s way too much complexity
- It’s impossible to calculate costs
- Too hard to manage (quoting, billing, UX, etc.)
- Feels like a bait-and-switch

6. Outcome-based: It’s a pipe dream 

- Measuring outcomes feels impossible
- Customers fight over the bill
- Impossible to estimate outcomes upfront
- You don’t get credit for anything beyond one specific outcome

There is no such thing as a perfect pricing model. 

The best you can do is to choose the pricing model that allows you to tell the unique story of what you do, who you’re for, and why you’re better than the alternative. And have a plan to manage the inevitable downsides.

"Fyxer was a sleepy virtual EA firm from 2016-2022. Then they pivoted to AI, aspiring to be Cursor for email. And growth has since *exploded* — from $1 to $17M ARR in the last 8 months.

Some quick stats on Fyxer AI:
👉 Founded & run by two brothers, Archie and Richard.
👉 Raised a $10M Series A led by Harry at 20VC with backing from Marc Benioff & Lenny. Then raised a $30M Series B led by Madrona only 6 months later.
👉 This is real ARR -- 90% of paying users stick around >3 months & net revenue retention (NRR) is 150%+ in most cohorts (🤯).

Today's Growth Unhinged unpacks how they did it. Read the story here: https://lnkd.in/ejF7Vxte

Fyxer's consumer to enterprise AI expansion playbook in 5 steps:

Step 1: Make the product dead simple for everyday people.

The onboarding process feels almost non-existent; once you’ve integrated your calendar, it's essentially ready to go. 

There are no complicated shortcuts. But you can easily adapt it to your preferences by toggling a slider or adding a few extra sentences to the style prompt.

Step 2: Turn to influencers to get initial traction.

From zero to $1M ARR, Fyxer’s biggest growth lever was definitively non-sexy. It was Archie sliding into DMs and begging people to post on LinkedIn. 

Each influencer post attracted about 20-30 new signups. (Btw, there wasn’t much correlation between an influencer’s size and their impact.)

Step 3: Go big with consumer performance marketing.

Performance marketing now drives about half of Fyxer’s new growth. 

Their ad cadence is relentless. Two-week sprints, 200+ ads live at any given moment, 100-150 new creative variations every sprint. This is powered by (lots) of AI tools incl. ChatGPT, Claude, ReelFarm, Arcads AI, ElevenLabs, HeyGen, Synthesia, Motion & Getdot.ai. 

Step 4: Refine GTM around business users and enterprise expansion.

Work email signups are worth 10x more than personal emails. The top KPI for performance marketing: cost-per-work-email.

Step 5: Continuously improve AI and reactivate users along the way.

One of the biggest reasons why initial Fyxer signups didn’t convert was that the AI wasn’t quite good enough yet. The next unlock is re-activating these users. They're doing it with trial re-starts & a human-seeming email “from” a founder (Archie in particular).

"Something I'm digging about credits: Using them to gamify onboarding 😍

It's like Dropbox's famous ""get free storage space by inviting your friends"", but modernized for the AI era.

Steal this example from the crew at Apollo. 

Users get credits for (a) completing key onboarding steps, (b) watching tutorials & videos on advanced features, and even (c) inviting friends/colleagues to sign up.

Then credits can be spent on, well, anything. Data (phone numbers, emails), enrichment, AI power-ups, etc. 

It's a cool way to turn credits from a frustration into powerful growth lever.

"Kyle Poyar just analyzed new data from 6,525 SaaS startups and it's WILD. Only 3.3% reach $1 million ARR in less than a year from first revenue. And just 1-in-1000 reach $10 million in less than a year!!

Thats not what you'd think if you only listen to VCs on Twitter.

You'd think if you're not at $100M ARR in 6 months you might as well give up.

Kyle partnered with ChartMogul and dug into their dataset on subscription metrics going back 10+ years and here's what he found: 

For startups that reach $1M ARR, it usually takes 2-5 years from monetization. 

1. Only 3.3% of startups reach $1 million in under 1 year
2. 13.4% reach $1 million in under 3 years
3. 25.1% reach that figure within 5 years

You can map yourself onto the curve below (see graphic). 

It takes time to find PMF and move from founder-led sales to repeatable growth. And premature scaling can kill a great business. 

That's why many of the best companies started slow:

- Lovable spent 18 months building before their breakthrough success
- Clay grinded for 6 years before seeing revenue traction
- Bolt spent 7 years to get to $700k ARR before their new product exploded

Tomorrow Kyle (Founder of Growth Unhinged) is joining me on Unf*ck My Startup LIVE to share the realistic playbook for sustainable startup growth.

If you're a founder feeling discouraged by hyper-growth narratives, this session will provide the data-driven clarity and actionable strategies you need to build a long-term, successful startup.

Introducing Virio — the world’s first AI marketer for enterprise.

As a teen I built content that did 1B+ views/month…

That is when I learned the hard truth:
Views ≠ Pipeline
Likes ≠ Revenue

I realized the problem wasn’t creating attention..
It was turning that attention into revenue.

They're both playing high-stakes games with their bodies - but only one group typically treats it that way.

The professional athlete knows they're playing a different game than everyone else.

The retiree needs to realize they're playing a different game than their younger self.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:
Professional athletes succeed because they:
• Intensify their focus on their body
• Build a support team (trainers, coaches, nutritionists)
• Create intentional daily routines
• Never take their physical condition for granted

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸:
I see it constantly - successful professionals entering retirement like they're still their 25-year-old selves. After 30+ years of desk work, long flights, and minimal movement, they're shocked when their body doesn't cooperate.

The most frustrated? Former athletes.
I watch former Division 1 college athletes struggle with basic golf, pickleball, and tennis games. Their frustration isn't just about the sport - it's about losing their identity as ""the athletic one.""

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲:
Just like a pro athlete's training isn't always fun, preparing for a healthy retirement requires dedicated work. You can't neglect your health for decades and expect it to magically improve when you have more free time.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻:
1. Start 𝘣𝘦𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘦 retirement - your future self will thank you
2. Get a realistic assessment of your current health
3. Build your support team (doctor, trainer, physical therapist)
4. Create sustainable daily routines

"🚀 Today we’re launching Lariat - an AI-native prospecting platform built specifically for selling into brick-and-mortar businesses.🚀

Anyone who’s sold into industries like restaurants, construction, or manufacturing has felt the pain of wasting hours on manual research, being unable to easily pre-qualify accounts, and dealing with stale contact lists.

That’s because 90% of brick-and-mortar decision-makers are completely invisible to traditional sales platforms. They don’t have Linkedin profiles, they don’t use work emails, and their buying signals are not captured at all in existing intent tools.

Our AI agents work 24/7 to find that missing 90% – reading regulatory filings, analyzing images, making phone calls, and extracting intelligence from sources others can't reach.

We've been working quietly over the last year with some customers in select industries -  and now we’re available for any industry.

Today, you can log in to Lariat, write a sentence like “owners of fast casual Mexican restaurants that serve alcohol and have added new locations recently” and get the perfect prospecting list built in about 3 seconds.

To make this possible, we had to rebuild the entire data stack from the ground up around physical locations as the starting point. We created new classification systems for businesses that actually matter to sellers, new ways to map the complex ownership structure behind multi-location businesses, and a fleet of custom AI agents that can continuously discover and validate decision-makers and their contact information.

Our vision is a world where our physical-world intelligence combines with your internal platform data, AI orchestrates who to call and when, so sellers can focus on what humans do best: actually selling.

If we’re successful - everyone wins. Spam cannons are traded in for truly relevant outreach, and buyers can cut through the noise.

For too long, GTM teams selling into brick-and-mortar have been stuck with broken tools - let's put an end to that starting today. 

If you're on one of those teams (or know someone who is), come check us out - link in comments.",122,24,13,,,Teacher,GTM/Sales,Data/Numbers,Story → Twist → Lesson,Text-only,🚀 Today we’re launching Lariat - an AI-native prospecting platform built specifically for selling into brick-and-mortar businesses.🚀,"🚀 Today we’re launching Lariat - an AI-native prospecting platform built specifically for selling into brick-and-mortar businesses.🚀

"New Research Alert: The role of the data analyst is evolving—and AI is leading the charge.  

Alteryx’s latest global research report, ""The 2025 State of Data Analysts in the Age of AI,"" reveals key insights shaping the future of analytics. Here’s what we found after surveying 1,400 data professionals across five industries: 
 
✔️ Strategic impact increasing – 94% agree their role influences strategic decisions, and 87% report greater business impact in recent years. 
✔️ AI boosts productivity – 7 out of 10 analysts say AI and automation make them more effective.  
✔️ Spreadsheet dependency persists – 76% still rely on spreadsheets for data prep, with nearly half spending 6+ hours weekly on manual data cleaning.  
 
While analysts feel optimistic about the opportunities AI presents, the reliance on spreadsheets could threaten data quality and AI outcomes.  

Want to know how AI is transforming the analyst role—and how to stay ahead?

"The role of the CFO is transforming faster than ever and next week’s Millenium Alliance C-Suite Assembly is shaping up to be a front-row look at how finance leaders are navigating the AI shift.

I’ll be onsite in Charlotte on Dec. 4–5 as Alteryx's CEO Andy MacMillan and CFO Jon Pexton share their perspective on what modern FinOps really requires today.

Their session, “Do You Think or Do You Know? Accelerating FinOps in the Age of Intelligence,” will explore a challenge I hear from finance teams every day: how to move beyond hindsight reporting to real-time, data-driven decisioning grounded in trusted data, automation, and strong governance.

If you’ll be there, make sure to catch it on Dec. 4 at 3:35 p.m. It’s a great opportunity to hear how leading CFOs are reshaping their operating models for speed, clarity, and confidence.

Shoot me a message if you're planning on attending— I'm looking forward to connecting with peers across the C-suite!

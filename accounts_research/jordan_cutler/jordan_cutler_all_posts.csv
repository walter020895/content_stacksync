"I'm thrilled to share that I've been promoted to Staff Software Engineer at Pinterest!

Working at Pinterest has been such a rewarding experience. I've grown so much since joining, and I'm grateful for my team (Web Platform) and org (Client Foundations) for creating an environment that makes it easy for that to happen.

"Your manager asks you to delegate more work to other engineers so you can scale yourself. What do you do?

Here's the simplest way to remember: think about each piece of work you delegate like a one-pager.

One-pagers include:
• Problem
• Goal
• Solution
• Alternatives
• Risks

Start at the top. Always tell them the problem (or the ""why""). Then, continue down the list as far as you'd like, but stop when you're confident the other person can handle the rest.

You can use engineering levels/titles as a rule of thumb, but it doesn't always need to map to that. For example,
• Staff engineer -> stop at ""Problem""
• Senior engineer -> stop at ""Goal""
• Mid-level engineer -> stop at ""Solution""
• Entry/Junior engineer -> cover most or all

When you want to challenge them, stop earlier. Let them take on more and give them that growth opportunity.

This framework covers what level of detail to provide, but of course, there's more to delegation than that. To get all the details, join 95k+ engineers and check my latest article: https://lnkd.in/ea-JjkKA",1071.0,39.0,37,1147.0,4.46,Teacher,Engineering Leadership,Framework/How-To,List Post,Text-only,Your manager asks you to delegate more work to other engineers so you can scale yourself.

"The 5 levels of communicating your impact as an engineer in tech:

Level 1: What you did
Migrated the user authentication system to OAuth 2.0

Level 2: Had impact
...which reduced login failures

Level 3: Specific impact
...by 40% (from 15% to 9%)

Level 4: Tied to a goal
...exceeded our Q2 reliability target by 2x

Level 5: and dollars or top-level business metrics
...and prevented $2.1M in annual revenue loss and saved 15 hours/week in support

If you can include all of these in your self-reviews or resume, it's the strongest impact you can communicate. Still, reaching Level 5 is hard. You might not have all the data to get there, so Level 3-4 is ok too. The key is being as specific as possible with the data you have.

"After landing a $350k offer in big tech, my friend quoted this interview tip as what helped him the most in landing the job.

Don't answer the question. Answer the question BEHIND the question.

Here's an example:

• Interviewer asks... ""Tell me about your biggest failure""
• You respond by telling them about a big project that didn't ship on time and everyone moved on. That feels like a failure, right?

The problem is, the question behind the question was, ""How well do you learn from your big failures?"" So you can still tell the story about your biggest failure, but you need to touch on what you learned from it! Every answer you give uncovers more to the interviewer about how you are to work with (the pie below).

Here are some more examples:
• Biggest disagreement -> Can you work with others? (not a chance to brag about swapping teams due to arguments)
• A project you are proud of -> How large is your scope and do you approach projects methodically?
• A time when you missed a deadline -> Do you let others know ahead of time when your estimate is off? How do you approach your relationship with stakeholders?

Each question has something underlying the interviewer is trying to get at.

Figure out what it is. Answer THAT question and you'll see the offers start coming in.

--
The thing is, this framework isn't just useful for interviews. You can use it when you're fielding questions during a presentation, or when you're dealing with hard questions from your manager on why something hasn't shipped.

"6 Must Have Software Engineering Templates to grow as an engineer:

This week I covered 6 of the templates I use the most as Senior Engineer in Big Tech. Here they are, with links to each one!

1. Technical Design Doc Template: https://lnkd.in/enamp3FW

Use this when your team already agreed you'll work on something, and now you need to sort out ""how"" you're going to build it and what milestones.

2. Feedback Template: https://lnkd.in/ehsuJUkk

Use this to give feedback in a non-judgmental, constructive way to help the other person improve.

3. 1-Pager Proposal Template: https://lnkd.in/eCXRcg-W

Use this when you need to focus more on the ""why"" than the ""how."" It lets you propose an idea to actually get it prioritized.

4. Pull Request Template: https://lnkd.in/et6DTYfv

Use this to clearly describe your changes and get faster reviews by making your reviewers' lives easier.

5. 1-on-1 Template: https://lnkd.in/eg6NcHbe

Use this for more productive for 1:1s and to avoid getting sidetracked.

6. Brag Doc + Weekly Update Template: https://lnkd.in/eFbMgbb7

"3 unspoken git tricks that save you TONS of time (no one else shares these):

1. git checkout -

What does it do? It switches you to your previous branch. Instead of typing it all out, you can just say ""-"".

""git checkout jcutler-my-favorite-branch"" becomes ""git checkout -"". I even have an alias set up for git checkout so it becomes ""gco -""

AND you can extend this with ""git merge -"" to merge the last branch you were on, or ""cd -"" to switch to your previous directory.

2. git bisect

It's the most underrated debugging tool. When something that WAS working starts breaking, run ""git bisect start."" It will use binary search to figure out the exact commit that broke it in lg(n) tries. 

Because it uses binary search, it can find the bad commit across 1000+ commits in just 10 tries.

3. git checkout HEAD@{1.week.ago}

Or more generally, git checkout branchname@{timeframe}. You can use this to supercharge your git bisect skills. When you use ""git bisect"", you need to start by finding a ""good"" and ""bad"" commit. 

You can easily find the good commit by trying different times of the codebase with this trick.

"This one communication shift took my friend from rejections to landing a senior 270k offer in big tech.

❌ Before, he'd get a question like, ""Tell me about how you made an impact on your team.""

And he'd answer like, ""Yeah, there was this one time... < speak for a minute on the story >... oh and there was this other time too... < another one >."" 

But the interviewer would already be lost by the end of the first one. They want someone senior, someone who can take a step back first.

I told him, you need to show your STRUCTURED thought process. Seniors speak in bullet points first, then details after.

✅ So he switched it to, ""Sure. When I'm making impact on the team, I like to think about 3 things--opportunity, effort, and risk. Each quarter, we map projects on these axes and one of the projects I proposed had high opportunity and medium effort/risk. Let me tell you more about that one, why I worked on it, and how I drove it forward...""

Once he switched to this, his interviewer's eyes started lighting up early on in his answer. He finally figured it out. Then, the offers followed.

So why is the second one better?
1. It shows you don't just jump into solutions.
2. It shows your decision criteria for action. You won't work on unimpactful work.
3. It gives your interviewer an overview first, almost like an ""agenda"" at the start of a presentation. They know what to expect.

Before you answer, take a step back, share your thought process, and show your structured thinking. Don't just dive in and start going off on stories.

Recently when working with Torsten Walbaum (ex-Rippling/Uber/Meta Director), I learned there was a framework this relates to called MECE--mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. When it gets applied, it looks a lot like the example my friend used to get his senior offers.

In today's High Growth Engineer post, Torsten shows you how to use it for 5 use cases as an engineer--interviews, investigations, debugging, explaining a system, and when proposing ideas.

Join 80k+ engineers and check it out here: https://lnkd.in/e-MBdkjg",369.0,18.0,13,400.0,1.54,Fortune Teller,Engineering Career,Industry Observation,List Post,Text-only,This one communication shift took my friend from rejections to landing a senior 270k offer in big te,"This one communication shift took my friend from rejections to landing a senior 270k offer in big tech.

"This framework I never knew I needed got me compliments on my communication within a week.

It's called MECE.

Huh? mice? No. MECE 😂. It stands for ""Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive."" It forces your communication to be structured.

Let's take an incident investigation as an example. Many times, engineers are dropping messages in the channel like throwing darts.

❌ Before: ""It could be the landing page. No, that's not it. Maybe seasonality? Nope, that's not it either... anyone have other ideas?""

✅ After: ""If signups are down, it's either actually down or it's a false positive. If it's a false positive, we can check for seasonality or a data issue. If it's an actual drop, it could be that it's iOS only, android only, or both. Let's narrow it down.""

MECE tells you to come up with all the mutually exclusive and many options as possible upfront, then narrow down and cross out. 

This has a few benefits:
1. You can literally SEE the structure via a tree this gives your communication and thinking
2. Once you see it, you can delegate each of those to others working on the issue
3. Finally, you can cross out each item on the tree as you go, and give accurate estimates to leaders of when it'll be resolved. No more, ""we're not sure when it'll be fixed. It's too ambiguous."" 

To apply it yourself, before your next message, think about how you can communicate using a ""tree structure"" like the one on the right. Avoid windy roads and darts.

Have you heard of MECE before and where else do you think you can use it?

"Here's a simple trick to avoid your proposals getting rejected: Don't make it a ""yes"" or ""no"" decision. 

Make it a ""which one"" decision. And make your recommendation the obvious choice.

When you say ""Can I do <x>?"" it's a ""yes"" or ""no"" decision. Most of the time, especially when your request might be to another team, the easiest thing is for them to say no. That keeps the status quo which feels safe.

When you provide options, it makes the best choice for the business clear and easy to pick.

Here's a before and after example.

❌ Before: Can you add rate limiting to the search endpoint? Our frontend is sending too many requests.

✅ After:
Hi team, we're seeing high request volumes on the search endpoint. We have a few options to address this:
1. Backend rate limiting (recommended). All clients will be supported out of the box.
2. Add client side throttling. However, all clients will need to be updated
3. If we do nothing, we'll keep hitting our max load and failing requests

What are your thoughts?

This is a simplified example, but the ""after"" did a few things:
• It reduces cognitive load by calling out ways we can solve it up front
• It makes it really weird to choose option 3. It's clear that (1) or (2) will be better than doing nothing. 
• It makes it really easy to pick option 1. It's already been laid out as recommended and shows why it's the best choice.

Combined, it leads to you getting the outcome you want.

"Big thanks to Jordan Cutler, author of the excellent, widely-read weekly newsletter High Growth Engineer. We teamed up on today's guest post in HGE about storytelling (https://lnkd.in/e-38Pd66).

As you progress in your engineering career, the strong technical skills you've demonstrated won't be enough to get you promoted to the next level. They're necessary but not sufficient.

""What got you here won't get you there.""

Storytelling skills are incredibly important everywhere, but especially in tech as you move to higher levels. The job will increasingly be about convincing others of your ideas on a larger and larger scale. Storytelling does just that.

"If you want to get promoted to Senior or Principal Engineer you have to stop focusing on only your own output.

One of the most consistent patterns I see in successful candidates is their ability to grow and lead others. This can be just as important as technical excellence. 

Leaders are responsible for creating high-performing teams, but they don’t always have the time to directly mentor every junior engineer. When you step into that gap, you trigger the Mentorship Flywheel:

Grow others: Be a teacher who willingly shares knowledge and helps junior people.
↓
Build influence to set direction: As you help others, you earn the right to set the standards for how things get done.
↓
Seen as a leader: Your manager notices that you are the ""go-to"" person lifting the whole organization, which leads to your promotion.

When I discuss this flywheel I like to talk about a real-world example from my time at Amazon. To help a Senior Engineer get promoted to Principal, I had him run the design reviews for my entire organization. He set the standards for documentation, shared designs, and trained every team we met with. This clear ability to lift the entire group led to an immediate approval of his promotion.

Don’t wait for your manager to give you a big project or a mentorship assignment. Suggest a plan to them yourself. Ownership means creating your own promotion case rather than waiting with ""blind hope"".

For more knowledge about developing your career and breaking through to your next promotion, I run a course on Maven all about breaking through to strategic executive. You’ll learn how to:

--Be an influential communicator and leader on a company-level
--Be seen as a leader who enhances the whole company
--Overcome blocks to promotion

"I know an engineer who has been stuck in a mid-level role for 30+ years because he doesn’t care what his managers think. He cares about technical excellence. That is great, but it won’t get you promoted. 

Technical excellence alone does not get engineers promoted because technical excellence alone does not create business value.  To get promoted, especially at higher levels, an engineer needs to make it clear that they have an impact in at least one of these three things: 

1) Revenue Generation

This could mean they launch new features/products, facilitate payments, build systems to handle more customers, or a number of other things. However, the connection between the engineer’s work and the revenue or opportunity for revenue should be clear. 

2) Cost Reduction

On the other side of revenue is cost reduction. A business’s profits increase when its costs decrease, so doing any work that improves the efficiency of the business will be seen as valuable. 

3) Moat Construction

If an engineer’s work doesn’t have direct impact on profit but does help create a competitive advantage for the company, this will also be seen as incredibly valuable. 

The ways in which an engineer can influence each of these three things is practically unlimited, but the important thing for engineers to understand is that doing value-adding work will lead to promotion. Doing maintenance work (exclusively) leads to a maintenance position. 

This may be a very stable job, which is great if that is what you want. But it won’t be a fast-growing or far-reaching career. If you want one of those, you have to create growth for the company. 

I wrote an article for Jordan Cutler’s “High Growth Engineer” newsletter that goes through how you can become an engineer that drives impact and gets promoted to higher and higher roles. 

The insights come from my 25+ years as an engineering leader throughout my career, based directly on what has led me to promote scores of engineers. 

It includes the list of the 5 top traits in engineers that I promoted, as well as stories and examples of engineers creating outsized value.

"I almost can’t believe it: My newsletter The Operator’s Handbook crossed 10,000 subscribers!

I started this newsletter a year ago as a way to reflect on my experiences and observations at various high-growth companies, and to feel productive while I figure out what’s next. I honestly had no idea at the time whether it would turn into something “real”; I was just writing about concepts I found interesting.

Now, a year later, it has grown into a community of over 10k operators, and the reception has been mind-blowing. I’m still amazed that I can write 5,000+ word deep dives without clickbaity titles that get read by thousands, given where the content ecosystem as a whole is heading.

A huge, heartfelt 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂 to everyone who’s been reading, commenting, sharing, or just following along. Your feedback and support means everything 🙏.

And a massive thank you to a few fellow newsletter writers:

• Jordan Cutler, Benjamin Rogojan, Kyle Poyar, Ben Lang and Rameel Sheikh for the opportunity to write guest posts. Jordan is the real MVP as he reached out to me when I was still finding my style and barely had any traction, and the collab got me a massive boost in reach and motivation

• Hilary Gridley for referring a crazy amount of subscribers through recommendations; as well as Anastasiya Kuznetsova, Tessa Xie, Giacomo Falcone, Mandy Liu (Lead Data Scientist, Ex-Meta), Andres Vourakis, Polina Russell (Moskovaya) and everyone else recommending the newsletter

• And Lenny Rachitsky, the OG, for being the main inspiration for kicking off this project in the first place

"(R)evolution is here, we like it or not.


During the last Infoshare 2025 Conference Jordan Cutler showed this slide: The engineering team structure we've known for years is changing, as we speak. Because AI and other tools / tech is more and more equipped in doing things for us, the skillset vs engineering role is shifting. 

👉 Junior is becoming a Mid
👉 Mid is becoming a Senior
👉 Senior transforming into Staff Engineer (with a part of completely different skills)

I wanted to come back to it because we had a great conversation with Ari Block during our Leman Tech Leadership Podcast recording session. We've discussed how there are big predictions about engineering teams in overall. Interesting and necessary trend to follow, and build risk management around it. So we take care of our teams and businesses as well.

"🚫 Stop building agents. Here's what you should build instead.

Using agents in production code relinquishes all control to the LLM. While LLMs are smart, they're not THAT smart and will get many things wrong, like...
• What tools should be used
• When work should get handed off to the next agent
• What the output should look like

Agents are also highly non-deterministic. So the results of a documentation generation agent can make all your docs look inconsistent.

✅ Here are the five AI patterns you should know that aren't agents.
1. Prompt chaining: Call an LLM with a function. Get structured data. Feed that into the next LLM
2. Parallelization: Break up LLM calls across multiple, parallelizable functions. It speeds up the final result and results in higher quality since the LLM can just focus on one thing for each prompt
3. Routing: LLM classifies the input to a predefined set of values, then you call regular code based on what it returned
4. Orchestrator & worker: LLM takes input and generates a dynamic set of substeps from the options available. Those substeps are passed off to workers for processing
5. Evaluation & optimization: LLM takes a result and acts as an evaluator. If it doesn't meet the criteria provided, it loops back and iterates on it, like a newspaper editor.

These patterns and code snippets are all documented in the latest High Growth Engineer article if you'd like to learn more: https://lnkd.in/eRXw6dar. Shout-out to Hugo Bowne-Anderson , the guest author for this article.

"One of my early career mistakes was believing that 'expertise' is difficult or impossible to attain.

A Staff Engineer at Pinterest exposed my mistake: within 2 weeks, he knew more about the codebase than me, even though I had been working in that area for a year.

Not only did he ramp up dramatically faster, he was able to understand the abstractions far better than me. 

After a few more weeks, he understood several abstractions and libraries more deeply than anyone in the entire company.

Expertise is not something you magically get when you become senior enough. It's a prerequisite for seniority, and you can start building expertise today.

You can become more knowledgeable than anyone as long as you narrow the scope appropriately. e.g. ""In one afternoon, I can understand more about the flags to configure git log compared to anyone on my team of 10 people.""

"Today I'm launching my new book 🎉

How do you grow beyond senior as a designer?

I've taken over 6 months to answer this question in the most actionable way in my new book.

Most senior designers do not want to become managers. So I focused on the IC-roles (whether it's called Staff, Lead, or Principal at your organization).

I researched how 50+ companies evaluate designers and employees, including Etsy, Medium, Dropbox, Square, Figma, Zendesk, and Intercom.

I also interviewed 19 product designers on their progression at Figma, Instacart, Dropbox, Etsy, Twitter, and smaller companies.

The book includes actionable techniques that helped other designers get promoted beyond senior: understanding business, finding project opportunities, setting standards, selling ideas, mentoring, increasing visibility, and more.

"The Client Foundations org had the pleasure of hosting Chaitali Narla, former Google Director, for a talk on sponsorship in career growth.

A few key takeaways that resonated with the team:
1. Sponsorship differs from mentorship and coaching. It's about actively advocating for someone when they're not in the room.
2. It takes social capital, and your social capital changes across multiple dimensions - skill, domain, and people for example.
3. The part people often struggle with the most is making the ask. Many times leaders will advocate for you but need you to tell them how they can help.

I also appreciated that Chaitali gave a 3-step framework for people to find sponsorship (maybe she can share in the comments 😃).

"🔮 How much time should you invest in estimating a project?


It depends on the level of confidence you want to achieve.

- In some specific cases, it's critical to have a very clear picture before starting.
- While in the majority of cases, you can adjust your estimates on the go.

📊 Should you always estimate projects?

- Yes, in 85% of cases.
- Avoid estimating R&D projects.

💡 How can you practically estimate a new feature or a new project?

I can't tell you everything here, but you're in luck! 

Jordan Cutler did a deep dive on this in my latest newsletter article that just went out.

"There's one aspect of engineering that, in my experience, is more challenging than anything else.


🔮 Estimates.

Estimating a project often leads to friction and frustration among teams.

Why?

🤝 Lack of collaboration: teams frequently work in silos rather than uniting to achieve a common objective.

🧠 Lack of knowledge: there is often no mutual understanding of each other’s fields.

🌐 Multiple teams involved: more teams involved = more complexity

🎯 Estimations are essentially guesses: even when some factors are known, they are still largely speculative.

However, while the practice of estimating projects depends on company and team culture, in some cases, estimates are crucial, especially when:

🎯 The product team needs to decide on priorities
👥 Multiple parties are involved
⏳ The project is time-sensitive

If you want to learn more about how to estimate projects effectively, I'll be sharing an article on the subject with my ~17K subscribers tomorrow.

But there's more.

To provide you with a well-rounded perspective, I’ve teamed up with my friend Jordan Cutler who will share his extensive experience as a Senior Software Developer and teacher at Maven. 

Specifically, he will guide you through a practical and actionable use case of how he approaches project estimation!

"This is what I would do if I would be looking for a new engineering/engineering leadership role.

1. First, I would make sure that my CV is on point
It's the first impression that a hiring manager gets of you, and you must leave a good one.

2. Ensure that my LinkedIn profile is updated and optimized
Personally, LinkedIn has been huge for my career, as almost all the roles I've gotten have come through it. Either people contacted me directly, referred me, or I applied to a specific role.

3. Find 3-5 roles that fit with what I would be looking for
The reason for this is that the strategy called “spray and pray”, where you just send infinite CVs to infinite companies, normally doesn’t work so well, as companies receive a LOT of submissions.

4. Find the hiring manager or recruiter responsible for the role on LinkedIn
I would contact that person through LinkedIn and ask them a few questions about the role. Something that would be interesting for me to know and that would give me a better overview of what I can expect.

5. I would try to stand out in this step already
I would record a video, it would be a Loom video or something else, where I would share improvements (suggestions) to the product or service related to the company I am applying to. I would submit my CV and send the hiring manager the video.

Even though this takes more time, especially if you are doing this for 3-5 companies, it’s a LOT better approach than just sending CVs and hoping for the best.

Doing this will make it impossible for a hiring manager to ignore you.

"One of the biggest regrets in my career was not being aware of engineering career levels early enough.

Learn from my mistake, I don't want the same to happen to you.

Understanding what is expected of each engineering level would have helped me make better decisions earlier in my career.

I put together this mega engineering levels cheatsheet from junior levels up to staff level. 

If you are an engineer, go through it and see if you are due for a promotion, or identify gaps and work towards the next level.

If you are a student, get a sense of what is expected of you as you progress in your career.

Note: These are general guidelines for the standard tech company, using Meta and Google as reference. There can and will be deviations/exceptions depending on company culture and priorities (e.g. some high level engineers still write a lot of code).

"Now is the time to upskill. Stop thinking about how AI will eliminate your role and start thinking about how it will elevate it. Jordan Cutler’s advice? Diversify your skillset:

“Develop your people and AI skills, use AI to solve problems and ensure you have the people skills to work with *anyone*”.

He advises entry-level engineers to follow the 3 E’s framework:

- Education: Evolve your understanding of the foundations, for example, embeddings and AI's probabilistic nature and randomness. There are AI courses on Udemy that can help.

- Exposure: Curate your “information diet” and read content from credible experts (e.g., Ruben Hassid), whether in newsletters or following them on LinkedIn.

- Experience: Start building products. AI can guide you to an output, and you’ll quickly understand whether your code has worked.

For more tenured engineers, he recommends using AI to improve communication and design better systems:
- Use tools like v0 to get to a higher fidelity prototype with minimal effort
- Use tools like WriteEdge and @chatPRD to discuss/debate ideas

In summary: use AI to reduce the “time to value” for a product

"Business school teaches you about Porter's 5 Forces, SWOT etc., but you don't need that on the job. Here are frameworks you'll actually use:

Throughout December, I'll share 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗿 𝗴𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗱𝗮𝘆 that will help you grow your career.

𝙏𝙤𝙙𝙖𝙮: Frameworks that are actually useful.

1️⃣ 𝗠𝗘𝗖𝗘

MECE is the GOAT 🐐 of frameworks. It's less of a standalone framework in itself, but rather a principle that will help you make other frameworks more impactful.

It stands for 𝗠utually 𝗘xclusive and 𝗖ollectively 𝗘xhaustive. This means when you're breaking down a problem, the segments you choose don't overlap and also cover every possibility.

For example, breaking users into groups like ""new users"" and ""daily active users"" is not helpful for most analyses because a user can be both (new and active daily).

For a deep dive on MECE and how to apply it in interviews, problem solving and on-the-job communication, check out my recent guest post on Jordan Cutler's newsletter: https://lnkd.in/emRSMFM6

2️⃣ 𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗲𝘀

Issue trees help you bring structure into complicated problems or investigations.

Instead of listing out random options, you are creating a structured hierarchy in the shape of a tree (see image).

• 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: ARR is down? Could be fewer deals, lower win rates, or smaller deal sizes
• 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: Win rates are lower? Could be driven by a conversion drop at any stage of the funnel

etc.

This ensures you can rule out options one-by-one and eventually find the issue or solution. And of course, this works best if your issue tree is 𝗠𝗘𝗖𝗘 😉

𝙒𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙣 𝙝𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙙𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙞𝙣 𝙥𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙚? Here's the best guide I've read on the topic recently (by Tessa Xie): https://lnkd.in/epKauXXz

3️⃣ 𝟮𝘅𝟮 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗶𝘅

It's easy to make fun of 2x2 matrices as a simple consultant tool to impress gullible CEOs. But the simplicity is what makes them so useful.

Anyone can make a problem more complicated, but that doesn't help solve it. Our job is to 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝘆 complex issues.

So next time you're faced with a difficult trade-off or decision, try to boil it down to the two dimensions that really matter and put your options into the four boxes. Chances are, it will be much easier to align on the path forward with others.",48.0,8.0,1,,,Contrarian,Leadership/Management,Contrarian/Challenge,Statement → Commentary,Text-only,"Business school teaches you about Porter's 5 Forces, SWOT etc., but you don't need that on the job.

"The Operator's Advent Calendar Day 4: How to communicate effectively in job interviews, with coworkers and when presenting to executives 👇

Communication might seem like one of those ""everyday"" things that you don't need to learn. In reality, though, it's one of the most important skills to master if you want to be effective, regardless of whether you're an Engineer, a Data Scientist or in BizOps.

"Imagine you are checking some dashboards and notice new signups dropped by 50%. What do you do?

Most people will start with:
❌ “I think I know what’s happening. The signup page might be down again; didn’t that happen last quarter? Or it could be related to that iOS update we shipped. But it’s also December, and it could just be a weak time for signups. Maybe it will go away on its own…”

What’s the problem with this? 

𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗵𝘆𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗵𝗮𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲. 

If you get lucky, you find the problem; but if you’re not lucky, you might spend the entire day chasing down dead ends.

And if you don’t finish the investigation quickly, you’ll likely 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗶𝗿𝗰𝗹𝗲𝘀 since you lose track of what you already looked into.

🎯 The solution: Break the problem into an issue tree that follows the MECE principle.

------------------------------------

Yeah, I also have framework fatigue. Too many acronyms to remember, and most of them are useless in the day-to-day. 

Last week, Jordan's and Torsten's article made me reconsider. 

I promise you, it's quite genius:
https://lnkd.in/dRgTyAJp

𝘐𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵, 𝘐'𝘮 𝘥𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭𝘺 𝘲𝘶𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 1 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘰𝘧 5 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦. 𝘈𝘭𝘭 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘑𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘢𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘛𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯!

------------------------------------

𝗠𝗘𝗖𝗘 = 𝗠utually 𝗘xclusive and 𝗖ollectively 𝗘xhaustive.

You break down the problem into non-overlapping segments, that cover 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. 

You start by dividing the possible root causes into high-level groups. Then, you break these groups down further, ensuring every possibility is captured and none of the buckets overlap.

✅ After: “There are 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 for what could be happening: Either something is broken, or the data only makes it look like there’s a problem. If something’s broken, it could be isolated to a specific OS, or affect all devices. And the issue could be at any of the three steps of the signup process, so we’ll check them one by one.”

Don’t rely on luck to find the root cause. The MECE framework gives you a structure that ensures you will find it, and makes it easy to:

1. get everyone on the same page on what’s being investigated.
2. divide the work between different people or teams.

Another benefit of using this structure is that since you have an overview of all possible things you need to check, you can prioritize what to investigate first.

For example, you can see that checking for a data issue or seasonality first can potentially save you a lengthy investigation.

------------------------------------

In the article, Jordan and Torsten also covered:
1. Acing interviews 
2. Giving investigation updates
3. Explaining something to your colleagues

"I've interviewed hundreds of people as a hiring manager at Uber, Meta and Rippling. The candidates who crushed it all had one thing in common:

𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝗠𝗘𝗖𝗘 𝘄𝗮𝘆.

In case you're not familiar with the concept: MECE stands for 𝗠utually 𝗘xclusive and 𝗖ollectively 𝗘xhaustive. This means when you're breaking down a problem, the segments you choose don't overlap and cover every possibility.

𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄? When I asked candidates to solve a problem, many immediately jumped deep into the details.

The strongest candidates, on the other hand, first gave a structured overview of the problem and the different ways it could be solved. It usually sounded somewhat like this:

✅ “There are generally 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 we can grow ads monetization: We can 𝗲𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝟭) grow engagement, 𝟮) show more ads, or 𝟯) increase CPMs. Based on the information you provided, CPMs seem harder to move, so I'll focus on  #1 and #2. Starting with engagement, we have 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: [...]”

🤔 As the interviewer, I have no way of knowing what the candidate is thinking. But if they show their reasoning like this, I can easily follow along.

𝗜 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺, 𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗼𝗳𝗳𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵.

"Jedi trick to get past ""no"" and beat friction: Keep asking ""why"" to expand the pool of options.

Let's say you need to add a new field to another team's API endpoint. You go to their channel and ask if it's ok with them. 

They say, ""We already have so many fields on this endpoint and don't want to add anymore.""

🫠 with that response, they don't give you much to work with.

But, asking ""WHY?"" reveals new opportunities.
• You: ""Why is having more a problem?"" 
• Them: ""We want to be wary of performance.""

Ahh, no new fields was the surface reason. Performance is the root reason.

• You: ""Would it be ok then if I ran benchmarks on the new field to make sure they're within your threshold?""
• Them: ""Sure! We'd be ok with trying that.""

Like magic, you went from no -> yes by asking ""why.""

As a Jedi would say, ""These are not the real reasons you are blocking me for"" 😉 

--
In the newest High Growth Engineer article, I expand on this example even further, showing you what to do if the performance benchmarks come out poorly and still get past ""no."" 

Plus, I share 4 other tricks like this with examples.

"Contributing to or organizing an engineering guild is a great way to grow in your career!

A great example of doing this the right way is Jordan Cutler.

This is what he did:
- He started to share tips and overall knowledge and awareness on Frontend topics by creating a Slack channel.
- He shared daily tips which led to more and more people joining it every day.
- New people started to also share knowledge and tips there.
- This has then become a place for people to share and exchange knowledge on Frontend topics.

Jordan has similarly contributed to other guilds for example GraphQL guild and this has been one of the key things that played a part in his promotion to the Senior SWE position.

"Like many scaling CS teams, we were working across six tools to support customers at DataGrail. Pylon's Account Intelligence streamlined that for us.

As our strategy evolved from managing renewals to driving product adoption, we needed a complete view of customer health. But key context was spread across across Slack, Salesforce, Google Drive, and more.

Since our support team was already using Pylon, we decided to consolidate and implement Account Intelligence.

The results: → All customer data unified in one place → Hours saved per week on manual account research → At-risk accounts identified automatically through health scoring → Found customers paying for products they haven't deployed (contraction risk) → Spotted customers using products beyond their contracts (expansion opportunities)

The consolidation of support and success operations has been incredibly beneficial for our team.

I’ve been lucky to watch his journey from when we both left Airbnb. Before Pylon were 3 other failed ideas. 

What looks like an “overnight success” was actually the fourth attempt

… and the result of taking big swings, failing fast, and getting back up even faster.

I sat down with Marty to talk about:
→ Why he sleeps ~6 hours and works 6 days a week — and how he stays energized doing it
→ How Pylon went from “living in the office” to a 55-person Series B rocket ship
→ Co-founder matching, painful pivots & the early years that almost broke him
→ What really motivates someone to start a company (and why most people get this wrong)
→ Why he thinks “passion” is overrated for founders

"NEW: Case Study for Pylon is finally live✨

Earlier this year, Slope partnered with Pylon to create a new brand identity system and website. They wanted to up-level their brand to be more refined, enterprise-ready, something that could scale with them longer-term.
--

Pylon brings structure to modern B2B operations, giving companies the systems and support they need to run with stability and scale. Their platform turns scattered workflows into connected formations, strong enough for enterprise, flexible enough for fast-moving teams. 

Slope partnered with Pylon to create a brand identity and website that reflect this foundation: engineered, reliable, and built around supporting customers at every level.

The visual system is rooted in architectural logic—grids, beams, and structural units that act as a metaphor for how Pylon supports its customers. Every line carries weight, every shape reinforces another, and every formation suggests a network designed to hold things together. It’s a clean, geometric language that feels precise, intentional, and dependable. 

The result is a brand built like a support structure itself: steady, organized, and always working behind the scenes to keep things standing.

Thanks Marty Kausas Robert Eng and the Pylon team for the great partnership, and Andrew Johnson for leading this project on the Slope side :)

"We were drowning in customer Slack channels. Then we thought of Pylon.

At Hyperspell (YC F25)), we’ve always tried to stay as close to our users as humanly possible. We’re on call 24/7, helping with launches at 3 am, joining Slack huddles, and showing up in person to onboard teams. Most customers have our numbers. Many have group chats.

I started Hyperspell from Mission Control, the same house where Marty and his cofounders created Pylon after solving messy customer support across a million Slack channels for Hightouch, another MC company. I’d heard that story a hundred times living there. 

Now, months later, we were feeling that same pain. Over 50 shared Slack channels, constant customer asks, and messages coming in from every direction. We even spun up a Microsoft Teams channel for one customer, and that pushed us over the edge.

I knew just who to call. 

Within 15 minutes of the demo, we signed. Pylon pulls every customer conversation into one place, learns from past replies, connects to our docs, and supports Slack, email, Teams, and soon WhatsApp. In other words, exactly what we needed. 

A full circle moment. A product born at Mission Control now helping us serve our customers better as we scale.

"Today I'm excited to start a new series...

🦄 How Pylon Uses Pylon 🦄

Part 1: How We Escalate Bugs to Engineering

When customers report bugs, support needs to loop in engineering.

But our support team lives in Pylon while engineers work in Slack.

So we solve this by creating ""internal threads"" within Pylon issues that automatically post to a Slack channel...

→ #𝗯𝘂𝗴𝘀-𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆 when it's high-priority and should be resolved within the day
→ #𝗯𝘂𝗴𝘀-𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗽𝗿𝗶 if it's non-urgent
→ #𝗯𝘂𝗴𝘀-𝗮𝗶 when we specifically need the AI team to investigate

This quickly notifies the right engineers, tells them the priority level, and gives them a link to full issue context.

Engineers then reply directly from Slack and their messages sync to the Pylon internal thread. 

Everyone gets to work from their preferred platform without missing cross-functional communications.

You can now gather information about accounts from live web sources like a company website or news articles.

Customer details like recent funding rounds can signal expansion opportunities or a change in product needs. But until now there was no way to automatically bring that context into your account management workflows.

Here's how it works...

1/ Create an AI web research custom field
2/ Prompt AI on how to collect the information you need
3/ Specify the type of data to retrieve (number, text, etc.)
4/ Save and let AI do the research

We also provide a few templates so you can start pulling company details, acquisition status, or latest funding right away. 

Some of our favorite use cases so far...

→ Flag a potential upsell if a customer closed funding in the last 3 months
→ Check in with your champion if their company was recently acquired 
→ Extract data on current employee count to identify expansion opportunities

"We’re thrilled to co-lead Pylon’s Series B alongside our friends at Bain Capital. Backing Marty Kausas, Advith Chelikani, Robert Eng, and the Pylon team a second time is an easy decision - their ambition and execution continue to shine, and the amount of grit and hustle they bring is the engine behind Pylon’s incredible momentum.

When we first invested, they had a bold vision: reinvent B2B customer support from the ground up. Not just a better ticketing tool, but the Zendesk killer - a platform built for the way modern teams actually work.

Fast forward a couple of years:
- Hundreds of companies have switched from legacy tools like Zendesk and Intercom to Pylon.
- They now power support for fast-growing leaders such as ElevenLabs, Deel., Hightouch, and Fireworks AI.

And they’ve expanded the vision into something far bigger: a single platform where the entire post-sales experience comes together.

What makes this team stand out isn’t just vision, but discipline and speed They constantly debate priorities, cut distractions, and relentlessly optimize for decision-making. In a competitive SaaS market, where there are no easy shortcuts, the formula is simple: speed × hustle × customer obsession.
Pylon’s growth is proof: build a product customers can’t live without, and growth will follow.

Note: 

1. B2B support is fundamentally different from B2C support, where every ticket adds on to COGS. A big portion of B2B success is onboarding, retention and expansion - it’s not a cost center but a revenue generator. 
2. B2B support is also a function that touches several organizations on both sides from sales, to product, to engineering. That’s why you need a first-class support tool to serve a complex team matrix.
3. Pylon lets you engage with customers in their native channels such as Slack, Teams or email. Having timely conversations enriched with context is a huge differentiator for companies today. People are not just buying software, they are also buying the experience with a vendor. 
4. AI support agents are all the rage today. A system of record is still needed, I dare to say, more crucial. Because it stores the most important customer data and touchpoints.

after we ran the first panel series in NYC/SF around GTM + AI broadly, one topic that a lot of people asked us to go deeper on was ""how do I choose my next sales role in AI?""

most GTM-ers I know have been burned a time or two and want to make sure they're not making preventable mistakes - I know I've had my share of swings and misses personally

was amazing to see ~100 top early-career talent show up to one of VibeScaling's star portcos in Pylon, coming off a big series B raise from a16z and a recent Enterprise Tech 30 land

thank you to our world-class speakers:
- Chelsea Palmer (formerly early GTM @ Stripe, currently @ Anthropic, and our biggest GTMBA fan 😎)
- Mana Anvar (recently promoted to head of sales @ Pylon)
- Nicole Wemple (Segment alum, currently @ Hex)
- Cailen DSa (founding GTM @ 6 unicorns, currently CEO @ VibeScaling) 

and a huge shoutout to Marty Kausas for being a great partner and hosting us

we plan to throw these private events monthly in SF and NYC, excited for the next one next month with Emergence Capital with George Kunthara in SF, with a few others to be announced in the fall shortly

"The future of B2B support isn’t just faster — it’s smarter.

In 2022, three engineers noticed something: B2B support teams were ditching email for Slack and Teams, but their tools hadn’t caught up. Then ChatGPT dropped, and the game changed again.

So Marty Kausas, Robert Eng and Advith Chelikani built Pylon — a platform purpose-built for this new world of real-time, AI-first support.

What started as a simple Slack connector is now replacing legacy support systems at companies like Temporal, Honeycomb and Lumos. And Pylon’s conversational AI is powering more than just ticketing — it’s helping teams identify upsell opportunities, manage account health, and unify post-sales operations.

This is what it looks like when timing, technical insight and relentless execution converge.

"Every Y Combinator founder I asked about content-led sales pointed me to the same person: Marty Kausas, CEO of Pylon. 

I’ve been trying to level up my own founder-led sales and content. So I went back and studied all of Marty’s posts from the past month. The patterns are incredibly consistent—and useful if you’re a founder trying to scale your content as a growth channel.

---  

Here are 5 things he does best 👇  

1. Company milestones as category narrative  
- Examples: Series B (2,627 likes), new brand (181), “What changed since B” (126).  
- Pattern: numbers + category claim (“first B2B support platform”) + hiring CTA.  
- Lesson: Milestones hit harder when they reinforce your category story.  

2. Culture as performance marketing  
- Examples: Hawaii offsite (522), Sundays in office (235), 92-hour founder weeks (320), office expansion (278).  
- Pattern: vivid scenes + high standards + visible rewards → recruiting CTA.  
- Lesson: Culture posts attract high-agency talent and signal momentum to customers and investors.  

3. Product drops with clear outcomes  
- Examples: Account Intelligence launch (512), MS Teams chat (181), monthly ship list (135).  
- Pattern: “X → Y → Z” framing, feature lists, non-technical claims, shoutouts.  
- Lesson: Don’t just announce features—tie them to outcomes like speed, retention, or revenue.  

4. External validation & borrowed credibility  
- Examples: The Information article (257), BCV/TBPN reposts (234 & 74), customer video review (18).  
- Pattern: third-party quotes + hard metrics (NRR 158%, GRR 94%).  
- Lesson: Borrow trust from others—press, investors, and customers sell your story better than you can.  

5. Contrarian/operator takes  
- Examples: “Founders shouldn’t take vacations” (316), “In-person beats remote” (225), pricing evolution (106).  
- Pattern: strong POV + one chart/story + tidy takeaway.  
- Lesson: Hot takes grounded in operating experience spark conversation and expand reach.  

---  

Notes on format & craft:  
- Hooks: 1–2 punchy lines, then a blank line, then bullets.  
- Numbers everywhere: cash, headcount, % growth, NRR/GRR.  
- Repeatable blocks: “— Notes —”, “What/How/Why”, “Shoutouts”.  
- CTAs: almost always “we’re hiring” or “demo.”  
- Multimedia: photos, screenshots, launch clips → *proof of momentum.*  
- Cadence: 3–6 substantive posts/week around launches, hiring waves, fundraises.  

---

"IN NEWS: Pylon raises $31M Series B (co-led by Andreessen Horowitz & Bain Capital Ventures.)

Pylon is going after the B2B slice of support, not the simpler, transactional B2C queues. 

“In consumer you have very simple transactional support... In B2B you don’t just have customer support, you also have customer success, solutions, professional services, account management.” –Marty Kausas (Co-Founder & CEO)

Tickets need rich account context (CRM notes, call recordings, implementation plans), and routing spans multiple post-sales teams.

“One way to think about us strategically is we’re building something similar to Rippling, but for the post-sales use case.”

"Pylon is reinventing B2B customer support for the modern era. As businesses shift from email to real-time collaboration channels like Slack and Teams, legacy tools have struggled to keep pace. 

Pylon was purpose-built for this shift, enabling companies to manage conversations natively in these channels while layering in AI-powered features like account intelligence, ticket automation and knowledge management. The result is faster support, stronger customer relationships and a platform that scales across the entire post-sales organization.

What impressed us most about co-founders Marty Kausas, Robert Eng and Advith Chelikani is their clarity of vision and relentless execution. In just over two years, they’ve grown to more than 750 customers, including Temporal, AssemblyAI and Together AI, while displacing entrenched incumbents at scale.

"I'm excited to share that I've been promoted to Head of Sales at Pylon.

I initially joined Pylon for three reasons:

1/ a product that I genuinely believed in,
2/ founders that I’d walk into battle for, and
3/ a culture that valued grit and drive.

I framed this message from a prospect (now customer) above my kitchen sink — a daily reminder of the standard of excellence that I held myself to during every call. It is the same standard that I hold the sales team to today.

Deeply grateful to Marty for the opportunity, Andy for the continued guidance, and the entire team for the camaraderie. I wouldn’t want to do this with anyone else.

"You’ll probably get fired for buying IBM.

My friend Marty Kausas’s company, Pylon, is eating Zendesk’s lunch. They’re a scrappy startup, just two years old, and they’re winning every deal against Zendesk. When I caught up with Marty at SaaStr today, he joked, “The only rebuttal Zendesk has is that Pylon is a Series A company”—ironically, that’s just one of many reasons they’re crushing Zendesk. 

Enterprises are increasingly turning to best-in-breed startups to educate them about the future of their business.

Across my portfolio I’m seeing enterprises looking to seed-stage companies to inform their AI strategies. Amanda Kahlow, CEO of 1Mind, texts me at least once a week to share news of another enterprise deal she’s landed. Ana-Maria Constantin CEO of Cascade is securing six-figure contracts with some of the largest medical companies in the country, and Maryam Khan Meurer CEO at Axle Mobility already has enterprise customers that took us years to land at Motive!

The pattern is clear: if you’re not on the cusp of AI, you’re probably going to get fired soon for sticking to the same old big-name vendors. You need to be reinventing your business. The old saying goes—you never got fired for buying IBM, but in this innovation cycle, the opposite is true!

"A few weeks ago we flew out to New York to launch our Account Management product, turning Pylon into the first B2B Support Platform. 

B2B teams need more than just ticketing. They also need data, workflows, and views for all of their customer facing teams across account management, customer success, solutions, marketing, and more. 

We want to become your all-in-one platform for your post-sales team.

While working towards this vision, Pylon was lucky to be listed on this year's Enterprise 30 list run by Wing and Eric Newcomer.

3/ CSMs can ask for account context without having to remember every detail

"Marty Kausas co-founded Pylon, a B2B support platform that's raised $20 million in funding.

Their journey began at Airbnb, where Marty worked as a software engineer until he ""absolutely hated it"" and decided to start a company.

What followed was 18 months of failed ideas and pivots before finding product-market fit.

Their breakthrough approach? Instead of building for a problem they had: 
→ Each co-founder sent 40 personalized LinkedIn messages daily 
→ They targeted professionals with newer job titles 
→ They systematically interviewed everyone who would talk to them

A pattern emerged: B2B companies were supporting their customers through Slack but had no way to: 
→ Track conversations 
→ Create tickets 
→ Measure performance 
→ Connect data to their CRM

Their first customer came from a spontaneous conversation in their hacker house. Within 14 days, they had an MVP in use.

Initially, Pylon was just a Zendesk-Slack connector, but customer feedback pushed them toward a bigger opportunity.

The fundamental insight: B2B support is structurally different from B2C.

""In B2C companies, you only have one team that's customer-facing. In B2B, you have customer support, customer success, solutions, professional services—all these different teams need to work with customer data.""

This led to a bold positioning strategy: ""building the next Zendesk"" specifically for B2B companies.

While the entire support industry chases AI-powered ticket deflection, Pylon recognized that B2B customers need something different — workflow optimization for complex technical problems that can't be easily automated away.

Their growth engine? Founder-led marketing on LinkedIn generates half their pipeline: 
→ All three co-founders post daily 
→ Marty spends 5+ hours every Sunday batch-writing posts 
→ Their strategy combines build-in-public transparency with targeted ""villain brand"" positioning

Pylon's most effective content frames product updates as narratives, not features: ""Our analytics, our worst feature. That changes today.""

For founders struggling with marketing, Marty offers blunt advice: ""If you are a founder who's not comfortable with that, it sucks. Get over it or find a co-founder who is willing to do it.""

Marty's team is now systematically building toward their audacious goal: a $10 billion market cap in seven years.

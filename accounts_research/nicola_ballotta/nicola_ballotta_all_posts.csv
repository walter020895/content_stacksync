"Many Engineering Managers often believe that quickly expanding their teams will lead to getting more things done.


❌ Wrong assumption.

In reality, scaling a team quickly often leads to more issues.

Before scaling your team, it's crucial to:

📋 Establish effective processes and document them: this will ensure smoother onboarding and alignment with the existing team dynamics.

🌟 Understand the Current Team's Capabilities: it's important to know what skills and strengths your current team has. This helps in understanding what new skills are needed in the team.

🤝 Ensure that the team is happy: hiring more people when there are team issues will increase friction.

🚀 Implement a well-structured onboarding process: when you hire new people, it's important to have a streamlined onboarding approach, or there will be a high risk of losing them immediately.

💼 Define Clear Roles and Responsibilities: before hiring, be clear about the roles and responsibilities the new team members will have. This helps avoid overlap and confusion.

❓ Verify the genuine need for additional team members: don't hire just to follow a hiring roadmap you defined at the beginning of the year.

Have I missed anything?

"Especially in the IT Engineering field, where competition is high, there's a common misconception that salary is the only factor that matters.

Of course, salary is important.

But it's rarely the main driver of retention. Otherwise, everyone would only apply for jobs at FAANG companies.

In reality, for the majority of us in this field, several other key factors make a difference.

💰 Salary: it's crucial and should align with your competencies, but it doesn't have to be the highest in the market.

📚 Learning: providing people with a learning budget to use throughout the year is highly appreciated.

📈 Personal Growth: opportunities for career advancement and skill development matter significantly.

🏛️ Culture: a positive work environment, loving what you do, and enjoying the company of your colleagues are some of the most important aspects.

🏋️‍♂️ Well-Being: mental and physical health has become a priority over the last decade. People value free time to spend with their families or for their hobbies.

Next time, before increasing your employees' salaries (which is fine), as a manager, ensure your team already has access to all of the above.

What other important retention elements have I missed?

"As an Engineering Leader, there's one thing you have to carefully watch out for within your teams.


🚫 Over-Engineering.

Engineers often aim for perfection.

On one hand, this is good because it means they care and don't want to deliver crappy solutions. On the other hand, there's always the risk that they might focus on things that are not necessary from the beginning.

This is also why you want to foster a product-oriented mindset among your engineers.

🚀 When you have to launch a new product, you don't need to think about scaling it to 10 million users from the beginning, providing a 99.999% Uptime SLA, or building it on 20 microservices.

The first thing a product needs is validation, and you want it to happen sooner rather than later.

For this reason, it's important to:

🔥 Focus on delivering an MVP. This doesn't mean delivering low quality, but focusing on making the product ready for 100 or 1000 customers, not 10M.

♻️ Invest in a robust CI/CD system. This will facilitate faster iterations on the product, enabling you to improve the product and fix bugs more rapidly.

🏗️ Keep the architecture simple. While microservices are powerful for large teams and complex architectures (although not a strict rule), they are  also challenging to manage and coordinate.

🗣️ Involve your team in product discussions. This will help them understand why certain decisions are made and why perfection isn't expected right from the beginning.

What else?

"I'm not a great reader, but there's one book I've been reading for the third year in a row that you should check out.


🚀 𝗔𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗛𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁𝘀.

One of the most important concepts in the book is the ""Plateau of Latent Potential,"" which, in simple terms, is the time that elapses between when we start doing something and when we actually see results.

We often expect this duration to be linear and assume that as soon as we start doing something, we should immediately see some small results. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way, and this mismatch can lead to disappointment, which often results in giving up.

The reality is that you usually begin to see progress just when you've passed a certain critical threshold, and then it becomes exponential.

🌀 Think about when you want to introduce a change in your team, even a small one, or when you want to learn something new. Instead of focusing on the results, be consistent in what you want to achieve, not just for days or weeks, but at least for a few months. Eventually, the results will come, and they will be exponential.

I'm impatient by nature, but this book literally changed my life and how I perceive change and progress.

𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘁:

🚧 I started many things and eventually abandoned them after a few weeks or months.

📏 I was measuring my progress every single day, without actually seeing any progress.

😞 I felt frustrated and sometimes doubted my intelligence to accomplish things.

𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘁:

🌟  I'm still impatient, but I stick with the things that really matter to me.

⏱️ I stopped measuring my progress every day; now, I look at my progress each month.

🌤️ Sometimes I still feel frustrated, but when I do, it's because I know I wasn't consistent enough in my efforts.

Did you read this book? How it impacted your life?

"There's one thing that literally changed my approach to sharing content during the last 6 months.


Learn to create visuals.

I can't count how many people reach out to me every day to ask how I create these visuals.

They are always surprised when I tell them that I can barely hold a pencil in my hand, that I had no previous design experience, and that it takes me from 10-20 minutes to create one of these.

𝗦𝗼 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗜 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁?

🧠 I took a course from Janis Ozolinis that opened my mind (link in the comments).

✍️ I began practicing and publishing visuals from day one (even if they weren't great).

👀 I started following great visual designers and interacted with them.

🔁 I experimented a lot, changed things  (I created 15 versions of my own font).

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸?

📝 I use Figma and I collect all my ideas there.

🗂️ I have one page on Figma with all my visuals divided into 3 sections: Ideas, Drafts, Published.

💡 Every time I have an inspiration or I see something that could be transformed into a visual, I draw a sketch in the ""Ideas"" section.

🚸 Every morning, while walking back from taking my daughter to kindergarten, I start thinking about a visual and a post I want to publish.

🏠 Once at home, I create the visual; a simple visual usually takes between 10-20 minutes, while I create more complex visuals during the weekends.

🤖 Once it's done, I ask ChatGPT if the visual makes sense and the wording is correct (this to me is very helpful).

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼 𝗜 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲?

🎨 Visualizing your ideas helps make them easily understandable to everyone.

👁️‍🗨️ Visuals capture attention and so they are great for delivering quick ideas on social networks.

🌐 You can use visuals everywhere: in your documents, presentations, with your kids, etc.

📊 Visuals make complex content lighter and smoother to read (for me, it was very useful in my newsletter).

If you want to start creating visuals, these are some people I'd suggest you follow:

Janis Ozolins
Roberto Ferraro
Pejman Milani
Hannah Wilson
Ash Lamb
Michael J Boorman
Lee Sampson
Liz Fosslien

I also included what I think are my 10 best visuals. Name your favorite in the comments!

"There's one aspect of engineering that, in my experience, is more challenging than anything else.


🔮 Estimates.

Estimating a project often leads to friction and frustration among teams.

Why?

🤝 Lack of collaboration: teams frequently work in silos rather than uniting to achieve a common objective.

🧠 Lack of knowledge: there is often no mutual understanding of each other’s fields.

🌐 Multiple teams involved: more teams involved = more complexity

🎯 Estimations are essentially guesses: even when some factors are known, they are still largely speculative.

However, while the practice of estimating projects depends on company and team culture, in some cases, estimates are crucial, especially when:

🎯 The product team needs to decide on priorities
👥 Multiple parties are involved
⏳ The project is time-sensitive

If you want to learn more about how to estimate projects effectively, I'll be sharing an article on the subject with my ~17K subscribers tomorrow.

But there's more.

To provide you with a well-rounded perspective, I’ve teamed up with my friend Jordan Cutler who will share his extensive experience as a Senior Software Developer and teacher at Maven. 

Specifically, he will guide you through a practical and actionable use case of how he approaches project estimation!

Don't miss out on it!

"Should You Stay Technical as an Engineering Manager? Should You Still Write Code or Be Hands-On?


I frequently receive these kinds of questions from other engineers or first-time EMs who are struggling with similar issues, and I believe the answer is a bit more complex than a simple yes or no like many tend to give.

First of all, a distinction has to be made between ""staying technical"" and ""being hands-on,"" which are often confused:

🛠️ Staying Technical: involves keeping up with technologies in your environment and understanding their workings.

🙌 Being Hands-On: involves directly engaging in technical activities like coding or system development.

While as you progress into leadership roles, we usually observe (with some exceptions) a notable decline in hands-on involvement, the need to stay technical remains constant and becomes crucial for an EM.

So, how do you stay technical?

🤝 Joining technical meetings to stay up-to-date and engaged with the team.

📝 Contributing to documentation to solidify understanding and assist the team.

🛠️ Building internal tools to maintain coding skills and create useful resources.

🎤 Presenting team projects to understand and simplify technical concepts.

These are just a few ways to stay technical.

I wrote about this and much more in my latest newsletter issue, which I'm honored to say was sponsored by CTO Craft Con London (an awesome conference about Technical Leadership).  

Inside the article you'll find a promo code, so you can get an additional 10% off your conference ticket👇

https://lnkd.in/dv3PYb3g

Since this is still a hot topic, I'd be really interested to hear feedback from other engineers and EMs.

"Over the past few years as an Engineering Director, there's been a pivotal role that has really helped my department succeed.

A Technical Program Manager.

The funny thing is that until a couple of years ago, I barely knew what a TPM is 😅 

But now, I can't imagine our workflow without one. 

So, what's a TPM?

In simple terms, a Technical Program Manager is an individual responsible for overseeing multiple complex projects, covering everything from planning and execution to delivery.

Why did we need a TPM, and why might you need one too?

 📈 Increasing project complexity
🔄 Need for better cross-functional coordination 
🔗 Aligning multidisciplinary teams 
🛠️ Freeing engineers from project management tasks

Here are the benefits we've experienced in the short to medium term after hiring a TPM:

🎯 Clearer project objectives 
🌊 Smoother processes 
🧭 Strategic project alignment with organizational goals
⚠️ Proactive risk management 
📊 Resource optimization

Hiring a Technical Program Manager isn't an easy task. 

You often need someone with a ""T-Shaped"" profile: a generalist with substantial expertise in your specific field and excellent soft skills.

But don't worry, it's Thursday, and I've got all of this and much more covered in The Hybrid Hacker, my newsletter about Engineering, Leadership, and Career Growth, which is sent to 23.3K subscribers.

"In an era where technology has become mainstream and AI is quickly growing, Soft Skills > Hard Skills.

What makes a real difference are people, and that's why it's so important to know which skills to develop.

When I seek new engineers or EMs, these are the five categories of soft skills I look for:

🧠 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ Traits and abilities that define how individuals manage themselves and react to situations, such as resilience and self-awareness.

🤝 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ Abilities enabling positive interactions and teamwork, like empathy and conflict resolution.

🗣️ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ The capacity to convey and receive information clearly, through speaking, writing, and body language.

🗂️ 𝗢𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ The ability to plan, prioritize, and manage resources and tasks efficiently.

👑 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
↳ Qualities that inspire and guide others, including decision-making, motivation, and team building.

Many believe these skills are innate, but I assure you that, like hard skills, you can learn soft skills and become a better engineer or leader.

In my newsletter today (a bit late due to a bad flu), I delved deeper into soft skills, giving practical advice on training and balancing them based on your career path.

"You often hear people telling you about the importance of Listening over Speaking, but there's something even more powerful. 


🧠 Remembering what people say.

Remembering demonstrates not just that you've heard, but that you truly value the speaker's words.

As an Engineering Leader or Manager, this can make a huge difference and offers many benefits:

🤝 More than just Listening: it shows you really care about your team.

👥 Builds Connections: it's a way to show you've genuinely listened and remembered.

🔄 Keeps Conversations Going: makes it easier to reconnect with earlier discussions.

❤️ Builds Trust: when you remember, people feel valued and understood.

🚀 Gives You an Edge: in your job, remembering details can significantly impact your effectiveness.

If you're like me and sometimes struggle to remember everything, there's a simple solution.

"I'm not a genius, nor do I have a high IQ, but one thing has been key to my success.


Observation.

As an introvert, I enjoy observing and listening to other people, and this is what has brought me to where I am today and continues to keep me learning.

This is how:

🛠️ I became an Engineer:
⮑ When I was younger, I observed many other engineers. How they approached problems, how they built resilient systems, how they coded.

👥 I became an Engineering Manager:
⮑ At one point in my career, I found myself in the EM position without any previous experience. I started following other EMs or just managers, read about their experiences, and asked them to share their learnings.

👨‍💼 I became a Director:
⮑ As with the EM role, there were no courses to learn how to play in this position. That's why I approached other people in these roles, observed the ones in my company, and learned from them.

✍️ I recently became a newsletter author:
⮑ I'm not bad at writing; in fact, I love it. But writing for a wider audience and in a language that isn't your first, that's something else. That's why before launching my newsletter, I approached other writers, listened to their experiences, and took a lot of inspiration from all of them.

Books are a good way to learn. 

Doing things yourself and learning from mistakes is a great way to learn. 

💡 Observing, listening, and imitating other people is, in my opinion, still the best and fastest way to learn something.

How do you learn?

🚧 Removing blockers.

Career growth, mentoring, 1:1s, and other duties are crucial for an Engineering Manager, but the first and most important thing your team needs is to be empowered to do their job.

Removing any blockers that could arise in their daily job is the best thing you can do to empower them.

What does it mean in practice?

🔧 Identifying and helping resolve technical issues that could affect projects.

🤝 Facilitating clear and open communication by resolving any conflicts that could arise among team members.

📚 Providing resources and opportunities for professional development to help team members expand their skills and knowledge to solve blockers.

⚖️ Balancing project efforts with team capacity, ensuring workloads are manageable, and expectations are realistic.

🔄 Using tools and ways of working that make things go smoother and quicker.

🛡️ Creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable raising their hands to report any blockers at any time.

"Yesterday, I achieved a significant milestone much sooner than I ever expected.

🚀 20,000 subscribers to my newsletter, The Hybrid Hacker.

In just about 13 months. Back in November, I was at 9k, which means I nearly doubled my subscriber count in the last three months.

These numbers are all relative. I know of people who grew much faster, and others slower. As I often say, statistics only give you a perception of growth.

What truly confirms my growth is:

📚 The amount I've learned from writing
↳ Writing not only enhanced my consistency but also significantly broadened my knowledge, including a big improvement in my English.

👥 The number of people I've connected with during this period.
↳ Despite being an introvert and often hesitant about networking, I met 100+ great people in the last year, some of whom I've developed genuine relationships with.

🙏 People who reached out to thank me for my writing.
↳ Here on LinkedIn alone, I have an endless backlog of DMs awaiting my response (I promise to reply to all, as always!). These messages range from thanks and support requests to simple greetings.

💖 And, of course, those who chose to support me with a paid subscription.
↳ Currently, I have 111 paid subscribers. While this isn't a business for me (I have my full-time job), the income helps me purchase tools, newsletter subscriptions, courses, etc., to enhance my content quality. It's also incredibly rewarding to see people willing to pay for what I create.

Considering these four ""KPIs"", I can confidently say my growth was exponential.

So, how did I achieve these numbers?

Two factors were key:

- Consistency
- People

The latter was crucial, and there's an endless list of people I need to thank. I'm sure I'll forget someone; they are simply too many:

For being a great inspiration and supporting me from the start of my journey:
- 🌀 Luca Rossi
- Jordan Cutler
- Gregor Ojstersek
- Omar Halabieh
- Irina Stanescu
- Caleb Mellas
- Anemari Fiser
- Ryan Peterman
- Raviraj Achar
- Richard Donovan
- Luca Sartoni
- Roberto Ferraro
- Janis Ozolins
- Anton Zaides

For becoming part of my network and helping me grow over the past months:
- Neo Kim
- Alex Xu
- Wes Kao
- Alex Nguyen
- Kahlil Lechelt
- Dr Milan Milanović
- Alex Ewerlöf
- Pascalle Bergmans 🧚‍♀️

For joining and consistently supporting my Slack community of creators:
- Sergio Visinoni
- Petar Ivanov
- Anco van der Wurff
- Mihai-Valentin Curelea
- Mauro B.
- Itzy Sabo
- Radu-Tudor Susanu
- Denis Čahuk
- Adrian Stanek
- Daniel Hauck

For recently joining my network and being supportive:
- Matteo Cellini
- Ryan Murphy
- Alvaro Jose Lorente Perez
- Daniel Moka
- Francisco Manuel Soto Ramírez
- Lee Sampson

A huge thanks to everyone from the bottom of my heart!

"There's one mistake I've made multiple times in my career that has led to losing great talents.


❌ Not caring for people from the beginning.

You spend an incredible amount of effort to hire someone:

- kicking off the hiring process
- assessing hundreds of profiles
- doing tons of interviews
- checking a lot of code challenges

Then, you find a talent that perfectly fits your team. You get them onboarded, and since everything seems to be going well, you forget about them.

Eventually, perhaps after a year or two, you start to notice signs of disengagement from this team member. You sense their unhappiness, until the day they ask for a meeting to announce their resignation.

And so you ask if there's something you can do to change their mind, offering a salary raise or more benefits.

But guess what? It's too late.

I've learned that the hard way. 

As soon as you onboard a new team member, that's when you have to start caring about them and ensuring:

🤝 Regular check-ins (1:1s): focus on how they're feeling, not just updates on what they've accomplished.

💰 Proactive salary reviews: if your team members are performing well, they deserve recognition through raises. And while the budget isn't always under your control, it's your duty to advocate for them.

🌱 Comprehensive support: offer mentorship and development opportunities to help them grow. Make them feel valued not just for their work but for their potential.

⚖️ Work-life balance: encourage a healthy balance. Overworking can lead to burnout, which no raise can compensate for.

"At the beginning of my career as an Engineering Leader, there was one thing that I struggled with. 


😖 My impatience.

As an individual contributor, you receive a task, complete it, and feel rewarded.

However, as an Engineering Leader, immediate results are rare.

You must work diligently to achieve larger projects, guide your team toward your vision, and influence others.

⏳ This process takes time. Depending on the goal, it could take weeks, months, or even years.

For this reason, it's quite easy to focus on daily failures instead of concentrating on the bigger picture, which is often better than what you believed.

It's a mental exercise that takes time to get used to.

Here's what helped me:

📝 Journaling: being able to reflect on past experiences helps maintain perspective on the bigger picture.

♻️ Establishing routines: sometimes, the Engineering Leader role feels intangible in terms of daily work. Establishing routines contributes to making progress more visible.

📚 Viewing failures as learning opportunities: don't be discouraged by failures, as they provide valuable lessons for both you and your team.

🌟 Celebrating successes: acknowledge and celebrate achievements, both big and small, within your team. This helps reinforce the idea of progress.

What strategies do you use to overcome impatience?

🏖️ It was nothing too fancy. I simply chose to take a two-week break, completely disconnected from everything.

I admit, I was a bit afraid about stepping away from LinkedIn, my newsletter, my job, and everything else. The fear of losing touch with my audience was real, but I had to weigh that against burnout, something I'm all too familiar with.

 So, I took the 'risk' and disconnected for two weeks.

Guess what?

🎉 Nothing bad happened and the best part is that I came back much more relaxed, with tons of fresh ideas for 2024.

Sometimes we're so engaged in what we love doing, that it becomes challenging to step back and take a break. But here's a reminder: it's better to 'lose' two weeks to rest than to face burnout and potentially lose months, or even a year.

💡 To help manage my work-life balance, I've developed a personal framework that I call the '3-3-3 Anti-Burnout Rule'. 

This means dedicating: 

- at least 3 hours each week
- 3 days each month,
- 3 weeks each year 

to completely disconnect, rest, reflect, and self-assess. While I strive for more, I never go below these thresholds.

🚀 This not only keeps me away from burnout, but it also helps sharpen and skyrocket my productivity.

And you? Are you taking any regular fully disconnected time?

"There's one thing that could easily disrupt your team without you even noticing.


Accepting bad behavior.

Being tolerant with your people, accepting them making mistakes is perfectly fine; but there are several unwritten rules and behaviors that should generally never be accepted because they can undermine teamwork, trust, and productivity.

Some of them include:

🚫 Disrespect: any form of disrespect towards team members.
🙅‍♂️ Bullying or Harassment: making fun of or bothering others.
🧨 Undermining Others: deliberately sabotaging or undermining a colleague's work.
❌ Ignoring Decisions: once a decision is made by the team, ignoring or actively working against it.
🙈 Not Acknowledging Mistakes: failing to take responsibility for errors.
🏆 Taking Credit for Others' Work: claiming others' achievements as one's own.
💸 Misusing Resources: using team resources for personal gain.
🤐 Breaking Confidentiality: sharing sensitive information without authorization.

  
In the past, it happened to me to accept some of these behaviors. I did that in good faith, with all the best intentions and to avoid losing some key people.

But that was a huge mistake.

Protecting one person can sometimes put the whole team at risk.

What are other bad behaviors you should not accept in a team?

"You work hard for a month, two months, half a year, an entire year. You promise yourself you'll take a pause to recharge.

But then you don't.

More work to come, new projects, new prospects. More, more, more. Until recharging becomes impossible.

🔥 Welcome to burnout.

This silent beast is bad for your personal life and your work. It drains your energy, creativity, enthusiasm, and joy.

Been there, done that. 

How to avoid it? 

💡 Switch Your Mindset: more doesn't mean better. Working more doesn't lead to promotions; working smarter does.

🚧 Set Boundaries: define your work hours and stick to them. Make it clear to your colleagues and yourself when you're 'off the clock'.

🛑 Take Regular Breaks: short, frequent breaks throughout the day can help you maintain consistent productivity and prevent mental fatigue.

🙅 Learn to Say No: you can't do everything. Taking on too much is the surest way to burn out.

🔋 Prioritize Your Energy Sources: Family? Friends? Sports? Whatever gives you energy and joy, make it a priority.

"As humans, there’s undoubtedly one thing we continuously do, sometimes without even realizing it. 


⚖️ Taking decisions. 

Think about it. Every action we take involves some level of decision-making, and making decisions for ourselves can sometimes be challenging.

Now, imagine the complexities of decision-making within an engineering team, where multiple individuals, possibly from diverse cultures and backgrounds, are involved.

I wish I could offer you a secret recipe for making decisions in this context, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t exist (believe me, I’ve searched for it for 10 years).

However, having robust decision-making processes within your engineering team is crucial. 

Here are the benefits:

🔥 Focuses effort
🔄 Ensures consistency
⏳ Saves time
🧭 Provides direction
🛡️ Builds resilience

So, how do you make decisions? 

There are many different approaches, including:

🪖 Autocratic
🧠 Experiential
🚀 Empowered Autonomy
📊 Data-Driven
🗳️ Majority Rule
✅ Consensus

Choosing your approach depends on various factors, such as:

- Your role and leadership style
- Your risk aversion
- Your relationship with stakeholders
- Your team's culture
- Your company's environment
- The specific nature of the decisions to be made

And particularly, the area in which you must make those decisions.

Yes, it’s a lot to digest, but you’re lucky. 

As I do every Thursday, I’ve simplified a complex topic like decision-making in Engineering Teams and shared the insights with 22.1K+ people who already subscribed to The Hybrid Hacker newsletter.

"I'm a natural-born procrastinator and  I'm not ashamed to admit it. However, I have one secret to overcoming it.


 🚀 I call it MAG, which stands for Minimum Achievable Goal.


1️⃣ I wake up every morning, and I lie in bed for 10 minutes listing all my goals for the day. They are usually a lot and very ambitious.

I wish I could achieve all of them, but I know I can't.

2️⃣ While walking back from taking my daughter to kindergarten, I begin reviewing all these goals and I cut down what isn't a priority, until I'm left with three main goals for the day.

But that's not enough.

3️⃣ As soon as I'm back home, I start my journaling session; this is where I set my main goal for the day.

Just one.

This unique goal is what I absolutely have to achieve during the day.

Does this mean I'll work on just one task per day? 

Obviously not.

But focusing on just one main task when you tend to procrastinate has multiple benefits:

😔 Procrastinating feels bad. Having just one goal to achieve increases chances to feel successful during the day.

🔥 As soon as you find yourself procrastinating, you immediately know where to switch your focus instead of thinking about all your goals.

🔋 Achieving just one goal is easier, and when you do, you'll get energized by this, ending up wanting to achieve more goals.

And you? How do you fight procrastination?

"We often come across the motto 'Lead with Heart,' and, while it's intriguing, I believe it's not entirely accurate.

💡 Lead both with head and heart, instead.

This imho falls under the concept of 'Emotional Intelligence', which involves the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as the capacity to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.

But how do you achieve that?

🤔 Self-Awareness: recognize your feelings and their impact on those around you. It involves being honest with yourself and having confidence in who you are.

🌀 Self-Regulation: understand your emotions and think before reacting. Adapt to changes without losing control.

💞 Compassion: understand the feelings of others, treat them with care, without becoming emotionally involved in their experiences.

🤝 Develop Social Skills: build positive relationships and guide people effectively. Communicate transparently, resolve conflicts, and connect with others.

Curious to hear about how you work on developing your Emotional Intelligence, let me know in the comments 🙂👇

"As you might have noticed, I had to take a forced pause from LinkedIn last week.


I was at Cloudfest for work, and although I could have scheduled all my LinkedIn posts over the previous weekend, I preferred to take a week off to spend time with family, whom I wouldn't see for a week.

As someone who has always promoted consistency and who has regularly posted five times a week for months, you start to:

🔄 Feel that you're breaking your consistency habit.

🐢 Worry that others will progress faster since you're taking a pause.

🚧 Fear that what you've built will be disrupted.

This is what they call FOMO - the Fear of Missing Out.

But building consistency doesn't mean overdoing it to the point of burnout.

As I've often said, it takes time to build consistency and habits, but fortunately, it takes much more than a week of ""rest"" to disrupt them.

Taking a break is sometimes just a part of your journey towards consistency and it offers multiple benefits:

💭 It gives you time to reflect on your journey towards consistency.

🧠 It allows your brain to refresh and generate new ideas.

🔥 It helps prevent burnout, which could set you back much more than a week.

So, even if you're on your journey to consistency, don't let FOMO guide you. Have a clear path to your goals and make pauses part of it.

"There's a secret weapon that has significantly contributed to my career growth, and I believe it can help other engineers and leaders too.

🚀 Side projects.

Working on a side project offers numerous benefits:

📚 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
↳ from diving into new technologies to refining existing skills.

🥱 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗕𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗼𝗺

🏦 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
↳ build something that opens future career paths or opportunities.

However, without proper management, side projects can present challenges, including:

⏳ Time Management
🥊 Potential Conflicts with Your Current Employer
🤝 Misunderstandings with Colleagues or People you Lead
👀 Public Exposure
📉 Financial Risk
💤 Burnout

Here's the framework I use when I want to start a new side project:

- Understand the Why
- Time Allocation
- Choose the Right Project
- Set SMART Goals
- Select Tools Wisely

If you're considering starting your next side project and aim to maximize its benefits for your engineering career, today might just be your lucky day, as I've shared insights on this in The Hybrid Hacker newsletter 🤓

"Ever wondered why brilliant engineers sometimes struggle with personal finances? 🤔 


It's not just you — I've been there too, and today I want to share some hard-learned lessons about money management that are particularly relevant for engineers.

Our field presents unique financial challenges and opportunities. 

Here's why it matters:

↳ 💰 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 — great for savings, risky for overspending
↳ 🎢 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝘃𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 — job market changes and startup risks require financial cushioning
↳ 📈 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 — early financial decisions have massive long-term impacts

So where to start to fix your personal finances?

↳ 🧮 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀 — track spending, calculate savings rate (aim for 20%+)
↳ 🎯 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀 — define short-term and long-term financial objectives
↳ 📊 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝘁𝗼𝗹𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 — assess your comfort with market volatility

Once you have full control of your finances and you know your objectives, select the appropriate financial instruments:

↳ ⛑️ 𝗘𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱 — 3-6 months of expenses (I keep 12 months with a family)
↳ 🏦 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵-𝘆𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱 𝘀𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 — for short-term goals and quick access
↳ 📜 𝗕𝗼𝗻𝗱𝘀 — add stability to your portfolio
↳ 🌐 𝗘𝗧𝗙𝘀 — diversify your portfolio with a bit more risk
↳ 🎉 𝗙𝘂𝗻 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆 — small allocation for high-risk investments

The key is to start earlier, iterate, and continuously improve your financial architecture.

If you want to know more about how to improve your personal finance skills and how I allocated my financial assets, I just published a new article on The Hybrid Hacker 👇

"Wonder why some team members need more guidance than others? Spoiler: it's not about skill.

In his landmark book High Output Management, Andy Grove introduced the idea of 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸-𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆, capturing an employee's readiness to shoulder responsibility.

Grove dissects TRM into several factors, but let's focus on the two key ones:

1) 🎓 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹/𝗙𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 — the employee's expertise and readiness for the task.
2) 📋 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 — how robust and well-documented your standards are.

Both items are crucial.

Say you need to create a design doc around a new product feature. You may have the best engineer in the world, who has done hundreds of them in their career, but they still need context from you:

✔️ 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸-𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 — what tradeoffs should they consider? What about speed and scale?

🔭 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 — what do design docs look like on our team? How do you plan rollouts and rollbacks? How is the code instrumented?

The right amount of management depends on the level of TRM:

1) 🔴 𝗟𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗥𝗠 — your team hasn't done this before, and there's no existing procedure. Provide detailed instructions, pair regularly, and maintain a close feedback loop. Don't let them work too long without your input; correct often and update the procedure with your feedback.

2) 🟡 𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘂𝗺 𝗧𝗥𝗠 — your teammate has completed similar tasks before and knows what good look like, thanks to experience and/or good docs. Provide clear context about the goals, then allow them the freedom to execute.
Keep communication lines open to offer support as needed.

3) 🟢 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗧𝗥𝗠 — your teammate has completed plenty of similar tasks in the past, with good results. In this case, other than giving full autonomy, you can challenge them to improve the definition of good. What can we do better?

"Managing Up is Culturally Wrong.

Why?

Managing up is a strategy that focuses on building a univocal, productive relationship with your manager by understanding their needs, preferences, and expectations.

But promoting this practice is culturally limiting for your teams because:

📊 Reinforces Hierarchies
📉 Limits Creativity
😕 Creates Dependency
🤐 Discourages Honest Feedback
💪 Undermines Autonomy

That’s why I believe the culture of “Teaming Up” is much healthier.

Teaming up starts from the concept that managers are not special roles.

It promotes a collaborative and egalitarian approach where all team members contribute equally, share responsibilities, and support each other.

It applies the same principles as managing up, but it focuses on doing this horizontally instead of just towards one person (the manager).

These are its core principles:

👥 Mutual Understanding and Respect
🗣️ Over-communication and Feedback
🛠️ Shared Responsibility and Accountability
🤝 Collaborative Decision-Making
🌟 Supporting Each Other

I know it can all sound utopian, but it works. I have experienced that first-hand with my teams.

If you want to know more about my view on managing up and the concept of teaming up, I wrote about this in my latest newsletter issue 👇

However, learning requires a methodical approach, especially when you are no longer in your twenties.

My process is divided into different steps:

"There's one psychological phenomenon that affects most high-performing engineers, and especially managers or leaders.

What is commonly referred to as Impostor Syndrome.

Commonly, because it's not actually a recognized syndrome, but rather a psychological phenomenon.

It is believed to emerge from a combination of personality traits and situational triggers like:

🏠 Family Dynamics
🧠 Personality Traits
🌍 Cultural Factors
🏢 Workplace Environment
🏆 Early Successes/Failures
📊 Peer Comparisons

Dr. Valerie Young has identified 5 types of impostors, and they all align closely with what I've observed in my career:

🎯 The Perfectionist
💪 The Superhero
🧠 The Natural Genius
🚶‍♂️ The Soloist
📚 The Expert

While the impostor phenomenon can affect anyone, I firmly believe that the IT engineering environment is particularly fertile ground for this psychological pattern for the following reasons:


💻 Rapid Technological Changes: constant updates and new technologies make it hard to feel like an expert.

🚀 High Expectations: the push for innovation and breakthrough solutions fuels self-doubt.

🧩 Complexity and Specialization: the depth of specialization in IT can isolate professionals, making self-assessment difficult.

📊 Comparative Performance: visibility on platforms and networks leads to constant comparison with peers.

🌐 Diverse Workforce: working with a global team can intensify feelings of inadequacy.

My recipe for overcoming impostor phenomenon? 

Three things:

- Self-awareness
- Journaling
- Seek support

If you want to know more about this psychological pattern and find practical advice on how to overcome it, my newsletter is out, and I delve deep into it! 👇

"Today, if you wish to become a good Engineering Manager or Leader, there are many publicly available resources (often for FREE).

To succeed in these roles, there are three fundamental things you must do:

📚 Study these resources
⛏️ Put them into practice and tailor them to your context
♻️ Fail, adjust, and repeat

By doing this and by being genuinely committed to following this path, I can assure you that you can become a good manager or leader.

However, perhaps you aspire to be an exceptional one and excel in your role. 

In that case, there is another thing you inevitably must do.

💡 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘇𝗼𝗻𝗲.

What does that mean?

👉 There isn't a single definition, but to put it in simple words, ""leaving your comfort zone"" means intentionally stepping beyond familiar and comfortable situations or routines to face new challenges and experiences that promote personal growth and development.

In my case, for example, as an introvert, it means exposing myself to the public.

After much effort spent over the past years, today I could simply do my job of leading my department, but in the last year, I decided to:

✍️ Start writing my newsletter (The Hybrid Hacker)
🎨 Start creating and sharing my visuals
💭 Share more thoughts here on LinkedIn that sometimes don't align with the common view
🗣️ Talk more with other engineering leaders or managers to gain different perspectives
🤝 Network effectively and build new connections
🎤 Participate in public events (conferences, podcasts, etc.)
📹 Share videos with my thoughts (the most challenging)

Honestly, these are all things I wouldn't naturally do.

I do them because leaving my comfort zone is crucial to growing as a leader and striving for excellence. 

It's not mandatory; you could be just a good manager or leader. However, if you want to excel, you should consider doing this.

And you? How do you leave your comfort zone?

"How I was able to write 60+ essays and go from 400 to 27K+ newsletter subscribers in less than 10 months?

There's no secret sauce, just hard work.

First of all, I had to optimize my writing process to accommodate the 5-6 hours available weekly to create my essays.

It can be summarized in seven steps:

🎯 Choosing the Topic
✍️ Selecting the Title
💡 Collecting Ideas
📝 Creating an Outline
➕ Expanding the Outline
🔍 Proofreading the Draft
🎨 Enriching My Article

I consistently follow this process, and the more I write, the easier it becomes to write good articles.

But writing is not enough.

These are the steps I suggest you follow to grow your newsletter:

→ 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝟬 𝘁𝗼 𝟭𝗸 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀: be consistent, use social media (LinkedIn and X in particular), treat the newsletter as a brand/product, and network.

→ 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝟭𝗸 𝘁𝗼 𝟭𝟬𝗸 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀: use recommendations, engage genuinely with other writers, and consider co-authoring or conducting interviews.

→ 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝟭𝟬𝗸 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀: participate in online events (podcasts, video interviews, etc), enhance your articles, partner with other writers, and eventually use paid advertising.

There's much more I learned through this journey, and I've collected it all in a two-parts guide on how to write an Engineering Newsletter that I recently published. 

🎁 The guide is available for FREE until the end of this week! You can find it here:

"Failure is the best path to success.


This might sound counterintuitive, but listen to me:

❌ Perfection is a myth. Everything has its flaws.

↓

🧐 Sometimes, flaws are very hard to catch.

↓

✅ If you get it right from the start, it probably means you haven't encountered any unexpected failures yet.

↓

📈 On the contrary, if you fail, possibly multiple times, you've identified some potential failures and (hopefully) learned how to prevent them.

↓

💪 This doesn't necessarily mean you won't fail again, but it certainly becomes less likely. And even if you do, you already know how to handle these failures.


→ That's why fostering a culture of failure within your team is crucial.

Don't get me wrong, you don't have to celebrate failure but rather accept it as a part of a learning process.

As a general rule of thumb, you should allow individuals to fail at least once in their tasks. If they don't repeat the same mistake, this should be seen as a success because it shows they know how to learn from failure.

🚙 As Henry Ford said: 

'Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently.'

How do you deal with failure in your teams?

"A few days ago, I reached 25,000 subscribers with The Hybrid Hacker newsletter.


I know there are fellow writers who have grown much more, but for me, this achievement is simply incredible.

🙏 So, first and foremost, I want to thank all my readers, especially the 115 who decided to support me by purchasing a paid subscription.

Given the number of people reaching out for help with their newsletters and advice on growth, I decided to invest some time in giving back to this beautiful community.

📕 This led me to create The Ultimate Guide to Writing an Engineering Newsletter.

You got it right. It's a comprehensive guide that will teach you how to go from no newsletter to one with thousands of subscribers.

Here's what it covers:

🙋‍♂️ Stage 0 - Why you should start writing
❓ Stage 1 - What to write about 
🛠️ Stage 2 - Choosing your platform 
✍️ Stage 3 - Getting started with writing 
📈 Stage 4 - Growing your newsletter 
💰 Stage 5 - Monetizing your newsletter

I've condensed everything I've learned in about one year of writing and made it accessible to anyone interested in starting their writing journey.

For obvious reasons, the guide is split into two parts, and the first one was just sent out to 25.7K subscribers.

If you missed it, no worries, here's the link:

"There's one thing I've always been somewhat obsessed with since I was young.


⏱️ Time.

Between my 15 and 20, I constantly felt like I was running late.

At one point, I even theorized that, for some reason, my life was not aligned with the standard timeline. Mostly, I joked about this idea, but part of me was somewhat convinced it was true.

That's when I began trying to anticipate everything.

In every possible way, I tried to foresee the future and prepare myself for potential events.

Needless to say, I was not a Marvel superhero.

In my 30s (I know, it took a while), I finally understood that the only way to influence your future is to make good use of your time in the present.

And that's when I started using my time wisely.

How?

🎯 Defining priorities: this is the first and most important step. Be mindful of what your priorities are. Unfortunately, you can't squeeze everything into a day.

⏰ Time-boxing: instead of using to-do lists, use your calendar. This ensures that you're not overcommitting. Only what fits into your calendar will be done.

📝 Journaling: take notes of what you accomplish, how you feel, your goals, etc. This allows you to look back and see how to optimize your time.

🔄 Self-reviews: continuously review what you've accomplished, your future goals, and your priorities to help you use your time wisely.

🛑 Don't be obsessed: sometimes, it's perfectly fine to waste some time. It helps us understand its importance and motivates us to use it wisely.

What are your tips for making good use of your time?

"I'm one of those people who struggles a lot with maintaining focus during the week.


Over time, I've identified three main threats to my focus, which I call the 3 Ps:

🎯 Perfectionism: I'm a perfectionist by nature, and I love to be so, but it's demonstrated that perfectionism is counterproductive.

🌧 Pessimism: I define myself more as a realist, but this realism sometimes turns into pessimism, which transforms into paralysis.

⏳ Procrastination: I can't tell you how much I've fought this trait; it drives me crazy and is probably the main threat to my productivity.

How do I combat the 3 Ps?

✅ I've learned to aim for just ""good enough"" when I do things. Sometimes it hurts a bit, but getting things done is more rewarding.

🌈 I force myself to think positively and be a bit less cynical. It doesn't always work, but I'm getting better at it.

🚀 Overthinking is what leads me to procrastinate the most. I push myself not to overthink, to jump into things, and to eventually rework them in a second iteration.

All these things work, but it's crucial to find a good balance; otherwise, you'll end up with:

- Poor work
- Too high expectations
- Work to do again


And you? What are your main threats to your productivity?

"One particular quality has the power to significantly impact your success as a leader.


Transparency.

There's a common misconception that exceptional leaders must be strong, charismatic, and always carry a clear vision. 

While these traits are certainly beneficial, I believe their absence can be compensated by being authentic and transparent.

Being transparent with your team, especially when you are new to a leadership role, helps with:

🌟 Building Trust: being open and transparent makes it easier for your people to trust you.

🛡️ Showing Vulnerability: it's good to show you can be weak too; it helps everyone feel closer and more supportive.

💪 Sharing the Pain: being in a leadership position can sometimes be tough and frustrating; sharing your challenges with your team can lighten the burden.

🔭 Building a Vision: being clear and open makes it easier for everyone to understand and follow the plan, even when there are gaps or things that are not 100% clear.

🤝 Aligning the Team: transparency ensures everyone understands the objectives, even when these are strategic and might not appear clear to everyone.

In short, being transparent is always better, even when the news is tough. It stops people from guessing, making assumptions, and jumping to conclusions.

"As Engineering Managers or Leaders, we have a critical responsibility that we often overlook.


🔥 Preventing our team from burnout.

It may seem like an easy task, but it's not, and there are many aspects you have to consider:

🏛️ Culture: burnout prevention starts with the culture you foster. Building a collaborative culture where people help each other, instead of competing, greatly helps in preventing burnout.

😷 Prevention: have regular checkins with your team, ask them how they feel, encourage them to take holidays, and avoid working during weekends or late hours. These are all good practices to prevent burnout.

📚 Knowledge: many people don't even know what burnout means. Dedicate some time to educate your team about it so they can recognize the signs earlier.

🎯 Detection: this is one of the most challenging aspects. Recognizing when someone is burned out is already hard for the individual involved, just imagine for someone external. Again, regular checkins can help. Look for signs of fatigue, loss of enthusiasm, or disengagement.

🌱 Recovery: if someone in your team is burned out, there is still hope for them to recover, but be prepared; it won't be easy. Recovery can take a long period of complete rest (probably months) and psychological support.

I tell them that consistency is subjective; for me, it means writing five posts weekly, consistently, month after month, year after year.

🧠 I had thought about it and made the decision intentionally.

📅  I had planned for this a week in advance.

💪 It was to spend time with my family, which is more than a valid reason.

And what about showing up every day?

This concept reinforces the previous one about consistency. 

If you've committed to posting 5 times a week, consistency requires you to show up and post 5 days a week. 

This applies even if you are going to publish a post that isn't as cool as the previous one or lacks the usual visual you typically include.

Looking for a practical example?

"I am frequently asked about the essential skills that make an engineer an attractive candidate for hiring.


If you follow me, you know that technical expertise is just one of these skills.

🤔 So, what about the others?

Here is what I look for when I want to hire a great Engineer:

🗣️ Communication: this skill is essential in almost any job but is especially critical in engineering, where complex ideas must be conveyed clearly.

🌟 Adaptability: engineering often requires one to adapt to new technologies, standards, or project requirements.

🤝 Supportiveness: this trait involves being helpful and positive towards team members, which is beneficial in a collaborative environment.

💡 Creativity: while not always highlighted in engineering, creativity is important for innovation and finding unique solutions to problems.

✍️ Writing: effective written communication is crucial for documentation, reporting, and collaboration in engineering.

💼 Business Acumen: this is having a mindset that focuses on the end product, understanding how engineering decisions impact the final outcome.

🧩 Problem Solving: this is core to engineering, as our job is fundamentally about solving problems with practical solutions.

👥 Teamwork: solo engineers can be more of a burden than a benefit. Teamwork is essential for the success of engineering projects.

What are other crucial skills/traits any great engineer should have?

"There's one thing that most engineers easily overlook.


🎨 Personal Branding.

Many of them believe it's useless and rely only on their knowledge and skills. 

However, even if you're a great developer, an experienced engineer, or a thought leader, you need to be present where people are looking for you and your skills. 

🔥 LinkedIn is probably the most important platform for this purpose.

You don't have to become an influencer, and you can experience this platform in different ways:

PASSIVE EXPERIENCE
- 👀 Observe: maintain a presence on the platform while being merely an observer.
- 📚 Learn: consume LinkedIn content without engaging.

ACTIVE EXPERIENCE
- 💬 Interact: engage with content produced by others.
- ✍️ Create: produce and share your own content.

It all depends on your final goal in using this platform, but there's one thing you must do in all four cases: curate your LinkedIn profile. 

This includes:

🤓 Profile Photo
🌆 Cover Photo
📝 Headline
✍️ Bio
💡 Top Skills
🌟 Featured Content

In today's newsletter issue, I dive deep into this topic and share many tips I learned during the last 8 months on LinkedIn, where I grew from 3k to almost 25k followers.

"There's one thing that makes you feel invincible as an Engineering Leader, and it's not your title.


Your team's Trust.

Easy to say, very hard to achieve:

🏗 It takes years to build trust.
💪 It requires incredible effort.
💔 It takes just a few words to be disrupted.

Here are a few tips I learned throughout my career that will help you in building trust:

🛡 Show your vulnerabilities: it's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help and collaborate with your team members.

👂 Listen to your team: leading a team doesn't mean making decisions on your own. Take them collectively, showing trust firsthand.

🏠 Build a safe environment: if you want your team to trust you, you have to make them feel safe to share things with you.

🔄 Be consistent: Trust is built on reliability. Ensure that your actions match your promises.

📈 Provide constructive feedback: offer guidance and feedback in a way that is helpful and supportive, not critical.

🚧 Remove roadblocks: don't focus on what your team is doing; focus on what you can do to make their job easier.

"Great Engineers and Engineering Managers have one thing in common that could lead to some serious issues.


🔥 They are enthusiasts by nature.

You might think: ""Why should this be an issue? I wish I had more people like that!""

Don't get me wrong, I love Engineers and Engineering Managers who are enthusiastic and feel involved with what they do, but in the long term, these kinds of individuals are at a high risk of burnout.

So what to do?

As an Engineer:

🔧 Learn how to tame your enthusiasm: force yourself to take a pause, to disconnect, to do things that are not job-related.

🚀 Work on a side project: from my experience, side projects come with many benefits. For example, you disconnect from your job (even if your side project is related to your field) and you learn new things.

⏸ Take pauses: it doesn't matter if things have piled up, it's highly counterproductive to accept more and more priorities on your shoulders; take a pause and you'll see your productivity will benefit.

🗣 Talk to your manager: when you have too much on your plate, don't be afraid to speak with your manager. If they are good managers, they will understand; otherwise, they're not.

As an Engineering Manager or Leader:

🛀 Lead by example: taking a pause, some rest, holidays, shows your team that there's nothing wrong with that. It also prevents you from burnout.

👀 Observe and listen to your people: always keep an eye on the mood of your team, listen to their feedback, and be ready to give them the time they need to recharge.

🌴 Create a culture where rest and holidays are not seen as a perk, but as a natural need for everyone.

What do you do to avoid burnout?

"There's one thing every Engineer, and especially Engineering Leaders, should never do.


 Blindly follow trends.

In almost three decades of experience with technology, I can confidently say that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions.

👉 Microservices are not inherently better than monoliths, and vice versa.
👉 Public Cloud is not inherently better than Private Cloud, and vice versa.
👉 Mono-repo is not inherently better than Multi-repo, and vice versa.

You often see these kinds of debates on LinkedIn or Twitter, and they remind me of the never-ending battle between Windows and Linux fans. I've been there too when I was younger (I was on the Linux side).

What experience has taught me is that every technology has its pros and cons, and most importantly, specific use cases. 

This was true for Windows and Linux as well. Even though Windows was often criticized for being unstable (believe me, it was), it was frequently the only choice for desktops in companies and governments. 

Why? Because it came with a name, support, certifications, and a plethora of tools for office work (open-source alternatives were not there yet).

So, what's the point?

As a software/system engineer or leader, you must always make choices based on your needs, not on trends:

📝 Define your requirements clearly and write them down.

🗣️ Discuss these requirements with your team to understand the trade-offs.

🔍 Conduct some risk analysis to be aware of potential issues you might encounter with a certain technology.

🚀 Once you've made a choice, don't listen to trends. It's fine to pivot as your project progresses, but make those changes based on needs, not on what others are saying.

"There's one issue I often encounter with Engineering Teams who are building products.


😊 They think they know what customers want.

It must be said that when this happens, you are already in a good position because you are working with engineers who are product-minded.

However, their enthusiasm for the product and the desire to develop new technology often lead to building things that, in our minds, are killer features, while in the customers' minds, they are not.

So, what should you do?

🧠 Don't try to think like your customers: you are an engineer building products for customers; you won't be able to think like they do. Listen to them directly instead.

📊 Work with your Product Team: understand the real customer needs, coming from their feedback, surveys, interviews, etc.

🔧 Support the Product Team: focus on building tools that support product teams understand what the customer really needs. Implement feature flags, canary releases, and robust pipelines that allow for quickly reverting changes that didn't work.

And my frequent response is:

""Have you ever considered what you're doing to support your team before complaining that they're not doing what you want?""

The old saying ""What you give is what you get"" can be a valuable guide.

As an Engineering Leader, your main responsibilities are:

🚧 Helping your team overcome any obstacles that might make their work harder.

🛡️ Protecting them from unnecessary politics.

👂 Listening to their problems and trying to help find solutions.

📝 Giving actionable feedback to help them grow.

🎉 Celebrating their successes, no matter how small.

"There's a crucial aspect to consider today, whether you're an Engineering Manager growing your team or an Engineer within a team.

Product-mindset.

Why are Product-Minded Engineers so important?

- They bring Innovative Solutions
- They are efficient when it comes to Development
- They tend to avoid Over-Engineering
- They help with Product Strategy
- They have an Holistic Understanding

So how to recognize or become a Product-Minded Engineer? 

Let me provide you with a precise identikit

🎯 Strategic Thinker: understands the company's broader goals and aligns their work with these objectives.

🌉 Communication Bridge: excellent at communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, fostering understanding across different teams.

🛠️ Tech Expert: has strong technical skills and is able to implement efficient and innovative solutions.

📊 Data-Driven: makes informed decisions based on data, mixing analytical skills with creative problem-solving.

🚀 Entrepreneurial Soul: has an entrepreneurial mindset, actively seeking out and creating new solutions to real-world problems.

🤝 Collaborative: works effectively with product managers, designers, and other team members, contributing to a healthy team dynamic.

🔍 User-Centric: prioritizes user happiness and focuses on solving real user problems, ensuring the product meets market demands.

📈 Business Oriented: understands and contributes to the business side of the product, aiming to achieve strategic business goals.

💡 Problem Solver: skilled at identifying issues and implementing efficient solutions, often foreseeing potential problems before they arise.

🌍 Big Picture Perspective: keeps an eye on industry trends and the competitive landscape, understanding where the product fits in the market.

There's much more to learn about growing as a Product-Minded engineer, and I wrote about that in my last newsletter issue. 👇

"How I was able to hit 20k followers on Linkedin in less than 7 months last weekend?


No secrets, it just required a lot of hard work. 

But there are a few key takeaways I can share to help you.

🪖 Consistency and Discipline: as with everything you do, consistency and discipline play the most significant roles. Showing up every day and hitting the publish button, even when you feel your writing isn't perfect, is crucial.

👥 Networking: social networks like Linkedin are built on people, and people are essential for engagement. Build a small community within your niche, offer genuine help and support to others without expecting anything in return. While not everyone, many of these people will support you in your future journey.

💡 Provide Value: especially on Linkedin, people aren't looking for friends; they're seeking support. Don't write just for the sake of it; strive to add value and create actionable content that helps people improve and succeed. This also applies to comments on others' posts. People will show their appreciation.

 🙌 Be Authentic: don't try to show a different version of you. We are all human, and experiencing failures is a significant part of gaining valuable experience. This is what people want to hear and relate to. They're not looking for flawless superheroes; they want authenticity.

😓 Not Everyone Will Like You: as your visibility grows, you'll discover that some people won't like you or your content, and in some cases, you may encounter ""haters"". Don't engage with them. It's perfectly acceptable to have disagreements and engage in thoughtful discussions, but when you encounter individuals who are simply trolling or spreading hate, don't waste your energy.

🎨 Keep It Simple and Visual: people don't have time to spend hours reading and understanding your posts. Use short paragraphs, bullet lists, emojis, and visuals when possible. Learning how to create visuals may take a bit of time, but it's a valuable skill in many situations.

📊 Don't Focus (too much) on Numbers: I'm not going to tell you that post statistics, follower counts, and likes are not important. They are how success is often measured on this platform. However, they are not the only things that matter, and they can be influenced by the platform itself. During your journey, you will experience ups and downs, so don't become obsessed; it's quite normal. Always look at the long term.

🌟 Enjoy: one last suggestion I want to give you is to enjoy your journey and not take it too seriously. At the end of the day, while gaining visibility on Linkedin can be beneficial for your business or your ego, it's not everything, and imho, there are many other important things.

"Estimates are not deadlines.

They get treated like them though.

Here's why:

Your manager or PM asks, ""How long will this take?""...
The response: ""It would take me 3 days""

Without realizing it, an implicit agreement was just made: ""If I work on this, I'm agreeing to finishing it within 3 days.""

But here's the crazy part 🤯: Your manager or PM probably didn't even want that agreement!

They also would have been ok with:
• ""It's a small""
• ""Finishing it within a sprint seems reasonable""
• ""I'd need to dig in more to give more certainty. Do you just need a rough guess?""

Many times, they just need a rough idea so they can prioritize.

And yes, there are cases where even when you do this, that initial ballpark number you threw out gets treated like a deadline. 

But, having tried this in practice, those rarely happen when you answer very explicitly.

If it does happen, you can now say, ""At the time, I let you know it was a rough guess. If we need more certainty, I'll need to spend time scoping.""

Make it clear what you are agreeing and not agreeing to.

"Today, I want to share an hard truth about being a leader, a lesson I've learned firsthand. 


Many individuals on LinkedIn provide recipes for becoming successful and thoughtful leaders, and I must admit that sometimes, I do the same.

🌀 However, the reality is that the journey to becoming a successful leader is tough and far from linear.

It's filled with both highs and lows, and at times, it may not even feel rewarding.

Here are some of the challenges you will encounter:

🤝 As you progress as a leader, you'll often find yourself increasingly distant from hands-on work, and imposter syndrome may become the norm.

🛠️ Those who are hands-on may not fully understand your role and may perceive it as unnecessary.

🏆 Your victories won't just belong to you; they will be the team's successes.

😔 However, losses won't just impact the team; you'll personally feel their weight.

🚶‍♂️ Leadership can often feel lonely, especially if you struggle to establish a strong connection with your teams.

So, why am I sharing this with you? Am I trying to discourage you from pursuing the path of leadership?

No, quite the opposite! I want you to be well-prepared.

The path to leadership is challenging, but most importantly, it's a choice. Unfortunately, many people find themselves in leadership positions they never desired.

True servant leadership involves prioritizing your teams and occasionally making sacrifices for their success. However, this is also where you'll find your greatest satisfaction. 

If leadership is your choice, seeing your teams succeed can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your career.

(Can you guess the track on the right? 😀)

"I observed hundreds of people succeeding in their careers, projects, lives, and I was able to isolate their DNA.


It's simpler than you might have thought, but very challenging to ""clone"".

Their DNA is composed of two main interconnected elements:

💪 Discipline: serves to maintain consistency.
🔄 Consistency: helps cultivate discipline.

So, are these traits truly impossible to replicate? No.

After extensive ""scientific"" research, I've discovered practical ways to cultivate these traits:

🎯 Set a SMART Consistency Goal: pick one meaningful activity. It could be working out 3 days/week, writing 5 Linkedin posts/week, or spending 2 hrs time with loved ones every day. Just ensure it to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

📓 Journal Your Journey: track your progress and reflect on the challenges.

🌱 Embrace Imperfection: accept that inconsistency happens. It's part of the journey, not a reason to stop.

🎉 Celebrate Milestones: reward yourself for the small wins.

🎁 BONUS
Share your consistency goal and progress publicly: sharing your goals with others can significantly boost your motivation.

My main consistency goal this year, identical to last year, is to write and share meaningful things with my audience every day here on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as weekly in my newsletter (find all links in the first comment).

Now I'm curious. What is your consistency goal for 2024? Share it in the comments and let's support each other in our journeys to success!

"As Engineering Managers or Leaders, mastering some gardening knowledge can be a game-changer.


Yes, you read that right. Gardening!

😅 I must admit, I'm not really good at gardening. But there is one skill from gardening that is just as important for Engineering Managers who want to grow their teams. 

Patience.

Growing a team is pretty similar to cultivating a garden. It's a long-term game, not a sprint. 

What does it involve?

🌱 Planting Seeds: just like a gardener, you'll sow many seeds. Not all will sprout, but each one has potential.

⏳ The Long Term Game: growth takes time. You might spend months, or even years, before seeing tangible results.

💧 Regular Care: consistent 1:1s are like watering your plants. They provide essential nutrients, helping your team grow healthy.

🌸 The Bloom: eventually, your team will flourish. When this happens, it's time to celebrate their success. This moment is just as crucial as the entire journey of growth.

Remember, patience is key. Cultivate it and watch your team succeed!

"I often hear managers or leaders say, 'you have to earn my trust' and I find this approach incredibly wrong.


✨ Trust by default. 

As a leader or manager, you should be the one taking the risk to invest in people by showing that you trust them, not the other way around.

Trusting people by default:

🤝 Builds stronger relationships 
💡 Encourages personal growth 
🔐 Makes people accountable for their jobs

Sometimes it will go well; other times, some may not handle the trust you've placed in them. While tough, that's part of your investment, and there are often ways to manage it:

💬 Give Feedback and Support: provide constructive feedback. Let the individual know where they fell short and offer support to help them improve.

🎯 Re-evaluate Expectations: ensure that your expectations were clear from the beginning. If not, clarify them now.

📈 Create a Plan: develop a clear plan with goals and check-ins to gradually rebuild trust.

Ultimately it's important to recognize when it might be time to part ways. If trust is repeatedly broken, it may be best for both parties to move on.

How about you? Do you trust people by default?

"I often hear people say that follower counts, impressions, and other numbers are just vanity metrics and that they are not important. This is simply a misconception!

It's true, numbers are not everything, but they are important for three main reasons:

- They are often associated with vanity, I associate them with personal reward, which is crucial for maintaining consistency.
- Some numbers indicate public validation, which is essential to avoid being self-referential.
- Although not all numbers are meaningful metrics, those that are can provide insight into your growth.

These are some of my numbers for 2023 I'm proud of:

"There's one secret I used over the past few years to maintain high engagement among my teams, especially during periods of intense work.


💡 R&D. 

In my teams, every team member has two mandatory days per month dedicated to Research and Development.

They are free to experiment with anything, as long as it's related to our field in some way, and they are encouraged to present the results of their R&D to the wider team.

This not only keeps them engaged but also has a number of other benefits:

🚀 Dedicated time for research and development fuels innovation and growth.

📚 Diving deep into your field and staying updated helps in making informed decisions.

📢 Presenting your findings is a useful public speaking exercise and it's great for knowledge sharing.

🌳 It provides a breather during highly intensive periods of work, helping to avoid burnout.

🎁 Sometimes, this R&D translates into new features for our products or entirely new projects we hadn't previously considered.

How much time do you or your team dedicate to R&D?

"Writing Tech Specs is often one of the toughest and most frustrating parts of developing software.

Here are some reasons why it's a pain:

🤔 Complexity: these documents need to include a lot of details, which can make them complicated and hard to write.

⏰ Time-Consuming: writing good tech specs takes a lot of time, which can slow down the start of the actual coding work.

👥 Different Needs: different people, like programmers, managers, and clients, all need different things from the tech specs. It's hard to make a document that works for everyone.

❓ Uncertainty: early in a project, you might not know everything. Writing specs with too many unknowns can lead to having to change them later.

🤝 Needs Teamwork: creating tech specs needs input from many people, and getting everyone to work together well can be hard.

What are your tips and tricks to make this process smoother?

But that's not quite right. Leadership isn't a solo job.

👥 It's about a group of people working together to achieve a common goal.

👨‍💼 Leading a team is a regular job, with its own duties, responsibilities, and challenging moments.

💪 An important part of being a good leader is knowing that you don't have to do everything alone. Your main role is to empower people to achieve objectives.

🌟 The best leaders also understand that their team is there not only to help reach goals but also to share ideas, provide support, and make tough times easier.

"You can strive for money, success, public recognition, or anything, but there's one thing that will beat them all.


⏰ Time.

Time is what you need to achieve all of the above. Without time, you can't.

But time, like your energy, is limited.

That's why you have to protect and allocate it to what truly matters to you, not to others.

How?

Learn to say no.

🤷‍♂️ Many people still believe that always saying yes, accepting everything, will take them far because others will remember that.

Wrong.

👉 The only thing they will remember is that there's someone (you) giving away their time to anyone, allowing them to save their own.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't give away free time or help others for free; it just means you have to do it consciously.

Even when your time is paid.

Because every time you say ""yes"" without thinking, just to be a kind person, you are automatically saying no to someone or something else.

Someone who may have been more in need?
Something that might have had more value?

I don't know. You should know it, and you should learn to say no.

"They often ask me what skills every Engineering Manager should have and what traits to avoid.

Unfortunately, there's no user manual, nor a right answer. There are so many skills and traits that it would be hard to list them all.

For this reason, as an exercise, I wanted to find five for each group that, for me, are essential or to avoid. 

Skills you should seek in a good EM:

🗣️ Communication: this is simply crucial. As an EM, you'll have to provide feedback, build relationships with stakeholders, and articulate your vision.

🤲 Delegation: I don't like the word ""delegation""; I prefer giving ownership. But it conveys the idea.

💻 Tech Expertise: as an EM, you don't need to code all the time or be the best in the room, but you need to have a good general understanding of what's going on.

❤️ Compassion: manage with heart. A team that feels supported is a team that delivers. Your primary duty as an EM is people.

🧠 Problem Solving: you can excel in all the other four areas, but what upper management usually wants is for you to solve problems.

Traits to Minimize or Avoid:

🔎 Micro-Managing: empower your team, give them freedom, and let them take ownership of what they do.

🚧 Inflexibility: In both management and leadership, adaptability is key. Adapt or die.

🧐 Egocentrism: many think that being a manager puts them at the top of the hierarchy. False. You are there to serve your team; there's no place for egocentrism.

🌫️ Lack of Transparency: don't be afraid to share the challenges with your team. It will make them more responsible and ease your burden.

🌧️ Negativity: being transparent even when things are tough is fine; having a negative attitude is not. You are there to uplift your team.

"Feedback is what oils and fuels relationships between individuals, so it’s one of the main drivers of success in a team.

👷🏻‍♂️ But giving feedback is not a simple task and is often taken lightly.

I'm well known for being a very direct and transparent person (sometimes too much), so I don't have problems giving feedback.

However, over the years, I have had to put in tremendous effort to fine-tune the way I give it.

It's not just about the form; it's about the process of giving feedback. 

✅🛑 We often tend to distinguish between positive and negative feedback, while feedback (at least from my perspective) is just a building block, a part of the process of building relationships.

To help me with this, inspired by other frameworks, I created a simple one to assist me in this process.

You can call it PCI, and it has three main phases:

🔍 Prepare: to gather information about the behavior you'd like to change.

✉️ Communicate: to articulate and provide the feedback.

📈 Improve: to make the feedback actionable and follow up on the results.

Each phase focuses on aspects that I believe are crucial when you have to give feedback, especially if it's part of complex situations.

"Since I was young, as an introvert, I always enjoyed guessing what other people were thinking, and I believe I became good at it. 
 
At the same time, one of the first things I learned on my leadership journey is to put this 'guessing' skill aside. 
 
You can be great at guessing what others think, but nothing is as effective as just listening to them. 
 
And listening is a skill you have to learn and develop through practice: 
 
🤔 Be Curious: ask questions. Be genuinely interested in what your team has to say. 
 
🛡️ Create Safe Spaces: encourage open communication where team members feel safe to share their thoughts without judgment. 
 
👂 Listen Actively: show that you're listening by acting on the feedback received. It's not just about hearing; it's about integrating that feedback into real change. 
 
📅 Check-in Regularly: schedule regular moments (1:1 meetings, retrospectives, brainstormings, etc.) to understand the challenges and ideas your team may have. 
 
📝 Journal and Reflect: take time to reflect on the feedback. Sometimes the best insights come from thinking deeply about what you've heard. 
 
And you? Are you guessing or listening?

"Today is my birthday! 🎂

In true leadership fashion, I'm taking a step back for some quality 'team building' and 'strategic planning' with myself, for an exciting new year of life.

Here's how a leader celebrates a birthday without the cake:

🧠 Reflecting: taking stock of the past year's achievements and learning moments.

👀 Vision Setting: imagining new opportunities for the coming year and setting fresh goals.

⛷️ A Different Kind of Treat: who says you need a cake to celebrate? My go-to is skiing; snow powder over sugar any day!

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Enjoying the Moment: spending quality time with loved ones, because leadership also means nurturing your personal community.

I'll be back to regular insights about engineering management and leadership tomorrow, but for today, let's all remember the importance of pausing to celebrate the milestones in our journey.

"Especially if you are an enthusiastic individual like I am, defining priorities is one of the most challenging tasks. 

But it's crucial:

🩺 For your health
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 For your loved ones
👨‍💻 For your career
🏆 For your success

I previously wrote about the importance of saying NO. The concept is essentially the same; you have to learn to say NO to yourself. It can be even more challenging than saying no to other people, especially if you are affected by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), like I am.

So, what should you do? It's simple.

👉 Start by writing down all your priorities; simple things like:

- Taking care of my family
- Succeeding in my job
- Being consistent with my newsletter
- Growing my LinkedIn network
- Creating engaging visuals
- Writing a book
- Reading 2 books per month
- Skiing more
- Playing with my 3D printer
- Going hiking
- ...whatever comes to your mind!

These are just some examples from my list, which consists of over 50 items today.

Then, after some time, take this list and begin ranking all the items until you have them in order of importance. It may take a while, but push yourself to ensure that no items share the same ranking position.

✅ Once you've finished, select the top 5 items and remove all the others (keep them for future reference). Depending on your energy levels, you can consider doing 4 or maybe 6, but I find 5 to be the magic number.

🔥 These are the areas where you should focus in the coming months.

After a few months, repeat this exercise.

How do you manage your priorities?

"6 different strategies to become a CTO.

1. Start a company
This is the route of a lot of uncertainty and continuous learning on the job. But the returns on this may be immense.

2. Become a founding engineer
This is especially for someone who is good at building MVPs.

3. Go through the Management path
The more you grow in the management path, the more you become a good fit for mid+ size companies as a CTO.

4. Go through the Architecture path
This might be a good path for you if you like to still stay in technical details and you love to design great systems. But keep in mind that as a CTO of mid+ size companies, you won’t be doing that anymore.

5. Go through the IC path
You are a good fit for small-size companies, but you will need to learn the management skills for mid+ size companies.

6. Become a CTO through other roles, mostly Product
I’ve seen where CTOs come from roles such as DevOps (Head of DevOps), QA (Head of QA), etc. but I’ve also seen where a CPO or Head of Product transitioned to either a CTPO (Chief Technology and Product Officer) or pure CTO role.

"Make sure to try to avoid the New Leader Syndrome as an engineer.

What I like to call a “New Leader Syndrome” is when you feel that you need to showcase an extraordinary amount of effort or competence to justify that you deserve to lead that project or team.

And for every individual, it shows up differently:

1. Working extra hours and staying a long time in the office to “show” everyone how great and committed you are

2. Trying to be the best at everything, while also leading the team

3. Always being available and quickly responding to every question

4. It’s also common for more experienced leaders as well, and it shows when they feel pressured to make quick, visible changes to prove their value

So, this is my advice: When you first step into leadership, it’s common to feel the need to prove yourself by doing more. Extra effort at the beginning is normal, but if you make it unsustainable, that’s not.

Leadership is not about being perfect or doing everything yourself. It’s about solving the right problems, setting clear expectations, and enabling others to succeed.

"Coinbase scaled their hiring to 150 engineers per month over the pandemic.

How did they do it?

1. They standardized the searches

Previously, for every new hire, it would be required to draft a “job spec”. With standardization, you could only hire a frontend engineer, a backend engineer, a crypto engineer, an infra engineer, or an ML engineer (and a few others).

2. They moved from hiring in SF only to nationwide

And later to 10+ countries. This resulted in a massive increase in talent pool size.

3. Interviewing became centralized

Candidates weren't screened by their future hiring manager or peers anymore, but rather by any Coinbase engineer. This massively opened up the interviewer capacity.

4. From hiring manager round-ups to centralized hiring panels

Each day with a rotation, one Coinbase leader would host a hiring panel (with 5-6 senior managers), where all the interview packets feedbacks were reviewed and decided which ones would move to offer and which ones would be rejected.

This gave them the ability to process 40-50 candidates at the pre-offer stage a day.

5. The offers became standardized and non-negotiable

No back and forth with the candidate. Both base salary and equity were directly related to the level you would be hired in, no exceptions allowed.

3. Share with them a Loom video of a certain suggestion, or improvement that would benefit the org/team. A popular suggestion these days is connected with AI adoption and AI-assisted engineering practices.

4. Submit the application with the CV and let the hiring manager know that you’re looking forward to having a talk with them.

"Differences between the Architect and the Tech Lead roles.

Architect:
- Work across different teams
- Design systems organization-wide,
- Define technology standards and patterns

Tech Lead:
- Part of one team
- Responsible for the technical implementation of the specific project
- Coaching, mentoring, planning, stakeholder management

What I like to say about the Architect role is that you need to think in years and not in sprints. Making good long-term decisions is where your main focus should be.

I normally introduce this role when the tech leads of the team can’t align on the architecture, and where inconsistencies of the implementations tend to happen across different teams.

Both the Tech Lead and the Architect roles usually have no direct reports and rely on influence rather than authority.

"My top 5 tips to become a great engineering leader in 2026.

1. Make sure to lead in an AI-native world

- For CTOs, VPs, Directors, and Heads of Engineering -> You should own the AI strategy
- For EMs, Architects, Senior+ Engineers -> You should be the one who is setting a good example of what good AI-assisted engineering practices are.

2. Build your network outside of your company

It has increasingly become important for engineering leaders to be able to manage expectations well, especially when it comes to AI tools or adopting AI in general.

If you want to manage expectations well, you need to know and understand what tools other organizations use and why they use them. And the best way to do that is to have people in your network that you can talk to outside of your current company.

3. Become better at communication and/or tech skills

Both are going to be more and more important, especially stakeholder communication, which is becoming increasingly harder now that AI is involved in the process, and at the same time, you can’t do AI-assisted engineering well if your tech skills are not at a good level.

4. Building the right things is more important than ever

That’s another important aspect that you need to put a lot of focus on. When your team can be more productive, it becomes even more crucial that the productivity is moved in the right direction.

5. Invest in your own sustainability

The role of engineering leaders is increasingly becoming more demanding and more stressful than it was some time ago. So, make sure to realize the following -> burned-out leaders create burned-out teams.

You need to ensure that your work is sustainable for the long run and not just for the short sprint.

"Leadership isn’t always about being in the front seat.

Sometimes, the most effective move is to step back.

When you do, you create space for someone on your team to step up, take ownership, and grow. At the same time, you free yourself to focus on higher-level, strategic work.

The result?
- You become a stronger leader
- Create a more capable team
- You create leaders

A win-win-win.

"When I was a Senior Software Engineer, I felt stuck.

I was overthinking about my career path, and I didn’t know which particular skills I should focus on:
- “What is going to be that next step for me?”
- “Should I go into management, architecture, or should I grow as an IC?”
- “What particular skills should I be learning next?”

These questions were always on my mind.

My growth was stagnating because I wasn’t intentional about my growth, and I didn't have defined goals.

And that's where we, as engineering leaders, should help as much as possible. To help our people define their growth goals.

"When people feel like they are growing, that’s when they feel the most motivated.

This is really important to understand as an engineering leader, because you are playing a big part in defining the overall culture inside your team and also in your organization.

And it all starts with the clarity of defining goals for your people.

- Do they want to become a Staff Engineer, an Architect, or a Manager? 
- Are they happy where they are at the moment and wish to grow by learning a new skill? 
- What does growth actually mean for them?

Those are all very important questions that, as leaders, we should definitely help our engineers find answers to!

How to do that, you may ask?

"Switching off from work is a skill like any other. Make sure to practice it over the holidays.

Especially if you are an engineering leader, it's really important to switch off regularly. Always keep in mind that as an engineering leader, you are setting an example.

If you work:
- Long hours, weekends, over the holidays
- You always respond to Slack messages fast, even at unusual times
- You send emails overnight, etc.

You are setting an example and expectations for your whole team.

The whole team feels like they need to do the same, or else they might feel that they are not doing the work up to the expectations.

Which ultimately can lead people to burn out, while they are doing great work → all because of misaligned expectations.

Switching off won’t make you less committed. It makes you more sustainable, and it will make your team stronger, because it gives room to others to step up when you’re not there.

It will also allow you to enjoy the career you’re working so hard to build.

It’s Christmas Eve today 🎄, and many of you are celebrating Christmas and enjoying the holidays, me included :) I always like to use this time to reflect, recharge, and prepare for a successful upcoming year!

In today's article on my newsletter Engineering Leadership, I am sharing the 5 most important lessons and findings impacting engineering & engineering leadership this year.

These lessons/findings are:

1. The narrative “AI is replacing software engineers” is simply not true

2. The negative perception of AI was caused by sensationalistic takes from well-known public individuals

3. Managing expectations has become THE job for engineering leaders

4. The roles are getting closer together

5. Being a multiplier is a must in the AI-era

"My top 5 tips for AI-assisted engineering:

1. Make sure to take full accountability and ownership

Treat all AI-generated code as your own responsibility. Test it, review it, and make sure that you completely understand it before submitting. It should never happen that you submit a line of code without knowing what it actually does.

2. Use AI as a thought partner, and not just blindly trust

Don’t use AI on autopilot, treat it like a co-pilot instead. Ask to explain concepts, generate boilerplate, or explore solutions, but never let it replace your role in critical thinking, system design, or architectural decisions.

Your pragmatism, intuition, domain knowledge, and ability to evaluate trade-offs are irreplaceable.

3. Prioritize understanding over speed

Focusing purely on faster delivery can be dangerous if it comes at the cost of a lack of understanding. Your workflow should never look like “copy-paste and pray”.

Take the time to review and internalize what the LLM generates.

4. There should always be a person responsible, full automation is not a reality in AI-assisted engineering

Don’t aim for full automation. AI in software development should always include human oversight, especially in critical systems.

From planning and design through to implementation and testing, there should always be a real engineer making the final call.

5. AI amplifies existing practices, so make sure to focus on developing them

This is really important to understand: “AI tools amplify what you already do.”
If you know how to build the right way, AI boosts your productivity. If not, it magnifies bad habits.

"The mistake engineers make when working with AI coding tools.

What I am seeing and also hearing happening regularly, especially with less experienced engineers, is the following:

1. They are assigned a task, and they use a certain AI coding tool, use their agent mode to finish the task.

2. They don’t go the extra mile to actually understand what has been changed and ensure the changes are made within the guidelines of the codebase.

3. They open the PR.

And because they didn’t REALLY take ownership and ensure they are delivering good quality code, this puts a lot of pressure on reviewers to find all the mistakes and completely shifts the work on them.

There may be a lot of comments on PRs, and it takes a lot of time to review correctly.

And even in some cases, engineers give up and just approve the PR, which makes things a lot worse in the long run.

Crucial thing to understand here is that AI is like any other tool, and it’s here to help us, not to shift the accountability from the person submitting a PR to AI, which should NEVER happen.

Always take ownership and accountability for your actions and decisions, and don't blame AI for the output that YOU used.

"How to start with public speaking as an engineer or engineering leader?

Giving talks at events and conferences has really been one of the most rewarding things for me.

It feels great when you get to share knowledge, and people learn something new that helps them to become a better engineer or engineering leader.

But not just that, you get to learn new things as well, because when you are preparing to give a talk, you are cementing your knowledge on that topic.

This is my advice on how to get started:

1. Start looking for opportunities to share knowledge across your organization

This should be the first thing you focus on if you don't already, and you can start really small. No need to volunteer for presenting across the whole organization right from the jump. Remember that small steps eventually lead to big results.

2. Present at a local meetup

After you share your knowledge internally, look to share it with other people as well, outside of your org. Presenting at a local meetup is a great way to gain experience speaking in a low-stakes situation. Everyone is there to learn and have a good time.

3. Start applying to present at a conference

After you get experience at a local meetup, you should start applying for talks at conferences. It is important to mention that you don’t need to be an all-time amazing public speaker to have a talk. In our industry, the substance is the most important thing, not that you have 10/10 public speaking skills.

"Engineers must become multipliers in the AI-era.

The reason?

As tools for development have gotten better, the desired skills for engineers have moved from just pure knowing programming languages and frameworks (expected) to problem-solving abilities and people skills.

But what does it actually mean to be an engineering multiplier?

Being an engineering multiplier means being someone who amplifies the productivity and effectiveness of the engineers around them, not just focusing on their own output, but elevating the entire team.

An engineering multiplier doesn’t just ask, “What can I build?”, they ask, “How can I make everyone around me more effective?”.

And this is what multipliers are doing. They are:
- Improving team efficiency
- Sharing knowledge
- Raising the quality bar
- Enabling better decisions
- Mentoring and empowering others

"Do enterprise companies even use AI?

This was the question that came up frequently in some of the conversations I had with engineers and engineering leaders across the industry.

Ever since the increase in popularity of AI tools → many people have been doubtful regarding security, sharing sensitive data, and overall compliance factors regarding the usage of such tools.

This has been especially prevalent in enterprise companies, as many have previously chosen to restrict such tools.

"This is how I do a full engineering org audit.

As a Fractional CTO and advisor, one of the common things that I did a couple of times this year was an engineering organizational audit.

I use the same approach as I would use in the first 90 days if I were to start a new full-time engineering leadership role.

1. The first thing I do is to really understand the pain points
In some cases, they have secured new funding and would like to scale and focus on hiring. Another reason may be that the CTO has left the company, and they would like to do a good overview of the current org before making any decisions.

2. The second thing I do is have 1:1s with the relevant people
The 3 main questions I normally ask here are:
- How are you feeling about your current work and projects?
- What do you believe is going well, and what could be improved?
- How can I support and help you?

3. Following, I go through all the relevant parts of the engineering org
I normally combine the second and this step together, as I am able to ask much better questions if I understand certain parts much better. I go through the documentation, check the codebase, overall architecture, and also assess all of the different parts:
- Hiring
- Culture
- Continuous growth
- Knowledge sharing
- Planning and alignment
- Onboarding process
- Release process
- Development process
- Incident management process
- Security

4. Provide suggestions for improvements and present the findings
I make sure I note all the important info in the board and finish by providing my suggestions for improvements. After I have everything prepared, I present my findings together with my suggestions.

"What do I look for in a Senior Software Engineer as a manager?

There are so many different things that make a senior engineer. If I can sum all of them in 1 sentence, that would be:

A senior engineer should be able to independently understand the problem and find the right solution to it.

I am not just talking about technical solutions here. I mean solutions across different areas including communication, collaboration, mentoring and helping others.

And by no means do I mean that you need to have the right answers on the spot. A senior engineer is able to find and gather solutions from various of different sources.

Software engineering is too broad of a field to be an expert in everything or to know everything upfront.

"This is what I would do if I would be looking for a new engineering/engineering leadership role.

1. First, I would make sure that my CV is on point
It's the first impression that a hiring manager gets of you, and you must leave a good one.

2. Ensure that my LinkedIn profile is updated and optimized
Personally, LinkedIn has been huge for my career, as almost all the roles I've gotten have come through it. Either people contacted me directly, referred me, or I applied to a specific role.

3. Find 3-5 roles that fit with what I would be looking for
The reason for this is that the strategy called “spray and pray”, where you just send infinite CVs to infinite companies, normally doesn’t work so well, as companies receive a LOT of submissions.

4. Find the hiring manager or recruiter responsible for the role on LinkedIn
I would contact that person through LinkedIn and ask them a few questions about the role. Something that would be interesting for me to know and that would give me a better overview of what I can expect.

5. I would try to stand out in this step already
I would record a video, it would be a Loom video or something else, where I would share improvements (suggestions) to the product or service related to the company I am applying to. I would submit my CV and send the hiring manager the video.

Even though this takes more time, especially if you are doing this for 3-5 companies, it’s a LOT better approach than just sending CVs and hoping for the best.

Doing this will make it impossible for a hiring manager to ignore you.

"My advice for engineers looking for new roles (especially with less experience).

Try to look for unfair advantage when applying to roles or when you are already in the hiring process.

After my first two student jobs as an engineer, I started to apply for my first full-time engineering position.

I applied to the role that I liked and the first interview went well. I was invited to the second interview.

Before that interview, I designed + coded a new website for them. I designed it with Photoshop and built it with HTML + CSS + JS and a bit of PHP.

They liked it and gave me good feedback.

The next day, I received an email where they offered me the position, which wouldn't happen if I didn't do that. I was ecstatic.

You can see how the site looked like in the picture below.

So, my advice is:
Try to do something to stand out when you apply to the role or when you are already in the hiring process.

"A lot of engineers are curious about what the future will bring.

And what the core skills to focus on are in the AI era.

I recently had the pleasure to speak with John Crickett about the topic of how AI is impacting specifically engineers and his tips for thriving in the AI era.

We talked about a LOT of things, including:
- Core skills that engineers should prioritize today
- Habits that engineers should focus on
- The mindset behind exploring AI tools
- Misusing AI → what to avoid
- Areas that will become more valuable in the next 1–5 years
- Engineering fundamentals being the key to future-proof careers
- Important things to do as a junior engineer
- What John would focus on if he were to start his career today

"In today’s AI era, being a great engineer is no longer defined by your individual contribution alone.

Being a great engineer is defined by the ability to make others around you better, to deliver projects successfully, and to create impact that moves the whole organization forward.

There are many ways to multiply your efforts:
- making your whole team better,
- to work well across different teams,
- be a multiplier through systems,
- multiply and scale through people.

These are all archetypes of multipliers, where each provides immense impact in its own specific way.

To learn about how to become a specific multiplier archetype, read my latest article I sent to 173k+ engineering leaders yesterday: https://lnkd.in/eDyTMzes",50.0,27.0,5,,,Teacher,Engineering/Technical,Insight/Observation,Listicle/Breakdown,Text-only,"In today’s AI era, being a great engineer is no longer defined by your individual contribution alone.","In today’s AI era, being a great engineer is no longer defined by your individual contribution alone.

"3 real-world examples of AI/ML Engineers -> their stack, challenges, and day-to-day focus.

With the increase in popularity of AI, roles such as AI Engineer and ML Engineer are becoming more and more popular.

In order to understand the roles much better, I’ve asked 3 AI/ML Engineers to share their real-world experience:
- How does their day-to-day look like
- What technologies do they work with
- Specific challenges they are facing
- How does the work differ from Software Engineering

These are the 3 engineers I had the pleasure of talking to:
- Shivam A., Staff ML Engineer at Meta

"54% of engineering leaders mentioned that they don’t monitor AI/LLM systems.

That tells me that a lot of effort is being put into adopting these new tools or implementing a set of new AI features.

But they don’t focus on ensuring that they are actually performant.

Which is quite alarming in my opinion, and can be quite detrimental for a company if they neglect the performance, as that’s very important for the users.

This has been an interesting insight from the Engineering Performance report done by LeadDev that I closely looked at.

"How to grow from Senior Engineer to a Lead role?

These are my top 5 tips that would help you with this:
1. Let your manager know about your goals and aspirations ASAP.
2. Become a credible engineer (build up your skills and focus on how others perceive you).
3. Become a team player and a great engineer to work with.
4. Become the go-to person or considered an expert in a certain engineering domain.
5. Become business and product-minded engineer.

I have taught 200+ students in detail about this exact topic in a cohort-based course called Senior Engineer to Lead: Grow and thrive in the role.

And now, the course is 25% off for a limited time, as it has been featured as part of the Fast Track selected courses by Maven.

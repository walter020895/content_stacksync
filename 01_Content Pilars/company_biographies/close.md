# THE SEVEN REJECTIONS: The Origin Story of Close

---

## I. THE HOOK: The CRM Nobody Meant to Build

San Francisco, 2012.

Steli Efti is running Elastic Sales, an outsourced sales team for venture-backed startups. His salespeople are crushing it—cold calls, demos, closes—helping Silicon Valley startups grow without hiring their own sales teams.

There's just one problem.

Every CRM on the market is garbage.

Salesforce is built for enterprise managers who want dashboards, not for salespeople who need to make calls. The data entry is endless. The workflow is clunky. Efti's team spends more time fighting their tools than selling.

"We didn't want to use any kind of traditional CRM or sales software that was out there," Efti later recalled.

Two of his co-founders are engineers. Within a month of starting Elastic Sales, they begin building their own internal tool. Just for them. Just to make the calls easier, the follow-ups faster, the data entry automatic.

They never intended to sell it.

Then something unexpected happens.

Elastic Sales' salespeople start showing the tool to other salespeople. Word spreads. Phone calls start coming in: "How do we buy this software?"

The side project becomes the main event.

In January 2013, they release Close.io—a CRM built by salespeople, for salespeople, with calling and emailing at its core.

The accidental product becomes a $50 million business.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The Immigrant Hustler

**From Greece to Silicon Valley**

Steli Efti didn't grow up in tech. He grew up in Greece, bootstrapping businesses the hard way—no connections, no playbook, no safety net.

He knew he wanted to build a technology company. But he had no experience, no background, and no idea where to start. What he did have was an unshakeable conviction: Silicon Valley was where he needed to be.

In 2006, Efti sold everything he owned and bought a one-way ticket to Mountain View, California.

He arrived with nothing but hustle.

**Seven Rejections**

Y Combinator—the legendary startup accelerator that produced Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox—became Efti's white whale.

He applied. Rejected.
Applied again. Rejected.
And again. And again.

Over five years, Efti was rejected by Y Combinator seven times. He built startups that failed. He spent years on projects that went nowhere. He watched other founders get the acceptance emails while his inbox stayed empty.

Most people would have quit. Efti kept applying.

**SwipeGood: The Acceptance**

In 2011, on his eighth attempt, Efti finally broke through. SwipeGood—a charitable giving platform—was accepted into Y Combinator's Winter 2011 batch.

The validation was real. The growth wasn't.

Eight months after launching SwipeGood, the company had flatlined. The metrics weren't moving. The vision wasn't connecting. Efti had finally made it into YC, and the startup was dying anyway.

But something he'd learned along the way was about to change everything.

## III. THE GRIND: Elastic Sales

**The Outsourced Sales Machine**

Efti was phenomenally good at one thing: selling.

Years of rejection had forged an unbreakable sales mentality. Cold calls didn't scare him. Objections didn't faze him. He had the relentless hustle that separated closers from dreamers.

When SwipeGood faded, Efti pivoted to what he knew best. He founded Elastic Sales—an outsourced sales team for venture-backed startups in Silicon Valley.

The model was simple: startups needed sales, but hiring salespeople was slow and risky. Elastic Sales provided instant, professional sales teams on demand.

The business worked. Clients came. Revenue grew.

**The Tool That Built Itself**

But running a sales operation exposed the industry's dirty secret: the tools were terrible.

CRMs were designed for sales *managers*—executives who wanted reports and forecasts. They weren't designed for sales *reps*—the people making calls, sending emails, doing the actual work.

Using Salesforce to make cold calls was like using a spreadsheet to write a novel. Technically possible. Practically miserable.

Efti's engineering co-founders started building an internal tool. Just for Elastic Sales. A CRM that put communication first—calling, emailing, tracking—with all the logging happening automatically.

No more data entry theater. No more switching between ten apps to do one job. Just sell.

**The Demand Nobody Expected**

Elastic Sales' team used the tool. Other salespeople saw it. The questions started:

"What is that?"
"Can we get access?"
"How much?"

Efti wasn't trying to build a SaaS company. But the market was telling him something. The demand was organic, unsolicited, urgent.

The internal tool wanted to be a product.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: Close.io

**January 2013: The Launch**

In January 2013, Efti and team released Close.io publicly—a CRM with calling and email at its core.

The differentiation was immediate:
- **Built-in calling**: Click a number, make a call, log it automatically
- **Built-in email**: Send emails from the CRM, track opens and replies
- **Automatic logging**: Stop doing data entry; let the software do it
- **Made for reps**: Designed for the people who actually sell, not their managers

Every feature was born from the frustrations of running Elastic Sales. Every workflow reflected what salespeople actually needed.

**The Content Machine**

Efti didn't just build a product. He built a brand.

He became "Silicon Valley's most prominent sales hustler"—writing blog posts, recording podcasts, giving talks. His content was raw, practical, and anti-bullshit. He taught sales techniques that actually worked, drawn from years of making calls and closing deals.

The content attracted the exact customers Close needed: sales-driven founders who valued hustle over process, action over administration.

**Bootstrapped and Remote**

Close never took venture capital. The company grew on revenue, not funding rounds.

They also went 100% remote before remote was cool—building a distributed team long before COVID made it mandatory.

The result was a lean, profitable, growing business that Efti actually controlled.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: The Anti-VC Success Story

**The Numbers**

Close grew from side project to serious business:
- 100% bootstrapped
- 125+ person team (all remote)
- Over $50 million in revenue
- Thousands of customers worldwide

No venture capital. No board meetings. No pressure to sell or IPO.

**Steli Efti Today**

Efti remains CEO and the company's public face. He continues writing and speaking about sales—not theory, but practice.

His story has become a touchstone for founders who don't fit the traditional Silicon Valley mold:
- Seven YC rejections before acceptance
- A failing startup pivoted into a service business
- An internal tool that became a product
- Bootstrapping when everyone else was raising

**The Lesson**

Close exists because Steli Efti wouldn't quit.

Not when Greece felt too small. Not when Y Combinator rejected him seven times. Not when SwipeGood flatlined. Not when building a CRM wasn't the plan.

The software that powers sales teams around the world was never supposed to be a product. It was supposed to make Efti's own salespeople more effective.

But when the market tells you something wants to exist, sometimes you listen.

And sometimes seven rejections are just the prologue.

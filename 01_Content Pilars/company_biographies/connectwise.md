# FROM PARENTS' HOUSE TO BILLION-DOLLAR EXIT: The Origin Story of ConnectWise

---

## I. THE HOOK: The Price Waterhouse Failure

Tampa, Florida. 1982.

Arnie Bellini has just experienced his first major career failure.

At Price Waterhouse—one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world—he'd built a practice focused on the newly emergent personal computer. He believed PCs would transform business. He convinced the firm to invest in this practice area.

It was, by his own account, "a miserable failure."

The networks of 1981 were primitive and unreliable. Clients weren't ready. Technology wasn't ready. Price Waterhouse decided to pull the plug.

Bellini could have accepted a different assignment within the firm. He was 26, with a University of Florida accounting degree (summa cum laude) and a USF MBA in Finance (also summa cum laude). He had options.

Instead, he did something bold: he convinced Price Waterhouse to let him take the seven clients he'd assembled and start his own shop.

With his brother David, Arnie Bellini founded ConnectWise IT—a managed IT services provider operating out of their parents' house in Tampa Bay.

Seven clients. No venture capital. No grand vision of software platforms or billion-dollar exits.

Just two brothers, their parents' house, and a belief that personal computers would eventually matter.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The Accidental Pioneer

**The Tampa Brothers**

Arnie and David Bellini grew up in Tampa. Arnie was the driven one—graduating summa cum laude from two programs, joining Price Waterhouse, pushing into emerging technology.

David was his partner, the complement to Arnie's ambition.

Neither imagined they were founding what would become a pioneering company in an industry that didn't yet exist.

**The MSP Before MSPs**

In 1982, "managed service provider" wasn't a category. The idea that companies would outsource their IT operations to external providers—paying monthly fees for ongoing support rather than hourly rates for break-fix work—hadn't been invented yet.

ConnectWise IT was, initially, just a technology consulting company. They helped small and medium-sized businesses in Tampa Bay with their computing needs. When something broke, they fixed it.

But over time, Bellini recognized a pattern: businesses didn't want to call for help when things broke. They wanted things not to break in the first place. They wanted someone to manage their technology proactively.

This insight—proactive management, ongoing relationships, monthly recurring revenue—would define the MSP industry that Bellini helped create.

## III. THE GRIND: Building Tools for Themselves

**The Internal Software**

Running an IT services company required tracking dozens of things: client hardware, software licenses, support tickets, billing hours, project schedules.

In 1987, the Bellini brothers started developing their own software to manage this chaos. The goal was simple: integrate the various programs they used for business into one unified system.

They weren't trying to build a software company. They were trying to run their services business more efficiently.

**The Platform Emerges**

Over the next decade, their internal tools grew more sophisticated. They tracked:
- Client inventory and configurations
- Support tickets and resolutions
- Project management and timelines
- Billing and invoicing
- Sales pipelines and customer relationships

By the late 1990s, they had built a comprehensive business management platform—designed by MSPs, for MSPs.

**1998: The Transformation**

In 1998, Bellini made a strategic decision: transform ConnectWise from a services company into a software company.

The internal tools they'd built to run their own MSP would become a product. Other managed service providers—struggling with the same operational chaos—could buy the ConnectWise platform and run their businesses the same way.

This was the pivot that changed everything.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: The MSP Platform

**The Market**

The timing was perfect. The managed services industry was emerging. Companies were increasingly dependent on technology but didn't want to build IT departments. They needed partners.

And those partners needed software to run their businesses.

**The Product: Professional Services Automation (PSA)**

ConnectWise became a leader in "professional services automation"—software that integrated everything an MSP needed:
- Ticketing and service desk
- Remote monitoring and management
- Project management
- Billing and invoicing
- CRM and sales tracking

The platform embodied Bellini's own experience running an MSP. Every feature existed because he'd needed it himself.

**The Community**

ConnectWise didn't just sell software—they built a community.

They hosted conferences where MSPs could learn from each other. They created partner programs. They became the center of an industry ecosystem.

This community building created loyalty that pure software companies couldn't match. ConnectWise wasn't just a vendor—they were part of the MSP identity.

**The Growth**

ConnectWise grew steadily through the 2000s and 2010s:
- Acquiring complementary companies
- Expanding their product suite
- Growing their customer base globally

By 2019, the company had:
- Over 1,200 employees
- $250 million in annual recurring revenue
- Thousands of MSP partners worldwide

## V. THE AFTERMATH: The $1.5 Billion Exit

**The Thoma Bravo Acquisition**

In 2019, private equity firm Thoma Bravo acquired ConnectWise for $1.5 billion.

The deal made history in Tampa Bay. The company that started in the Bellinis' parents' house had become the area's first billion-dollar valuation.

Even more remarkable: 74 ConnectWise employees became millionaires as a result of the sale. The wealth wasn't just concentrated at the top—it spread through the company.

**The Impact on Tampa**

The ConnectWise exit helped establish Tampa Bay as a legitimate technology hub. The success proved that billion-dollar tech companies could be built in Florida, not just Silicon Valley.

Former ConnectWise employees went on to start their own companies, invest in local startups, and mentor the next generation of Tampa entrepreneurs.

**Arnie Bellini Today**

Bellini stepped back from ConnectWise after the acquisition. He now runs Bellini Capital, investing in and mentoring companies—particularly in the Tampa Bay area.

His legacy includes not just ConnectWise but the entire MSP industry. He's credited as one of the original founders and visionaries responsible for the rise of managed service providers.

**The Lesson**

ConnectWise's founding story is about the long game.

Bellini didn't start with a vision for a billion-dollar software company. He started with seven clients and his brother, working out of their parents' house.

For fifteen years, they ran an IT services company. They built software to solve their own problems. They figured out what MSPs actually needed by being MSPs themselves.

When they finally pivoted to software in 1998, they had something competitors couldn't match: deep, firsthand understanding of their customers' world.

Sometimes the best way to build a platform is to live the pain for years before trying to solve it.

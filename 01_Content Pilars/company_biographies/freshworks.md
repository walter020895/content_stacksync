# THE ZENDESK KILLER: The Origin Story of Freshworks

## I. THE HOOK: The Hacker News Comment That Built an Empire

Chennai, India. 2010.

Girish Mathrubootham is scrolling through Hacker News at his desk when a post catches his eye: Zendesk is raising its prices. Again.

He clicks through to the comments. The thread is a river of frustration—customers furious at being squeezed, small businesses feeling betrayed, the typical startup-becomes-corporate price hike rage.

One comment stops him cold:

*"It just shows how someone could come up with the right product at the right price and take all of Zendesk's customers away."*

Mathrubootham reads it again. His entrepreneurial brain sees gold.

He's been at Zoho Corporation for nine years—technical roles, product roles, sales roles. He knows SaaS. He knows customer service software. And he knows, viscerally, how bad customer support can be. Just months earlier, while moving from Austin back to Chennai, he'd had to pay $500 to replace a damaged television because the customer service process was a disaster.

The frustration in that Hacker News thread isn't abstract to him. It's personal.

What if he built the alternative? What if he took on the company that every startup used for customer support? What if David challenged Goliath?

He picks up his phone and calls Shan Krishnasamy, a technical architect he knows from Zoho.

"I have an idea," he says.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: Nine Years at Zoho

**The Path to Chennai**

Girish Mathrubootham didn't start in tech. His path wound through various careers before a cousin's friend working at Zoho Corporation helped him land a job at the Chennai-based software company.

From 2001 to 2010, Mathrubootham immersed himself in the SaaS business. Technical positions. Product management. Sales. He saw every angle of how software companies actually worked.

More importantly, he saw how Zoho built products for global markets from India—proving that Chennai could compete with Silicon Valley.

**The $500 TV**

The catalyst wasn't just business opportunity. It was personal rage.

While moving from Austin, Texas, to Chennai, Mathrubootham had a television damaged in shipping. The customer service experience was a nightmare—endless phone trees, unhelpful agents, a process that seemed designed to frustrate rather than resolve. In the end, he paid $500 out of pocket to replace the TV because fighting the system wasn't worth the agony.

He never forgot that experience. Customer support was broken. The tools companies used to provide support were part of the problem.

**Shan Krishnasamy**

At Zoho, Mathrubootham had worked alongside Shan Krishnasamy, a brilliant technical architect. When the Hacker News moment struck, Krishnasamy was the first call.

The two began planning nights and weekends—but with families and kids, moonlighting wasn't sustainable. In October 2010, both resigned from Zoho.

They found a 700-square-foot warehouse in Chennai. They assembled a team of six people. And they started building.

## III. THE GRIND: The Warehouse in Chennai

**Freshdesk is Born**

The first product was Freshdesk—a cloud-based customer support platform that did everything Zendesk did, but simpler and cheaper.

The timing was perfect. Zendesk's price increases had created a wave of disgruntled customers actively looking for alternatives. Mathrubootham and team worked feverishly to build something they could put in front of those customers before they found other solutions.

**The David vs. Goliath Moment**

When Freshdesk launched, Mathrubootham didn't just compete quietly. He went on the attack.

He tweeted about Zendesk's pricing changes. He offered to match remaining Zendesk contracts for free—essentially paying customers to switch. He positioned Freshdesk explicitly as the alternative for businesses who felt betrayed.

Then Mikkel Svane, Zendesk's CEO, made a mistake.

Svane publicly criticized Freshdesk, accusing the company of copying Zendesk's model. It was meant to dismiss the upstart. It backfired spectacularly.

**The Blog Post That Changed Everything**

Instead of getting defensive, Mathrubootham wrote a detailed, transparent blog post defending Freshdesk's originality. He acknowledged the inspiration but detailed the genuine innovation. He was humble where appropriate and fierce where necessary.

The "David vs. Goliath" narrative exploded. Tech media picked up the story. Developers who resented incumbent arrogance cheered for the Chennai underdog.

"That tweet from Zendesk's CEO gave us more visibility than we could've ever bought," Mathrubootham later said.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: Beyond Customer Support

**The Platform Expansion**

Freshdesk proved the model. But Mathrubootham saw a bigger opportunity: businesses needed more than just helpdesk software.

Freshworks (as the company rebranded) expanded into:
- **Freshsales**: CRM and sales automation
- **Freshservice**: IT service management
- **Freshchat**: Customer messaging
- **Freshmarketer**: Marketing automation

The vision crystallized: a complete suite of business software, built for modern companies, priced for accessibility.

**The Funding Rounds**

Unlike Zoho, Freshworks did take venture capital—but on strong terms that let Mathrubootham maintain control. The funding accelerated growth:
- 2014: $31 million Series C
- 2015: $50 million Series D
- 2016: $55 million Series E
- 2018: $100 million Series F
- 2019: $150 million Series G

By 2019, Freshworks was valued at over $3.5 billion.

**Chennai to Global**

Throughout the growth, Freshworks stayed rooted in Chennai. The company proved—again—that world-class software could be built from India.

But they also expanded globally: offices in the U.S., Europe, Australia. The customer base grew to over 50,000 companies across 120 countries.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: India's First SaaS IPO on NASDAQ

**September 22, 2021**

On September 22, 2021, Freshworks went public on NASDAQ—the first Indian SaaS company to list on the American exchange.

The IPO priced at $36 per share. On opening day, the stock soared, valuing the company at close to $13 billion. Mathrubootham rang the opening bell from his office in Chennai.

**500 Millionaires**

The most remarkable part wasn't the valuation. It was what Mathrubootham did with it.

He had awarded stock to approximately three-quarters of his 4,300 employees over the years. When the IPO hit, about 500 employees—many of them engineers in India—became millionaires.

The total value distributed to employees: $4.5 billion.

**The Legacy**

Freshworks proved several things that seemed uncertain in 2010:

1. An Indian SaaS company could go public on NASDAQ
2. You could challenge entrenched players by serving frustrated customers better
3. Chennai could build products that compete with San Francisco
4. You could make hundreds of employees wealthy, not just founders

**Where They Are Now**

Today, Freshworks serves over 60,000 companies worldwide. The product suite continues expanding. The Chennai warehouse is long gone, replaced by global offices.

And somewhere in a Hacker News comment section, that anonymous commenter who said "someone could come up with the right product at the right price and take all of Zendesk's customers away" turned out to be exactly right.

Girish Mathrubootham saw the comment. And he did it.

# THE REVENGE: The Origin Story of Workday

## I. THE HOOK: The Hostile Takeover

January 2005.

David Duffield is 64 years old. He should be retired. He *was* retired—briefly—until Oracle came for PeopleSoft.

For eighteen months, Larry Ellison has been waging the most aggressive hostile takeover in enterprise software history. PeopleSoft, the company Duffield built from nothing, the company he ran for nearly two decades, the company that made him a billionaire—Oracle wants to absorb it. Destroy it. Strip it for parts.

Duffield has come out of retirement to fight. He and his lieutenants have worked like crazy, deploying every legal and strategic defense they can imagine. Poison pills. Customer retention programs. Public campaigns questioning Oracle's intentions.

It doesn't matter. The shareholders vote. Oracle wins. The deal closes for $10.7 billion.

On the day the acquisition is finalized, Duffield is out. His company—the second-largest application software company in the world—belongs to Oracle now.

Most people would accept defeat. Take the money. Sail off into the sunset.

Duffield calls Aneel Bhusri, his former chief strategist, and asks him to meet for breakfast.

He's not done yet.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The Man Who Built PeopleSoft

**Cleveland to Cornell**

David Duffield was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. His mother Mary was an elementary school teacher. His father Al was an engineer without a college degree—a self-made man who instilled in his son the belief that hard work could overcome any obstacle.

At Cornell University, Duffield was a Renaissance man: electrical engineering major, pitcher on the baseball team, member of a band. He earned his bachelor's in engineering and stayed for an MBA, emerging with both technical depth and business instincts.

**The PeopleSoft Empire**

In 1987, at 46 years old, Duffield founded PeopleSoft. The timing was bold—he was already past the age when most entrepreneurs start their first company.

The premise was simple but revolutionary: human resources software that was actually usable. The enterprise HR systems of the era were mainframe monstrosities. PeopleSoft would bring client-server architecture and intuitive interfaces to a market dominated by IBM and Oracle.

By the early 2000s, PeopleSoft had grown into the world's second-largest application software company. Tens of thousands of employees. Billions in revenue. A loyal customer base that loved the company's culture of customer service.

Then Larry Ellison decided he wanted it.

**Maddie: The Lighthouse**

To understand Duffield, you have to understand Maddie.

In the early years of PeopleSoft—the years when Duffield was breaking away from his previous company, fighting to establish something new, struggling through the inevitable startup chaos—a Miniature Schnauzer named Maddie was his constant companion.

"Maddie was the lighthouse during the stormy period," Duffield later said.

Duffield and his wife Cheryl made a promise: if they ever became wealthy, their top priority would be giving back to Maddie and her kind. When Maddie passed away in 1997, the Duffields made good on that promise, establishing Maddie's Fund with an initial investment of $200 million—the largest animal welfare foundation in history.

This was who Duffield was: a builder, but also a giver. A competitor, but also someone who kept his promises.

## III. THE GRIND: Starting Over at 65

**The Breakfast at Truckee Diner**

Shortly after the Oracle takeover closed, Duffield and Aneel Bhusri met for breakfast at the Truckee Diner near Lake Tahoe.

Bhusri was 38 years old, a former PeopleSoft vice chair and head of product strategy. He'd been at Greylock Partners, one of Silicon Valley's top venture firms, when the Oracle drama unfolded. He'd watched his mentor's company get swallowed whole.

Over breakfast, the two men asked themselves a question: *What if we started again?*

Not PeopleSoft 2.0—the market had changed. The cloud was emerging. Salesforce was proving that enterprise software could live on the internet. What if they took everything they'd learned building PeopleSoft and rebuilt it from scratch, designed from day one for the cloud?

"We had all the ingredients for a potential success," Duffield said. "The market was springing up. We had the technology. We had the cream-of-the-crop talent. We had a good reputation right out of the gate. We felt we would be foolish not to try."

By March 2005—just two months after the Oracle acquisition closed—Workday was incorporated.

**$15 Million of His Own Money**

Duffield, now 65 years old, wrote a check: $15 million of his own money to fund the seed round.

This wasn't a typical startup. Duffield didn't need to pitch VCs. He didn't need to prove himself. He was a billionaire with a track record and a grudge.

But more importantly, he had access to something money couldn't easily buy: talent. Former PeopleSoft employees, many of them disgusted by the Oracle acquisition, were eager to join. The "cream-of-the-crop," as Duffield called them, came out of the woodwork.

**The Cloud Bet**

The strategic insight was clear: enterprise software was moving to the cloud, and the legacy players weren't positioned to follow.

Oracle, SAP, the traditional vendors—they had billions of dollars invested in on-premise software. Their business models depended on perpetual licenses and maintenance fees. Moving to the cloud would cannibalize their existing revenue streams.

Workday would have no such constraints. They would build everything for the cloud from the start. No legacy code. No licensing baggage. Pure SaaS.

Human capital management and financial management—the heart of every large organization—would live in the cloud.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: Proving the Skeptics Wrong

**The Enterprise Bet**

The conventional wisdom said enterprise software couldn't work in the cloud. HR systems contained the most sensitive employee data—salaries, social security numbers, performance reviews. Financial systems were even more critical. No Fortune 500 company would trust this to servers they didn't control.

Workday bet otherwise.

The cloud wasn't just a deployment model—it was an architectural advantage. Updates could roll out continuously. Customers would always have the latest version. There was no more "upgrade cycle" hell, no more eighteen-month implementation projects.

For CIOs exhausted by Oracle's complexity, it was a revelation.

**The Customers**

The early customers were skeptics who became converts. Companies that had sworn they'd never trust their HR data to the cloud tried Workday... and didn't look back.

By the time of the IPO, Workday had marquee customers across industries. The reputation that Duffield and Bhusri had built at PeopleSoft—the reputation for actually caring about customer success—transferred to the new company.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: The Second Billion-Dollar Exit

**The IPO**

On October 12, 2012, Workday went public on the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO priced at $28 per share, valuing the company at over $9 billion.

Dave Duffield, who was 71 years old, had built his second multi-billion-dollar company. He had also structured Workday to ensure what happened to PeopleSoft could never happen again.

**The Takeover Defense**

Duffield and Bhusri hold voting rights to shares that collectively represent 67% of the company's voting power. This dual-class stock structure makes a hostile takeover virtually impossible.

Oracle took PeopleSoft because shareholders voted for short-term profit. At Workday, Duffield and Bhusri maintain control. No hostile bidder can force a sale.

It's the ultimate revenge: building something even better, and making sure no one can take it away.

**The Numbers**

Today, Workday generates over $7 billion in annual revenue. The company serves more than 10,000 organizations worldwide. The cloud bet that seemed risky in 2005 became the obvious future.

**The Legacy**

Dave Duffield proved several things with Workday:

1. You can build a world-class company at any age
2. The cloud was the future of enterprise software
3. If you lose your first company to a hostile takeover, you can always build a better one
4. And then you can structure it so they can never take it again

At 83, Duffield remains on Workday's board. The Maddie's Fund has given over $300 million to animal welfare. The Duffields have donated more to saving dogs and cats than any other individuals in history.

The lighthouse that guided him through the stormy years of PeopleSoft's founding now guides a nationwide movement.

And the hostile takeover that was supposed to end his career? It just opened a door.

# THE FIVE ENGINEERS WHO BUILT EUROPE'S SOFTWARE EMPIRE: The Origin Story of SAP

## I. THE HOOK: The Cancelled Project

Mannheim, Germany. 1971.

Five IBM engineers stare at a memo that will change their lives.

The project they've been building—an enterprise-wide system for Xerox, something that would integrate business processes across an entire company—has been cancelled. Their work is no longer needed.

Dietmar Hopp, Hasso Plattner, Klaus Tschira, Hans-Werner Hector, and Claus Wellenreuther have spent months on this vision. They've seen what's possible: software that could run an entire business, connecting every department, every process, every decision into one unified system.

IBM says stop. The market isn't ready. The approach is too ambitious.

The five engineers look at each other. They have two choices: accept new assignments within IBM, or bet their careers on an idea their employer just rejected.

On April 1, 1972, they choose to bet.

They walk away from the security of IBM—one of the most prestigious employers in the world—and start a company in Weinheim, Germany. They call it "Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung"—Systems Analysis and Program Development.

They call it SAP.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The IBM Connection

**Germany in the 1970s**

Germany in the early 1970s was rebuilding. The post-war economic miracle—the "Wirtschaftswunder"—had transformed the country into an industrial powerhouse. German engineering was synonymous with precision and reliability.

But in software, Germany trailed America. IBM dominated the computing landscape. German businesses ran on IBM mainframes, programmed by IBM consultants, maintained by IBM support teams.

For ambitious German engineers, IBM was the place to be. The technology was cutting-edge. The training was world-class. The career path was stable.

**The Five Engineers**

The five founders were all IBM employees based in the Mannheim area:

**Dietmar Hopp** would become the business driver—focused on customers, markets, and growth.

**Hasso Plattner** was the technical visionary—restless, demanding, always pushing for what was next.

**Klaus Tschira** brought mathematical rigor and a passion for science.

**Hans-Werner Hector** was the practical implementer—turning ideas into working systems.

**Claus Wellenreuther** rounded out the team as an experienced systems developer.

They'd worked together at IBM on the Xerox project. They'd seen firsthand what enterprise software could become.

**The Xerox Vision**

The project IBM cancelled wasn't just software—it was a philosophy.

Traditional business software was fragmented. Accounting ran on one system. Inventory on another. Sales on a third. Data had to be manually reconciled. Decisions were made on incomplete information.

The Xerox project envisioned something different: a unified system where all business data lived together. Where a sale automatically updated inventory, triggered manufacturing, and flowed through to accounting. Where managers could see the whole business in real time.

IBM thought this was premature. The five engineers thought it was inevitable.

## III. THE GRIND: Borrowed Computers and First Customers

**April 1, 1972: The Beginning**

SAP started as a private partnership under German law. The founders set up headquarters in Weinheim, with an office in Mannheim.

But they spent most of their time somewhere else: at the data center of their first customer, the German subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

SAP had no computers of its own. In 1972, mainframes cost millions. So the founders did what startups do—they borrowed. They used ICI's computers at night and on weekends, when the machines weren't running production workloads.

"It was a weekend and evening project," one account described. The founders kept their families fed while building software on borrowed equipment during borrowed time.

**The First Product: RF**

Their first product was a financial accounting system called RF (for "Rechnungswesen-Finanzen"). It did what the cancelled IBM project had envisioned: processed business data in real time and provided immediate feedback.

This was radical. Most business software of the era worked in batch mode—you'd enter data during the day, run processing overnight, and see results the next morning. SAP's real-time approach meant managers could see information immediately.

**The German Market**

SAP's early customers were German industrial companies—the manufacturing giants that powered the economy. These weren't flashy technology firms. They were practical, demanding, and deeply skeptical of anything that didn't work perfectly.

This customer base shaped SAP's DNA. The software had to be reliable. It had to handle complexity. It had to work in the real world of factories, supply chains, and accounting departments.

**Growth in the 1970s**

By 1980, SAP had grown to about 80 employees. They moved into their first owned office building—in Walldorf, Germany, where SAP remains headquartered today.

The company was profitable. The software was proven. The founders had validated their bet.

But they were still a regional German company. The global empire was yet to come.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: R/2 and R/3

**R/2: The Mainframe Era**

In the late 1970s, SAP released R/2—a complete rewrite of their software for IBM mainframes. The "R" stood for "real-time processing."

R/2 was a fully integrated enterprise system:
- Financial accounting
- Materials management
- Production planning
- Sales and distribution

Everything connected. Data flowed automatically between modules. The vision from the cancelled Xerox project was now reality.

R/2 dominated the German market and began expanding internationally. Large enterprises—the kind that could afford IBM mainframes—adopted SAP as their standard.

**R/3: The Client-Server Revolution**

The 1990s brought a technological shift: client-server computing. Instead of centralized mainframes, businesses were adopting networks of smaller computers.

SAP recognized the shift and bet the company on it.

In 1992, they released R/3—a complete redesign of their software for the client-server world. R/3 could run on Unix, Windows, and other platforms. It wasn't locked to IBM mainframes.

This was risky. R/2 was a cash cow. Many customers weren't ready to migrate. But Plattner and the team believed client-server was the future, and they'd rather cannibalize themselves than let competitors do it.

R/3 exploded. Companies worldwide adopted it. SAP went from a German enterprise software company to a global juggernaut.

**The IPO**

SAP went public in 1988, listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The IPO valued the company at hundreds of millions of deutsche marks—remarkable for a software company that had started in borrowed office space.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: The World's Largest ERP Vendor

**The Enterprise Standard**

By the late 1990s, SAP had become synonymous with enterprise software. "Implementing SAP" was a multi-year, multi-million-dollar undertaking for large companies—a rite of passage for corporations joining the global economy.

The Big Five consulting firms built entire practices around SAP implementations. A cottage industry of consultants, integrators, and trainers emerged.

**The Scale Today**

SAP SE is now:
- The world's largest vendor of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software
- Headquartered in Walldorf, Germany (population: ~15,000)
- Serving 440,000+ customers in 190+ countries
- One of the most valuable companies in Europe

**The Founders' Legacy**

Of the five founders:
- **Dietmar Hopp** became a billionaire philanthropist, funding sports, science, and his beloved TSG 1899 Hoffenheim football club
- **Hasso Plattner** remained the technical visionary, driving SAP's move to cloud computing and in-memory databases (SAP HANA)
- **Klaus Tschira** devoted himself to scientific education through his foundation before his death in 2015
- **Hans-Werner Hector** stepped back from operations but remained a shareholder
- **Claus Wellenreuther** left the company early but contributed to its foundational technology

**The Lesson**

SAP's founding story contains a truth that every corporate employee should remember: sometimes the project your company cancels is exactly what the world needs.

Five engineers at IBM saw a vision for enterprise software. Their employer said no. They said yes.

From borrowed computers in a customer's data center, they built the foundation of modern enterprise software. From a small German town called Walldorf, they created a company that runs the back offices of the world's largest corporations.

The project IBM cancelled became a $200 billion company.

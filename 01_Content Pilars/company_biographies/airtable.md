# THE SPREADSHEET THAT SHOULD HAVE EXISTED: The Origin Story of Airtable

---

## I. THE HOOK: The 90% Insight

San Francisco. 2012.

Howie Liu is 22 years old. He's just sold his first startup, Etacts, to Salesforce. He's supposed to be grateful—and he is. But he's also restless. The corporate machine doesn't fit him. After one year at Salesforce, he's already plotting his escape.

But before he leaves, he notices something that won't let him go.

People are using spreadsheets *wrong*.

Or rather, they're using spreadsheets in ways they were never designed for. Customer lists. Project trackers. Event planning. Content calendars. Inventories. The entire organizational infrastructure of modern business, crammed into rows and columns meant for numbers.

Liu digs into the data: *Almost 90% of spreadsheets don't have formulas.*

The tool designed for numerical analysis and financial calculations is being used as a glorified database. People are bending Excel and Google Sheets into something they were never meant to be—and suffering for it.

"Spreadsheets are really optimized for numerical analysis and financial calculations," Liu realizes. "But most are used for organizing purposes."

What if someone built the tool that spreadsheet users actually need?

What if you took the flexibility people love about spreadsheets and gave it the power of a real database?

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The 21-Year-Old Who Sold to Salesforce

**The First Exit**

Howie Liu wasn't a typical first-time founder. At 21, he'd already built and sold Etacts—a contact management tool that caught Salesforce's attention.

The acquisition should have been a launching pad for a corporate career. Instead, it became an education.

At Salesforce, Liu had a front-row seat to how enterprises organized their data. Salesforce's flexible data model—the ability to create custom objects, define relationships, build complex information architectures—was powerful. But it required developers. It required implementation consultants. It required months of configuration.

Meanwhile, out in the wild, millions of knowledge workers were doing the same thing with spreadsheets. Badly. Heroically. Desperately.

They didn't want to wait for IT. They didn't want to learn SQL. They wanted to organize their world *now*, with tools they could control.

Liu saw the gap. Spreadsheets were too dumb. Databases were too hard. Someone needed to build what lived in between.

**The Co-Founders**

In January 2013, Liu left Salesforce and recruited two co-founders:

**Andrew Ofstad**: A designer with an obsession for user experience. If this spreadsheet-database hybrid was going to work, it needed to *feel* right. Ofstad would make sure it did.

**Emmett Nicholas**: The technical architect. Building a product that was as flexible as a spreadsheet but as powerful as a relational database was an engineering challenge. Nicholas would solve it.

The three of them set out to build something nobody had built before: a spreadsheet that actually worked like a database.

## III. THE GRIND: Two Years in Stealth

**The Ashton Kutcher Meeting**

Airtable was officially founded in 2012, but the company spent most of that year in user research. Liu wanted to understand exactly how people were abusing spreadsheets—what they were trying to accomplish, where the friction was, what they wished they could do.

When it came time to raise a seed round, Liu reached out to a familiar investor: Ashton Kutcher, who had backed Etacts.

The meeting happened in Los Angeles, on the set of *Two and a Half Men*. Liu and his team demonstrated the Airtable prototype—a grid that looked like a spreadsheet but understood relationships between records, could display data in different views, and didn't break when you tried to organize complex information.

Kutcher invested on the spot.

Freestyle Capital and the Box Group joined the round, bringing the total to $3 million.

**The Stealth Years (2012-2014)**

Most startups launch fast and iterate in public. Airtable did the opposite.

For nearly two years, the team worked in stealth mode. No public launch. No marketing. Just building.

The challenge was immense: create something that felt as intuitive as a spreadsheet but could handle:
- Linked records (like a database)
- Multiple views of the same data (grid, kanban, calendar, gallery)
- Rich field types (attachments, checkboxes, links, dropdowns)
- Real collaboration (multiple people editing at once)

Each feature had to feel obvious. If users had to read documentation to use Airtable, the product had failed.

**The Beta Launch (2014)**

In 2014, Airtable finally emerged from stealth with an invite-only beta. The product was far from complete, but it was usable—and users immediately understood it.

The spreadsheet-database hybrid worked. You could click into a cell and see it expand into a full record with linked data. You could switch from a grid view to a kanban board with one click. You could build complex organizational systems without writing a line of code.

The people who'd been wrestling with spreadsheets for years suddenly had a tool that *got* them.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: The No-Code Revolution

**The Power of Views**

Airtable's killer insight wasn't just the database backend—it was the *views*.

In a traditional database, data exists in tables. If you want to see that data differently, you write a query. Most people can't write queries.

In Airtable, the same data can be viewed as:
- A grid (the familiar spreadsheet)
- A kanban board (for workflow management)
- A calendar (for date-based data)
- A gallery (for visual content)

Switch views with a click. The data stays the same; the visualization changes. Suddenly, project managers could build tools that product managers could read. Marketing teams could organize campaigns in ways that made sense to *them*.

**The No-Code Moment**

Airtable launched at exactly the right moment. The "no-code" movement was emerging—a belief that business users shouldn't need developers to build the tools they need.

Airtable became a cornerstone of this movement. Users built:
- CRM systems
- Inventory management
- Content calendars
- Application tracking systems
- Event planning tools
- Basically everything

Each use case was something that traditionally required custom software or expensive enterprise tools. Now, anyone could build it in an afternoon.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: From Stealth to $11 Billion

**The Funding Explosion**

The rounds got bigger:
- **2015**: $7.6 million Series A
- **2018**: $52 million Series B (led by Coatue)
- **2018**: $100 million Series C (led by Thrive Capital)
- **2020**: $185 million Series D ($2.5 billion valuation)
- **2021**: $270 million Series E
- **2021**: $735 million Series F at $11 billion valuation

Airtable went from a stealth-mode startup to one of the most valuable private software companies in the world.

**The Competition**

Notion, Coda, and others emerged to compete in the "spreadsheet-plus" space. But Airtable had first-mover advantage and deep integrations with enterprise tools. The company had become infrastructure—the connective tissue between apps, teams, and workflows.

**The Enterprise Play**

As Airtable grew, it moved upmarket. Fortune 500 companies began using it not just for side projects but for mission-critical workflows. The flexibility that made it perfect for scrappy teams also made it adaptable to enterprise complexity.

**Where Airtable Is Now**

Today, Airtable powers over 450,000 organizations, from two-person startups to some of the world's largest enterprises. The product has expanded to include automations, app building, and integrations with hundreds of other tools.

Howie Liu, the 21-year-old who noticed that 90% of spreadsheets didn't have formulas, built the tool that all those spreadsheet abusers were actually looking for.

Sometimes the biggest opportunities are hiding in the gap between what tools are designed for and how people actually use them.

# THE COMEBACK: The Origin Story of ServiceNow

## I. THE HOOK: Everything Gone Overnight

San Diego, California. 2003.

Fred Luddy stares at his portfolio statement. Where there was once $35 million, there is now nothing. Worthless paper. Shares in a company that no longer exists.

Peregrine Systems—the company where Luddy served as CTO for thirteen years, the company that made him wealthy, the company that built some of the first IT service management software—has collapsed. Not from market forces. Not from competition. From fraud.

The SEC found Peregrine guilty of massive accounting fraud. Top executives are going to prison. The company has declared bankruptcy. Luddy's fortune, built over a decade and a half of work, has evaporated.

"I lost everything overnight," Luddy would later say.

He's 49 years old. He's broke. He's spent his entire career in IT service management—a field now tainted by the scandal.

When he left Peregrine, Luddy swore he would "never, ever, ever go back into the IT service management area."

His definition of "never" turns out to be about nine months.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The CTO's Career

**The Early Years**

Fred Luddy didn't take a traditional path to tech. He was largely self-taught, driven by curiosity and obsession rather than credentials.

His career wound through various technology companies before landing at Peregrine Systems in 1990. He became CTO—the technical architect of some of the first IT service management (ITSM) software.

**Peregrine Systems and the ITSM Market**

In the 1990s and early 2000s, IT service management was a growing but fragmented market. Companies needed software to track IT assets, manage help desk tickets, and handle service requests. Peregrine, along with competitors like Remedy (which Peregrine later acquired), built the tools that enterprise IT departments ran on.

Luddy understood this market intimately. He knew what worked and what didn't. He knew the pain points of every IT manager who had to maintain these systems.

He also knew that the existing software—including the software he'd helped build—was overly complex, expensive, and painful to deploy.

**The Fraud and the Fall**

In 2002, everything collapsed. Peregrine's executives had been cooking the books—inflating revenues, deceiving investors, lying to regulators. When the fraud came to light, the company's stock became worthless. Executives went to prison. Luddy's entire net worth vanished.

At nearly 50 years old, Luddy had two choices: give up or start over.

## III. THE GRIND: Glidesoft in 2004

**The Definition of Never**

Luddy took some time to recover. He considered other opportunities. But the more he thought about it, the more he realized he knew only one thing deeply: IT service management.

The industry he'd sworn to leave was the only industry where he could build something transformational.

And this time, he would do it differently.

"Even though when I left Peregrine, I swore that I would never, ever, ever go back into the IT service management area," Luddy said, "it turns out that my definition of never was about nine months."

**The Cloud Vision**

In 2004, just two weeks before his 50th birthday, Luddy founded a company called Glidesoft. The insight was simple but ahead of its time: IT service management belonged in the cloud.

The existing ITSM tools—including the ones Luddy had helped build—were on-premise nightmares. They required months of implementation, armies of consultants, and constant maintenance. Every upgrade was a major project.

What if the software just... ran? What if there were no servers to manage, no upgrades to schedule, no infrastructure to maintain? What if IT service management was delivered as a service?

This was 2004. Salesforce had pioneered SaaS for sales teams, but the enterprise IT market was deeply skeptical. The idea that mission-critical IT operations could run on someone else's servers seemed reckless.

Luddy bet otherwise.

**The Solo Years**

From 2004 to mid-2005, Luddy was the only employee. He wrote code. He built the product. He was the company.

In mid-2005, JMI Equity invested $2.5 million—enough to hire five additional people. The company that would become ServiceNow was finally more than a one-man show.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: Simplifying IT

**The Single System of Record**

Glidesoft (soon renamed ServiceNow) launched with a radical promise: a single cloud-based platform for IT operations.

Instead of cobbling together different tools for help desk, asset management, change management, and incident response, ServiceNow offered one system. Everything connected. Everything visible. Everything running in the cloud.

For IT managers exhausted by tool sprawl and infrastructure headaches, the pitch was irresistible.

**The Adoption Curve**

Enterprise IT departments are notoriously conservative. But ServiceNow found early adopters who were willing to bet on the cloud. Once they experienced the simplicity—no servers, automatic upgrades, rapid deployment—they became evangelists.

The product spread through enterprise IT communities by word of mouth. A CIO would try it, love it, and tell their peers.

**Frank Slootman and the Growth Phase**

In 2011, Luddy stepped aside as CEO and brought in Frank Slootman—a legendary enterprise software executive who would later lead Snowflake. Under Slootman, ServiceNow accelerated its growth, expanding beyond ITSM into HR service delivery, customer service, and security operations.

The single cloud platform that Luddy envisioned became the foundation for enterprise workflow automation.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: From Bankruptcy to $150 Billion

**The IPO**

On June 29, 2012, ServiceNow went public on the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO valued the company at over $2 billion.

The 50-year-old who had lost everything in 2003 had built a company worth billions in less than a decade.

**The Market Cap**

As of 2024, ServiceNow has a market capitalization exceeding $150 billion. The cloud-based ITSM platform that Luddy conceived in his darkest moment has become one of the most valuable enterprise software companies in the world.

**Fred Luddy Today**

Luddy served as CEO from 2004 to 2011, then focused on product development before moving to an advisory role. He remains on the board, watching the company he founded continue to grow.

His original goal—"using technology to simplify work experiences for regular people"—remains ServiceNow's north star.

**The Lessons**

Fred Luddy's story offers a brutal and inspiring lesson:

When everything collapses, you have a choice. You can accept defeat. Or you can use the wreckage as a foundation.

At 49, Luddy lost his fortune to someone else's fraud. At 50, he started building again. At 58, he was a billionaire.

The industry he swore never to return to made him one of the most successful tech founders of his generation.

Sometimes "never" just means "not yet."

# THE SEVEN-YEAR PLAN: The Origin Story of Chargebee

---

## I. THE HOOK: The Document from 2004

Chennai, India. 2004.

Krish Subramanian opens an email from his college friend Rajaraman Santhanam. Inside is a document—not a pitch deck, not a product spec, but a personal finance plan.

The document begins with an unusual instruction: "Save between 20% and 30% of your salary each month."

This isn't about getting rich. It's about getting free.

Subramanian and Santhanam have been talking about starting a company since their college days. But they know the reality: in India in 2004, there's no venture capital waiting to fund two engineers with an idea. If they're going to build something, they'll have to bootstrap it themselves.

So they start saving. Every rupee. Every paycheck. For years.

While their friends buy cars and apartments, they live frugally. They're building a war chest for a company that doesn't exist yet, for a product they haven't invented, for a market they haven't identified.

Seven years later, in a small apartment in Chennai, Chargebee is born.

The frugality wasn't sacrifice. It was strategy.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: Four Friends from Chennai

**The College Connection**

Krish Subramanian and Rajaraman Santhanam met as engineering students. They stayed in touch through the years, both working in tech, both harboring the same dream: build something of their own.

The 2004 document crystallized that dream into action—but patient action. They would save. They would learn. They would wait for the right moment.

**The Zoho Connection**

Rajaraman's roommate was Thiyagarajan T ("Thiyagu"), an engineer who had worked at Zoho—Chennai's legendary SaaS company, the bootstrapped empire that proved world-class software could be built from India.

Thiyagu was on sabbatical, restless, looking for something new. He started hacking on ideas with Rajaraman. The energy was building.

**Saravanan KP: The Mentor Who Became a Founder**

Saravanan KP ("KPS") was a respected figure at Zoho—a mentor to both Rajaraman and Thiyagu. When he heard his mentees were leaving to start something, he tried to convince them to stay.

The pitch didn't work. But something else happened: KPS became so intrigued by their vision that he left Zoho himself and joined as the fourth co-founder.

Four friends. All from Chennai. All betting on each other.

## III. THE GRIND: The Apartment in Chennai

**May 2011: The Leap**

In May 2011, Krish and Rajaraman quit their jobs. They joined Thiyagu, who had already been building. KPS followed.

The office was a small apartment in Chennai. The funding was their own savings—that war chest they'd been building since 2004. No venture capital. No safety net.

**The Problem: Everyone Needs to Get Paid**

The founders debated what to build. The answer emerged from first principles: "Everyone needs to get paid."

The subscription economy was exploding. SaaS companies, streaming services, membership businesses—all were moving to recurring revenue models. But billing was a nightmare.

Managing subscription billing meant:
- Handling multiple pricing plans
- Managing upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations
- Dealing with failed payments and retries
- Calculating taxes across jurisdictions
- Generating invoices and reports
- Integrating with payment gateways

Enterprise companies built custom billing systems. Startups cobbled together spreadsheets and Stripe webhooks. Neither worked well.

**The Vision**

Chargebee would be the billing infrastructure for the subscription economy. A plug-and-play platform that handled every aspect of recurring revenue—so businesses could focus on their products instead of their invoices.

**Early Customers**

The first customers were other SaaS startups—companies just like them, growing fast, struggling with billing complexity. Each customer taught them something new about edge cases, integrations, and what businesses actually needed.

The product evolved through customer conversations. The four founders were engineers, but they forced themselves to do sales calls, support tickets, and customer onboarding. They understood the pain because they lived it with their users.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: The Subscription Economy Arrives

**Perfect Timing**

Chargebee launched just as the subscription economy shifted from niche to mainstream.

Netflix had proven that streaming subscriptions could work. Salesforce had proven that enterprise software could be subscription-based. Adobe was moving to Creative Cloud. The entire software industry was shifting from perpetual licenses to recurring revenue.

Every new subscription company needed billing infrastructure. Chargebee was ready.

**The Global Push**

From Chennai, Chargebee expanded globally. The founders opened a presence in San Francisco—necessary for selling to American companies—while keeping engineering in India.

The model worked: Indian cost efficiency with American market access. The same playbook that Zoho had pioneered.

**The Funding**

As the company grew, venture capital finally came:
- 2018: $18 million Series D
- 2020: $55 million Series E
- 2021: $125 million Series F

In April 2021, Chargebee achieved unicorn status—valued at $1.4 billion.

The college friends who started saving in 2004 had built a billion-dollar company.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: From Apartment to Global Infrastructure

**The Customers**

Today, Chargebee powers subscription billing for thousands of companies across 53+ countries. From early-stage startups to public companies, businesses rely on Chargebee to manage their recurring revenue.

The platform has expanded beyond basic billing:
- Revenue recognition
- Dunning management (recovering failed payments)
- Analytics and reporting
- Quote-to-cash workflows

**The Chennai Story**

Chargebee remains headquartered in Chennai, with a global presence in San Francisco and beyond. The founders never forgot their roots.

Their success—along with Zoho's and Freshworks'—has helped establish Chennai as a legitimate SaaS hub. The city that global tech once overlooked has produced multiple unicorns.

**Krish Subramanian Today**

Subramanian remains CEO, steering Chargebee through the competitive subscription management landscape. He's become an advocate for building global companies from India—proof that you don't need to be in Silicon Valley to build world-class infrastructure.

**The Lesson**

The most remarkable thing about Chargebee isn't the technology or the valuation. It's the patience.

In 2004, four friends started saving for a company that wouldn't exist for seven years. They built a war chest without knowing what they'd build. They bet on each other before they bet on an idea.

The subscription economy rewarded them. But their own discipline made it possible.

Sometimes the best startup strategy is to save 20% of your salary. Every month. For seven years.

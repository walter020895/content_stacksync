# THE INBOX REIMAGINED: The Origin Story of Front

## I. THE HOOK: Pitching Email to the Creators of Email

San Francisco, 2014.

Mathilde Collin is sitting across from two men who know more about email than almost anyone alive.

Geoff Ralston—creator of Yahoo Mail. Paul Buchheit—creator of Gmail.

She's about to tell them that email is broken.

Collin is 26 years old, French, and has been working on Front for less than a year. The product is a shared inbox—a way for teams to collaborate on emails to addresses like support@company.com or sales@company.com. Instead of forwarding, CCing, and losing track, teams can comment, assign, and respond together.

She's almost embarrassed to pitch it. "We're 'just' a team inbox product," she thinks.

But as she explains the pain point—the chaos of shared email, the lost customer messages, the endless internal forwarding—the men who invented modern email start nodding.

They've seen this problem. They know it's real.

Front is accepted into Y Combinator's Summer 2014 batch.

The "just" an inbox product will eventually be worth over a billion dollars.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: The French Engineer Who Wanted to Love Work

**Growing Up in France**

Mathilde Collin grew up in France watching adults trudge through their jobs. Everyone dreaded Mondays. Everyone complained about hours. Everyone resented their bosses.

It struck her as tragic.

"If I'm going to spend half of my waking hours doing one thing," she thought, "I certainly hope I'm going to like it."

This wasn't just career advice—it became a founding philosophy. She would build a company where work didn't have to be miserable. And she'd build products that made other people's work less miserable too.

**HEC and the First Job**

Collin earned her master's degree from HEC School of Management—one of France's elite business schools. She started her first job and immediately encountered a pain she'd carry into Front: the chaos of shared email.

Team inboxes were disasters. Customer messages got lost. Nobody knew who was responding to what. The tools designed for personal email failed completely when applied to team communication.

**Meeting Laurent Perrin**

At eFounders—a French startup studio—Collin met Laurent Perrin, an engineer with the technical skills to match her product vision.

Together, they brainstormed: what if email could be collaborative? What if shared inboxes worked like live documents—with comments, assignments, and drafts visible to the whole team? What if you could bring the transparency of tools like Google Docs to email?

In October 2013, they started building Front.

## III. THE GRIND: From Paris to Y Combinator

**Nine Months of Building**

Collin and Perrin worked obsessively. The product needed to feel familiar—it was still email—but with an entirely new collaboration layer on top.

The core features emerged:
- Shared inboxes that entire teams could access
- Comments on emails (visible to teammates, invisible to customers)
- Assignment and ownership of messages
- Tags and organization for tracking
- Collision detection (so two people don't respond to the same email)

By March 2014—six months after starting—they had a working product and a dozen test companies using it.

They applied to Y Combinator.

**The Interview**

The Y Combinator interview was intimidating for any founder. For Collin, it was especially nerve-wracking.

She was pitching an email product to people who had literally invented modern email. Geoff Ralston built Yahoo Mail. Paul Buchheit built Gmail. What could a 26-year-old French entrepreneur tell them about email?

But the partners recognized the problem. Personal email tools like Gmail were phenomenal—for personal email. Team email was a different beast. The pain was real. The solution was obvious once someone articulated it.

Front was accepted into the Summer 2014 batch.

**Moving to San Francisco**

Collin and Perrin left France for San Francisco. The Y Combinator program was intense—twelve weeks of building, learning, and preparing for Demo Day.

In June 2014, nine months after writing the first code, Front launched publicly.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: The Invisible Collaboration Layer

**The "Just" a Product**

Collin was self-conscious about Front's simplicity. Compared to the world-changing ambitions of other YC startups, "team inbox" sounded small.

But simplicity was the strength. Front didn't try to replace email—it enhanced it. Teams could adopt Front without changing their workflows. Customers still emailed regular addresses. The magic happened behind the scenes.

**The Enterprise Discovery**

Early customers revealed something unexpected: Front wasn't just for startups.

Enterprise companies—with massive customer support operations, complex sales processes, and distributed teams—had the same problems at scale. They were drowning in shared inboxes. They were losing customer messages. They were paying for expensive enterprise solutions that didn't actually work.

Front expanded from startup tool to enterprise platform.

**The Funding**

As Front grew, funding followed:
- 2016: $10 million Series A
- 2018: $66 million Series B
- 2020: $59 million Series C
- 2022: $65 million Series D

The company reached unicorn status—valued at over $1 billion.

The "just" a team inbox product had become a major enterprise software company.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: Building a Company People Love

**The Culture Obsession**

Collin never forgot her childhood observation: most people hated their jobs. She was determined that Front would be different.

She became known for radical transparency—sharing revenue numbers, strategy documents, even board decks with the entire company. She prioritized culture as a competitive advantage, believing that happy employees built better products.

The approach worked. Front consistently ranked as one of the best places to work in tech.

**The Product Expansion**

Front expanded beyond shared inboxes:
- Integration with CRM systems
- SMS and social media support
- Analytics and reporting
- Workflow automation

The vision grew: not just email collaboration, but customer communication platform.

**The Customers**

By the 2020s, over 8,000 companies used Front—from startups to enterprises like Mailchimp, HubSpot, and LVMH. The product that Collin was embarrassed to pitch had become essential infrastructure for customer-facing teams.

**Mathilde Collin Today**

Collin remains CEO, one of the few female founders to build a billion-dollar enterprise software company. She's become a voice for women in tech and for building human-centric companies.

Her founding insight—that email collaboration was broken—proved correct. But her deeper insight—that you could build a great company where people actually liked working—proved just as valuable.

The girl who watched French adults dread Mondays built a company where Mondays might actually be okay.

# THE ESTONIAN GARAGE: The Origin Story of Pipedrive

## I. THE HOOK: The Salespeople Who Hated Sales Software

Tallinn, Estonia. 2010.

Timo Rein and Urmas Purde are running a sales training company called VAIN & Partners. They teach businesses across the Baltics how to sell—cold calling, pipeline management, closing techniques. They've been doing this for years.

And every time they log into their CRM, they want to throw their laptops across the room.

Salesforce is powerful. Enterprise. Comprehensive. It's also designed for massive sales organizations with dedicated administrators. For a small team trying to track their own training session sales? It's a nightmare of complexity.

"We had to manage the sales of our own training sessions," Purde would later explain. Every day, they used tools built for Fortune 500 companies to manage a handful of deals. Every day, they thought: *There has to be a better way.*

One day, they stop complaining and start building.

In an Estonian garage, five co-founders begin sketching out what a CRM *should* look like—if it were built for the actual humans who sell, not the executives who buy software.

## II. THE BACKSTORY: Salespeople Building for Salespeople

**The VAIN & Partners Experience**

Timo Rein and Urmas Purde weren't software engineers. They were salespeople. They ran VAIN & Partners, a sales training and consulting firm in the Baltics, teaching companies how to build and manage sales teams.

This background mattered.

Most CRMs were built by software engineers imagining what salespeople needed. Pipedrive would be built by salespeople who lived the pain every day.

**The Co-Founding Team**

In 2010, five co-founders came together:

- **Timo Rein**: The sales trainer with a vision for visual pipeline management
- **Urmas Purde**: Rein's partner at VAIN & Partners, focused on sales and customer experience
- **Ragnar Sass**: The technology co-founder
- **Martin Tajur**: Engineering backbone
- **Martin Henk**: Technical co-founder

Each brought a different piece of the puzzle. But the unifying thread was the frustration: sales tools were built for IT departments to purchase, not for salespeople to use.

## III. THE GRIND: From Garage to AngelPad

**The Estonian Garage**

The first version of Pipedrive (originally called "Growty") was built in a literal garage in Estonia. No fancy offices. No Silicon Valley pedigree. Just five Estonians who believed they could build a better CRM.

The core insight was *visual pipeline management*—borrowed from kanban boards used in manufacturing and agile software development. Instead of lists and spreadsheets, sales opportunities would move through columns representing deal stages. Drag a deal from "Contacted" to "Meeting Scheduled." Drag it from "Proposal Sent" to "Closed Won."

The visualization wasn't just prettier—it was *actionable*. A glance at the pipeline told you exactly where your deals were and what needed attention.

**Public Beta: January 2011**

In January 2011, Pipedrive launched its public beta. The product was rough, but the concept resonated immediately with small sales teams exhausted by enterprise complexity.

By the end of 2011: 300 customers.

**AngelPad: The Only European**

Later in 2011, Pipedrive joined AngelPad, the prestigious Silicon Valley accelerator. They were the only European startup among the 15 teams in their batch.

The Estonian underdogs had made it to California.

**Explosive Growth**

The product-market fit was undeniable:
- End of 2011: ~300 customers
- End of 2013: ~7,000 customers

By 2020, over 95,000 companies used Pipedrive.

The garage was long gone. The company had moved to real offices in Tallinn, then expanded globally.

## IV. THE BREAKTHROUGH: The Anti-Salesforce

**Simplicity as Strategy**

Pipedrive's positioning was deliberately oppositional. Salesforce was complex, expensive, and required administrators. Pipedrive was simple, affordable, and designed for self-service.

The target was crystal clear: small and medium-sized businesses. Teams of 5-50 salespeople who didn't have IT departments but still needed to manage their pipelines.

**Activity-Based Selling**

The philosophy went beyond the interface. Pipedrive embraced "activity-based selling"—the idea that salespeople can't directly control outcomes (you can't force someone to buy), but they can control activities (calls made, emails sent, meetings held).

The platform was designed around this insight. Instead of obsessing over revenue forecasts, Pipedrive encouraged users to focus on the actions that led to revenue.

**The Kanban CRM**

The visual pipeline—the kanban board for sales—became Pipedrive's signature. Competitors copied it. But Pipedrive had first-mover advantage in the visual, activity-focused CRM space.

## V. THE AFTERMATH: Estonia's Fifth Unicorn

**Vista Equity Partners**

In November 2020, Vista Equity Partners—a U.S. private equity firm specializing in enterprise software—took a majority stake in Pipedrive. The deal valued the company at $1.5 billion.

Pipedrive became Estonia's fifth unicorn, joining the ranks of Skype, TransferWise (now Wise), Bolt, and Playtech.

**From Tallinn to the World**

Though founded in Estonia, Pipedrive moved its headquarters to New York as it scaled. But the Estonian engineering hub remained the heart of the company's development.

Estonia, a country of 1.3 million people, had produced yet another globally significant tech company—a testament to the country's digital-first culture and startup ecosystem.

**The Legacy of Urmas Purde**

In March 2022, tragedy struck. Urmas Purde, co-founder and longtime leader of sales and customer experience, died at age 46 in an accident in Bali, Indonesia.

Purde had been instrumental in shaping Pipedrive's culture and customer-centric approach. In 2021, he was awarded The Order of the White Star, 4th Class, by the President of Estonia—recognition of his contribution to entrepreneurship.

His death was a profound loss for the company and the Estonian tech community.

**Where Pipedrive Is Now**

Today, Pipedrive serves over 100,000 companies worldwide. The visual pipeline that started as a frustration-fueled sketch in an Estonian garage has become standard in sales software.

The salespeople who hated their CRM built one that salespeople actually love.

And from a country most people couldn't find on a map, they built a billion-dollar company that competes with Silicon Valley giants.

# FRESHWORKS: The GTM Study

## Executive Summary

Freshworks' go-to-market genius wasn't building better software—it was reading a comment on the internet. When Zendesk raised prices 60-300% in 2010, a Hacker News comment said "there's a huge opening for someone to come in and take all of Zendesk's customers." That comment was a "slap on the face" to Girish Mathrubootham, who had spent 9 years at Zoho building exactly this kind of software. He quit, founded Freshdesk in Chennai, and built the first Indian SaaS company to IPO on NASDAQ—reaching $13B valuation. **The core lesson: The best market research is watching customers revolt against your would-be competitor.**

## Part 1: The Genesis (Pre-Product)

### The Origin Story

Girish Mathrubootham was 36 years old, married with two boys, living in Chennai. He had spent **9 years at Zoho Corporation** (called AdventNet when he joined in 2001), rising from PreSales Engineer to VP of Product Management at ManageEngine.

He knew customer support software intimately—had been building on-premise helpdesk systems since 2004.

But he was comfortable. Safe. Then came the comment.

### The Hacker News Comment

On May 18, 2010, an article appeared on Hacker News: "Zendesk raises their prices 60%-300%, users predictably revolt."

One comment changed everything. User **megamark16** wrote:

> "Whenever I read something like this I can't help but think—here's a potential customer... It seems like there still is a huge opening in this market for someone to come in and take all of Zendesk and eSupport's customers."

Girish's reaction:

> "That comment was like a slap on my face. Here was an opportunity sitting right in front of me. I had the domain knowledge and I knew that a massive transition to cloud is happening. The spidey sense in me told me that I should throw in my hat into the ring. That was the exact moment that I decided that I should build something in the customer support market delivered as SaaS."

### The Personal Stakes

Girish couldn't sleep for weeks. The excitement was real, but so was the fear:
- School fees for two children
- Home mortgage
- Comfortable VP salary to give up
- Building from Chennai, not Silicon Valley

He researched every company in the space before telling anyone—including his wife.

### The Launch

- **October 13, 2010:** Launched Freshdesk
- **Location:** A rented 700 square foot warehouse meeting room in Chennai
- **Co-founder:** Shan Krishnasamy, his colleague at Zoho—"a talented technical architect"
- **Domain:** Backordered freshdesk.com on GoDaddy when he noticed it was expiring (took a month to transfer)

## Part 2: The First Customers (0 → 100)

### The First Customer

Freshdesk's first paying customer was **Atwell College in Australia**—9,000+ kilometers from Chennai.

The timeline was remarkable: **103 days from launch to 100 customers.**

### The Zendesk Rivalry: "Freaking Ripoff"

In December 2011, Freshdesk had 200 customers. Zendesk had 20,000+.

A blogger named Ben Kepes tweeted:
> "Seems to me that #Freshdesk is an unethical troll trying to cash in on #Zendesk's good name"

Then Zendesk CEO Mikkel Svane tweeted:
> "WAIT-WHAT-A-FREAKING-RIP-OFF"

Others called Freshdesk "a bunch of Indian cowboys."

### The Response

Freshdesk created **www.ripoffornot.org**, displaying Zendesk's accusation and inviting users to try Freshdesk and "decide for yourself."

The post went viral. Twitter rallied behind the underdog.

Girish later reflected:
> "The whole world was supporting us. It turned into a phenomenal PR moment."

> "By attacking us they put us in the same plane as themselves, and from that point onwards we never let go of the slot."

(Note: Ben Kepes was later revealed to be a "paid blogger" for Zendesk, with his company listing Zendesk as a consulting client.)

### The Microsoft BizSpark Win

In 2011, Freshdesk won the **Microsoft BizSpark India Startup Challenge**—$40,000 prize.

Girish called it "the oxygen supply for a bootstrapped company."

They spent $45,000 of it over two months on marketing, testing which online channels would scale.

### Early Traction Tactics

| Tactic | Specific Execution | Why It Worked |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Pricing as weapon** | $9, $19, $29/month vs. Zendesk's higher prices | Undercut the incumbent dramatically |
| **Zendesk defectors** | Tweeted when Zendesk customers complained; offered to match remaining contracts free | Captured angry customers at moment of frustration |
| **Inbound-first** | 80% marketing, 20% sales in CAC | Scaled from low-cost Chennai location |
| **"Fortune 5 Million"** | Targeted SMBs ignored by Salesforce, ServiceNow | Built where enterprise vendors wouldn't go |

---

## Part 3: The Distribution Insight

### The Core GTM Mechanism

**Freshworks built global from India—proving you don't need Silicon Valley to win SaaS.**

Girish's philosophy: "Scale like Silicon Valley, build like India."

The model:
- **Go global and go inbound from India**
- Spend heavily on online marketing and acquisitions
- Service leads from low-cost Chennai location
- Run up to 4,000 marketing campaigns per year worldwide

Results:
- Sales cost was 20% of CAC; marketing was 80%
- Campaigns account for ~70% of revenue
- 50-100% year-over-year growth during hypergrowth

### The "Fortune 5 Million" Positioning

Girish reframed the market:

> "Some people build software for the Fortune 500. We build software for the not-so-fortunate five million."

This meant targeting:
- Non-profits
- Educational institutions
- Small businesses
- "People who can't go and do business with Salesforce, or ServiceNow, or Zendesk"

### Why Building from Chennai Worked

Conventional wisdom said SaaS companies needed to be in San Francisco. Girish disagreed:

> "We wanted to prove that you can build world-class software from Chennai, that you don't have to be born in the Valley to build a global company."

The Chennai advantages:
- Lower costs meant longer runway
- Time zone coverage (support could run 24/7 with global team)
- Talent pool that was eager to prove itself
- No Silicon Valley competition for employees

The Chennai challenges overcome:
- "Very little 'been there, done that' talent"
- Had to bet on "innate talent" over experience
- Ruby on Rails was their language until employee #69—didn't hire anyone who knew Rails because they could learn

### Landing Enterprise from Chennai

Between 2013-2014, Freshdesk closed:
- Burger King (300 seats vs. typical SMB 4-5 seats)
- 3M
- Schneider Electric
- Pearson
- Sony

**All came inbound. All closed from Chennai over the phone.**

## Part 4: The Inflection Point

### The IPO: First Indian SaaS on NASDAQ

**September 22, 2021:** Freshworks became the first Indian SaaS company to list on NASDAQ.

- Shares sold: 28.5 million
- Raised: $1.03 billion
- First day: Opened at $43.50 (+21%), closed at $47.55

### Peak Valuation: $13 Billion

### Wealth Creation

The IPO created **500+ crorepatis** (millionaires worth at least Rs 10 million / ~$125,000) in India:
- 70 were below age 30
- 76% of 4,300 employees globally held equity options

Girish on wealth sharing:
> "I personally believe it's well-deserved and that all our employees have earned it. Because all of these employees have truly contributed to Freshworks, and I truly believe that wealth has to be shared with the people who created it. It's not just for the founders to get rich or the investors to get rich."

### Evidence of Inflection

| Metric | 2012 | 2021 | Growth |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Revenue | $2.5M | $371M | **14,740%** |

- Undercut Zendesk pricing
- Inbound from Chennai

#### Phase 2: Multi-Product (2014-2017)
- Freshservice (ITSM, 2014)
- Freshsales (CRM, 2016)
- Rebranded to Freshworks Inc. (2017)

### SaaSBoomi: Building the Indian SaaS Ecosystem

In 2015, Girish co-launched **SaaSBoomi** with ~70 other SaaS founders:
- First conference (SaaSx) held in Chennai
- Now 4,000+ member community
- Pay-it-forward ethic

When started, Freshworks was the biggest company at $5M revenue. There were only 40 companies building global SaaS from India.

Girish's philosophy:
> "Hey, it's not about Freshworks. People have advised me, why are you opening up and sharing your playbooks and numbers? You're giving away your secret. I said it's not about Freshworks. It's about India's need for employment."

### Current GTM Footprint

| Channel | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Inbound/PLG** | SMB self-serve, freemium, campaigns |
| **Inside sales** | Mid-market qualification and closing |
| **Enterprise sales** | Large accounts, field sales |
| **Partner channel** | Resellers and implementation partners |
| **Product-led growth** | Free tiers drive adoption and upgrade |

## Key Lessons for Founders

### Lesson 1: Customer Revolts Are Market Signals

The Zendesk pricing increase and customer backlash was visible to anyone paying attention. Girish was paying attention.

**Application:** Monitor Hacker News, Twitter, Reddit, and review sites for competitor backlash. Angry customers are warm leads.

### Lesson 2: Attack the Incumbent at Their Moment of Weakness

Freshdesk didn't just compete with Zendesk—it launched right when Zendesk had angered its user base.

**Application:** Time your market entry to coincide with competitor missteps. Offer to match remaining contracts for defectors.

### Lesson 3: Location Is Not Destiny

Building from Chennai proved you don't need Silicon Valley for global SaaS. The cost advantages extended runway; the talent was hungry.

**Application:** Consider non-traditional locations. Lower costs and motivated talent can be advantages, not limitations.

### Lesson 4: Turn Attacks Into Marketing

When Zendesk's CEO called Freshdesk a "freaking ripoff," the response turned it into a David vs. Goliath story that media and customers loved.

**Application:** If an incumbent attacks you, lean into it. The attention and sympathy can be worth more than any paid campaign.

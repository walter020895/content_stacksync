# SERVICENOW: The GTM Study

## Executive Summary

ServiceNow's go-to-market genius wasn't the software—it was the audacity of starting over at 50 after losing everything. Fred Luddy had spent 13 years as CTO at Peregrine Systems, accumulating $35 million in stock. When accounting fraud sent executives to prison and his fortune to zero, most people would have retired defeated. Luddy started a company two weeks before his 50th birthday—giving software away for free to get feedback, driving door-to-door in San Diego looking for customers, and building one of the most successful enterprise software companies ever. **The core lesson: Rock bottom creates clarity. The best time to start is when you have nothing left to lose.**

## Part 1: The Genesis (Pre-Product)

### The Origin Story

Fred Luddy's path to ServiceNow was forged in adversity.

**Difficult childhood:**
> "My father was continually disappointed in my performance. This is something that lasted for 30 years. I got poor grades, and my father always told me I would never amount to anything. He told me I was stupid. And he hit me whenever he thought I was anywhere near out of line."

At 16, Luddy left home:
> "I was 16 and feeling like I would be better off on my own... I had $180 in savings and I took my parents' station wagon and drove straight to California, camping along the way. I became a strawberry picker because you got paid in cash at the end of the day."

He dropped out of Indiana University because he was "spending too much time doing computer programming."

### The Peregrine Disaster

Luddy spent **13 years as CTO at Peregrine Systems**, an IT management software company once valued at $4 billion.

His stake: **$35 million in company stock.**

Then accounting fraud sent the CEO, CFO, and Head of Sales to prison. The stock went to zero. Peregrine filed bankruptcy.

Luddy's reflection:
> "I lost everything overnight. My company stock was worth zero. I was 49 years old and realized I would have to start all over."

> "At the time, I thought this was the worst thing that could or would ever happen to me, but I was wrong because in the end it was the best thing."

### Starting at 50

Despite swearing off IT service management, Luddy's "definition of never was about nine months."

He founded Glidesoft on **November 5, 2003**:
> "It was November 5th, 2003. I knew that we had to start a company before I became 50, because a 50-year-old can't start a company. So, at 49—November 24th is my birthday—we started."

The company began with:
- A single laptop at a desk
- Fred as the only employee
- Building from his house

### The Initial Hypothesis

The insight came from decades watching IT software frustrate users:

1. **Software should serve the user, not the admin.** Help desk agents spend 8 hours a day in these tools. Why are they designed for managers reviewing reports, not agents doing work?

2. **Simplicity wins.** Enterprise software had become bloated. Luddy believed extreme simplicity and modularity would last.

3. **Cloud delivery changes everything.** Instead of painful on-premise deployments, software could be a service.

## Part 2: The First Customers (0 → 100)

### Door-to-Door Selling

With no resources and no sales team, Luddy took to the road:

> "In 2004, two weeks before his 50th birthday, Fred Luddy launched ServiceNow from his house—with no resources and no sales team to pitch the product. He took to the road, driving up and down San Diego County, looking for prospective customers."

### Free Software for Feedback

Luddy's early sales pitch:
> "Would you please use our software for free?"

In exchange for free usage, early customers provided feedback. The first ten customers shaped the product.

This wasn't desperation—it was strategy:
> "They worked with customers on a day in, day out basis because they wanted to make sure they were properly engaged and actually deriving value from the software. This turned out to be a really good way of getting into the market."

### The Volunteer Team

A handful of people believed so strongly in what Luddy was building that they **worked for free**—some are still at ServiceNow today.

### First Paying Customer

**September 2004:** WagerWorks became the first customer to pay for services.

Early customers included:
- Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (developers met at this cafe)
- Qualcomm
- TIAA-CREF
- Cricket Communications
- MetLife
- Burlington Coat Factory

### Early Funding

| Round | Date | Amount | Investor |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| Starting capital | Early 2004 | $9.3M | Paul Barber |
| Venture financing | Mid-2005 | $2.5M | JMI Equity |

The JMI money allowed hiring five additional people.

### Early Traction Tactics

| Tactic | Specific Execution | Why It Worked |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Free for feedback** | First 10 customers used it free | Built product with real users; created advocates |
| **Door-to-door** | Luddy personally drove San Diego County | Hustle compensated for no brand or budget |
| **Day-to-day engagement** | Constant contact with early customers | Ensured they derived value; caught issues early |
| **Volunteer believers** | Team worked unpaid initially | True believers became core team |

## Part 3: The Distribution Insight

### The Core GTM Mechanism

**ServiceNow grew by landing in IT, then expanding to every department.**

The "land and expand" model:
1. Enter organization through IT department (ITSM)
2. Prove value with help desk transformation
3. Expand to HR, Customer Service, Security, Finance
4. Become the workflow platform for the entire enterprise

Customer expansion metric: Customers who started in 2010 with ~$100K ACV now average **$4.3M annually**—43x expansion over 15 years.

### The VMware Acquisition Offer

In 2012, VMware offered to acquire ServiceNow for **$2.5 billion**.

Luddy was ready to sell:
> "At the time, I was about 55 years old. I'd been bankrupt twice. I had a new child. So, this is a chance to be not bankrupt."

Sequoia's Doug Leone opposed the sale, arguing the company could reach $10 billion valuation.

The board ultimately rejected VMware. By end of 2012, market cap was $3.7 billion—$1.2 billion more than the offer.

By 2014: $10 billion valuation (Leone's prediction came true).

### The Frank Slootman Era (2011-2017)

Sequoia brought in Frank Slootman to scale the company. ServiceNow was:
> "90 days from going out of business" (Doug Leone)—being "buried under its own success"

The transition was hard for Luddy:
> "The first 90 to 120 days that Frank was CEO was probably the most difficult of my career. I was used to being a benevolent autocrat at the corporation."

Slootman's results:
- Revenue: $100M → $1.4B
- IPO: June 2012
- Built the enterprise sales machine

### Why This Worked (At That Moment)

Three conditions enabled ServiceNow's rise:

1. **SaaS was becoming enterprise-accepted.** Salesforce had proved cloud software could be trusted. IT departments were warming to it.

2. **ITSM incumbents were stale.** BMC, CA, HP—the legacy players—had stopped innovating. Products were old and painful.

3. **"Digital transformation" created budget.** Every company was modernizing IT. ServiceNow was the vehicle for that modernization.

## Part 4: The Inflection Point

### The IPO (June 2012)

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Date | June 29, 2012 |
| Price | $18/share |
| Shares | 11.65 million |
| Lead banks | Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank |

## Part 5: GTM Evolution (Post-PMF)

### How the Strategy Evolved

#### Phase 1: Scrappy Startup (2003-2011)
- Fred Luddy driving door-to-door
- Free software for feedback
- IT help desk focus only
- Less than 10% of revenue on sales/marketing

#### Phase 2: Enterprise Scale (2011-2017)
- Frank Slootman builds sales machine
- IPO and rapid growth
- Multi-product expansion (HR Service Delivery, Customer Service)
- Partner ecosystem development

#### Phase 3: Platform Company (2017-Present)
- Bill McDermott as CEO (2019-present)
- Now Platform as foundation
- AI integration ("AI control tower")
- Revenue: $10B+ with 20%+ growth

### The Multi-Product GTM Transition

Around $1B revenue (2014), ServiceNow made a critical decision:

Kevin Haverty (former CRO):
> "When we hit about a billion, we needed more products to continue the growth. There was still plenty more to get inside IT, but to get to the big numbers, you really need to be in multiple domains."

The reorganization:
- Went from 1 GTM team to 5 in one month
- Created GM structure with 4 functional units + platform
- Hired HR specialists, ITOM specialists, security specialists, customer service specialists

Early mistake:
> "We had a tendency to try to sell the new product to our existing users or champions... We wasted a lot of time trying to sell customer service management to the person who runs IT."

Solution:
> "Know who the buying persona is and be able to get to them. Then, when you get to them, know how to speak their language."

### Partner Evolution

Early: Partners were seen as competition by internal sales.

Today:
- Partners drive **80-90% of new bookings**
- Source **20% of deals**
- Deliver **90-95% of implementations**
- Accenture alone has 8,000+ ServiceNow experts

### Bill McDermott Era (2019-Present)

Under McDermott:
- Revenue: $3.5B → $11B+
- 20%+ growth every year
- AI positioning: "The AI control tower for business reinvention"
- 85%+ of Fortune 500 as customers

McDermott's philosophy:
> "Staying hungry and humble is not just advantageous for us—it's the bedrock of our organic growth strategy. Complacency is the enemy of innovation."

### Current GTM Footprint

| Channel | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Enterprise sales** | C-suite relationships, large deals ($50M+ possible) |
| **Partners** | Drive majority of bookings and implementations |
| **Land and expand** | Start in IT, expand to HR, Customer Service, etc. |
| **Now Platform** | Developers build on platform, creates stickiness |
| **Industry solutions** | Verticalized offerings for specific sectors |

## Key Lessons for Founders

### Lesson 1: Adversity Creates Founders

Luddy lost $35 million to fraud at 49 years old. Most people would have given up. Instead:
> "I believe that adversity is what makes you who you are. Losing my job and my life's earnings was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I wasn't happy, and that situation forced me to figure out exactly what I wanted."

**Application:** Rock bottom provides clarity. If you've lost everything, you have nothing left to fear.

### Lesson 2: Give Away Software to Get Feedback

The first 10 customers used ServiceNow free. In exchange, they shaped the product into something people would pay for.

**Application:** Early customers are partners, not revenue sources. Their feedback is worth more than their subscription fees.

### Lesson 3: Land and Expand Requires Patience

ServiceNow customers who started at $100K now pay $4.3M annually. That 43x expansion took 15 years.

**Application:** Land-and-expand models compound over time. Early cohorts become your largest customers if you execute expansion well.

### Lesson 4: Know When to Bring in Operating Executives

Luddy built the product and early traction. Slootman scaled the company. McDermott is taking it to the next level. Different phases required different leaders.

**Application:** Founder skills and CEO skills are different. The best outcome for the company may involve evolving leadership.

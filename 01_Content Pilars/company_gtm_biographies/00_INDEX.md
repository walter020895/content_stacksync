## GTM Pattern Categories

### Category Creators
Companies that invented new markets rather than competing in existing ones:
- **HubSpot**: Coined "inbound marketing"
- **Salesforce**: Made "No Software" a movement
- **Snowflake**: "The Data Cloud" (not just data warehouse)

### Incumbent Attackers
Companies that positioned explicitly against dominant players:
- **Supabase**: "Open-source Firebase alternative"
- **MariaDB**: Fork MySQL to escape Oracle
- **Freshworks**: Exploit Zendesk's pricing backlash
- **Shopify**: "Arming the rebels" vs. Amazon

### Developer-First / PLG
Companies that let product lead growth:
- **MongoDB**: Free download, community adoption
- **Zendesk**: No sales until $10M run rate
- **Airtable**: Word-of-mouth and IKEA effect
- **Supabase**: Developer memes and vibe coding

### Enterprise Land-and-Expand
Companies that entered through one department and expanded:
- **ServiceNow**: IT → HR → Customer Service → Finance
- **Snowflake**: One team → consumption growth → enterprise contract

## LinkedIn Content Angles

### By Hook Type

**Origin Stories:**
- "Fred Luddy lost $35 million at 49. Started ServiceNow two weeks before turning 50."
- "Shopify started because Tobi Lütke couldn't sell snowboards."
- "A comment on Hacker News built a $13 billion company." (Freshworks)

**Contrarian Insights:**
- "Everyone bet on Hadoop. Snowflake bet against it."
- "No sales team until $10 million. That was the rule." (Zendesk)
- "90% of spreadsheets have no formulas. Airtable saw what Excel missed."

**Specific Numbers:**
- "8 databases to 800 in 3 days. One word changed everything." (Supabase)
- "158% net dollar retention. That's not a metric—that's a moat." (Snowflake)
- "103 days. 100 customers. All from Chennai." (Freshworks)

**Drama/Conflict:**
- "Zendesk's CEO called Freshdesk a 'freaking ripoff.' Best marketing they ever got."
- "VMware offered $2.5B. The board said no. Market cap: $140B." (ServiceNow)
- "Siebel called the police on Salesforce. Best thing that ever happened to them."

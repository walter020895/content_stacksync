# Stacksync Content Creation Process
## Step-by-Step Framework

---

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH (Before Writing Anything)

### Step 1: Understand the Subject

**If it's a product/connector post:**
- Read the product page (features, benefits, pain points)
- Identify the ICP (who feels this pain?)
- List competitors and their limitations

**If it's a company/person post:**
- Read company biography or research doc
- Find the origin story (the non-obvious angle)
- Identify key numbers, dates, names
- Find quotes from founders/executives

**If it's an event post:**
- Who's speaking? What's their credibility?
- What's the hook? (Why should anyone care?)
- What's the ICP connection?

### Step 2: Gather Outlier Data

Look at what's already working:
- Check `/04_linkedin_content/Bangers/` for proven formats
- Review outlier patterns:

| Pattern | Engagement | When to Use |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Fortune Teller | 1,527 avg (69% higher) | Predictions, industry shifts |
| Short Punch | Underused, high impact | Direct product posts |
| "Wrong" Pattern | 9x outlier | Challenging assumptions |
| "I Studied" | Research credibility | Playbook breakdowns |
| Number Stack | Authority signal | Company/funding stories |

### Step 3: Identify the Voice

**Ruben (CEO):**
- Admits failures ("We tried X. Failed.")
- Names specific tools
- Uses specific numbers
- Pattern: Problem → Failed Solutions → Built It

**Alexis (CTO):**
- Intense, direct
- "OBSESSED" energy
- Short sentences
- Productivity/leverage focus

**Nacho (GTM):**
- Frameworks and playbooks
- "The part most people miss..."
- Studies companies, draws insights
- Operator perspective

## PHASE 2: KALLAWAY ANALYSIS (Before Writing)

### Step 4: Define the Four Pillars

| Pillar | Question to Answer |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Hook Archetype** | Contrarian? Fortune Teller? Teacher? Experimenter? |
| **Desire Mapping** | TIME? MONEY? STATUS? TRUST? |
| **Story Lens** | What's the unique angle nobody takes? |
| **Ending First** | What's the one-liner takeaway? Write it now. |

### Step 5: Write the 3-Step Hook

Every hook needs three parts:

1. **Context Lean** — Familiar situation the reader recognizes
2. **Scroll Stop** — The unexpected twist
3. **Contra Snap** — The reframe that makes them keep reading

**Example:**
- Context Lean: "Every ops team eventually asks engineering for a NetSuite integration"
- Scroll Stop: "What they get isn't an integration"
- Contra Snap: "It's a nightly batch job that's stale by the time anyone looks at it"

---

## PHASE 3: WRITE VARIATIONS (Not Just One)

### Step 6: Create 4-6 Hook Variations

Never write just one version. Create variations using different outlier patterns:

| Variation | Hook Type | Example Opening |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| A | Contrarian | "Everyone thinks X. They're wrong." |
| B | Experimenter | "We tested every tool. Same problem." |
| C | Fortune Teller | "In 12 months, nobody will..." |
| D | Short Punch | [Under 50 words, direct statement] |
| E | Origin Story | "I spent 8 months trying to..." |
| F | GTM Angle | "Hot take: Your ERP is the most overlooked..." |

### Step 7: Write Full Posts for Top 3 Hooks

For each variation:
- Write the full post
- Keep sentences short
- Use white space
- End with a strong closer (reframe or philosophical truth)

---

## PHASE 4: QUALITY CHECKS

### Step 8: Voice Check

| Marker | Ruben | Alexis | Nacho |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Specific numbers | Yes | Sometimes | Yes |
| Names real tools | Yes | No | Yes (companies) |
| Admits struggles | Yes | No | No |
| Frameworks | No | No | Yes |
| Intensity/caps | No | Yes | No |
| Short declarative | Sometimes | Yes | Sometimes |

### Step 9: AI Slops Check

Remove these patterns:

| Slop | Status |
|------|--------|
| "Here's the thing" | Remove |
| "Let that sink in" | Remove |
| "At the end of the day" | Remove |
| "Fundamentally/Ultimately" | Remove |
| "Here's what I learned" | Remove |
| Em dashes (—) | Remove |
| "This isn't X. It's Y." | Remove |
| Arrow bullets in body text | Minimal |
| Colon staging ("The truth:") | Remove |
| "Not X. Y." overused | Limit to once |

## PHASE 5: FORMATTING

- No asterisks for bold (LinkedIn doesn't render)
- No markdown formatting
- Clear "COPY BELOW THIS LINE" markers
- Test that it pastes cleanly

### Step 12: Add Visual Hook Suggestion

For each post, suggest an image:
- Split comparisons (Old vs New)
- Number stacks
- Timeline graphics
- Screenshots (if relevant)
- Before/after

## PHASE 6: FINAL OUTPUT

### Step 13: Recommendation with Reasoning

| Option | Hook Type | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| A | [Type] | [Use case] |
| B | [Type] | [Use case] |
| C | [Type] | [Use case] |

**Top Pick:** [Option] because [specific reason tied to goal]

### Step 14: Comment Strategy

Write the first comment:
- Should add value, not just "link in bio"
- Can be a soft CTA
- Can invite discussion

## QUICK REFERENCE: POST TYPES

### Product/Connector Post
1. Research product page + competitors
2. Identify main pain point
3. Use Contrarian or Short Punch hook
4. Structure: Problem → Failed alternatives → What we built
5. End with clear differentiator

### Company Story Post (Ego-Bait)
1. Deep research on company/founder
2. Find the non-obvious angle
3. Use Fortune Teller or "I Studied" hook
4. Structure: Hook → Evidence cascade → Reframe → Philosophical close
5. Make the subject look good (so they reshare)

### Event Announcement Post
1. Lead with speaker credibility, not event details
2. Use authority signals (funding, companies, titles)
3. Structure: Why these people → Why this matters → CTA
4. Keep CTA simple: "Link in comments"

### GTM/Playbook Post
1. Study the company's GTM deeply
2. Extract 3-5 actionable lessons
3. Use "I Studied" or numbered list format
4. Structure: Company context → The insight → Framework → Application
5. Make it useful enough to save

### Team/Culture Post
1. Use real screenshot or quote
2. Don't repeat what's visible in image
3. Add the insight layer (what this reveals)
4. Keep caption short, let image work

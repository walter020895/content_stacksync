How to Create Irresistible Hooks (and blow up your content)
[00:00:00] Speaker: Today we're talking about hawks if you want your videos to perform better you have to make better hawks but [00:00:05] here's the thing I'm not gonna give you a list of Twenty five proven viral hawks que that's not what you need what you [00:00:10] need is to understand the Psychology behind why those s and then the [00:00:15] tactics for how to use that Psychology in your own stuff so these are gonna be the six best ways to [00:00:20] improve your hooks immediately and if you do all of these i guarantee your videos will perform better.[00:00:25] 
I know this Works que content is all i do i have almost a million followers billions of views and [00:00:30] these are the Secrets i go whenever i want tip number one is actually the me [00:00:35] it's my full three step ho formula and this how i look at social media you are [00:00:40] driving down the Highway at seventy miles an hour i need you to see something stop turn around and come [00:00:45] back the other way.
So how do i get you to do that the way i do that is by building a Curiosity [00:00:50] loop and this is one of the base commandments in storytelling if you wanna tell a great story you need the viewer to watch [00:00:55] the first line and feel so compelled that they can't dream of doing anything else than [00:01:00] watching the second line and the third line and so on the domino effect this is the Curiosity [00:01:05] loop and the deeper the loop the more curious you are the more I've.
So the [00:01:10] question is how do i do that in just three or four CE and the answer is that i built a formula that does this [00:01:15] every single time it's three steps the first step is what i call the context le in the [00:01:20] first line or two i need to do two things one i need to be super clear about what [00:01:25] the video is actually about topic clarity and this is so you as the view can self select in [00:01:30] or out based on your interest if I'm talking about investing.
And you don't care about investing [00:01:35] i actually don't wanna trick you into watching the video because you are not my target viewer but if you do [00:01:40] care about investing i wanna signal this to you as soon as possible so i need to give you immediate [00:01:45] context about the topic the second thing i need to do is get you leaning in context [00:01:50] lean the more you lean in the more curious you are.
These are the easiest ways to get somebody to lean in [00:01:55] establish common ground reference a benefit or pain point they may have use a [00:02:00] metaphor to simplify a complex idea or tell them something so interesting it blows [00:02:05] their mind you need them to be connected and feel like what you're talking about relates to them in some way.
[00:02:10] Let's go through un example one of my videos this is the sphere video i made the eight million views i want you to just watch [00:02:15] the first two lines the tech in the Vegas sphere is insane biggest screen ever [00:02:20] built Twenty times bigger than an imax right away I'm telling you exactly what the context of the video [00:02:25] es.
The sphere and the tech inside and I'm getting you to lean in by talking about the [00:02:30] screen showing it and referencing to how much bigger it is than an imax something you may have known now this is taking [00:02:35] the show you something interesting to blow your mind route of the options and of course not everyone is gonna be [00:02:40] interested in this video but if you heard about the sphere or care about tech in venues.
You're gonna [00:02:45] be leaning in okay, so that's step one now step two is what i call the scroll stop interjection this [00:02:50] is a single line meant to act like a stun gunn i need you to start leaning in and then immediately i need [00:02:55] you to stop being able to move forward like you ran into a window and the best way to do this in practice is [00:03:00] by using a contrasting word i to use the word but you could use things like however yet [00:03:05] although therefore on the other hand.
Things like that and this is more just meant to be a set [00:03:10] up line for the haymaker that's coming in step three in order for them to accept the haymaker you need to [00:03:15] st. First now back in the sphere example let's watch both the context le and the [00:03:20] scroll stop interjection together the tech in the Vegas sphere is insane biggest green.
Ever [00:03:25] built Twenty times bigger than an imax but get this the screen is actually the least [00:03:30] impressive part of the whole thing so at this point I've kind of stun you right i first established context and got you [00:03:35] leaning in about how interesting the fear is talking about the tech and the screen but then i stun you.[00:03:40] 
Told you the screen is actually not impressive at all at this point you're like what could possibly [00:03:45] be coming next i the screen looks huge i can see in the visuals and this is the Curiosity loop [00:03:50] that is building you wondering what is coming next is replacing any thought that could be distracting you and [00:03:55] send you anywhere else time for step three this is the haymaker i call it the contra [00:04:00] snap back.
Nada. The contra back is a sentence that goes in the opposite direction of the [00:04:05] initial le it's still on topic but it snaps the viewer back on a different path and the bigger [00:04:10] the shock the bigger the snap the better the effect so let's finish this sphere example now with all [00:04:15] three parts the tech in the Vegas sphere.
Is insin biggest screen ever built Twenty times bigger [00:04:20] than an imax but get this the screen is actually the least impressive part of the whole [00:04:25] thing because the most impressive part is the audio this is gonna blow your mic at this point I've got you [00:04:30] hook line and sinker i e established context immediately i got you leaning in the case that you were interested in something [00:04:35] about the screen or something new you hadn't seen before then i stand you and play [00:04:40] snapping you back in a different direction instead of talking about the screen.
Now [00:04:45] I'm talking about the audio that is the snap back à this point you are fully and fully curious about what comes next [00:04:50] you can't dream of doing anything else other than learning how this audio es more [00:04:55] impressive than the biggest screen ever built that's hot now it turns out if you go back and you Analyze.
[00:05:00] Best Performing content from any Creator across any medium a of it follows this exact same [00:05:05] formula and it doesn't just have to be the big new style entertainment style [00:05:10] videotape content if im making content as a real estate agent and I'm purely looking to drive leads to my real estate [00:05:15] practice pure bdb i could say something like this there are three massive mistakes people are making with their Mortgage [00:05:20] the average person pays an extra twelve thousand dollars per year now most people think it's because of [00:05:25] high interest rates but it turns out it has nothing to do with that.
Because the biggest waste of money is actually coming from [00:05:30] see what i did there i don't know anything about real estate i don't know what the right answer to that is but just that hook [00:05:35] setup even without me knowing any context i can get you leaning one way and then the other and if [00:05:40] you're a real estate agent and you make content in that format i guarantee that would drive so many leads it [00:05:45] would build you as authority in your Category that's what you wanna do that hook format Works [00:05:50] every Category every space and if you don't believe it Works.
I'm gonna do a magic trick [00:05:55] because i use this same Psychology formula on you for the hook in this video and [00:06:00] if you're still watching that proves it worked let me show you exactly what i did so i started off by saying [00:06:05] this. Today we're talking about hawks if you [00:06:10] want your videos to perform better you have to make better hawks so right away this was me giving [00:06:15] context on exactly what the video was about hawks but also creating common ground and getting you to lean in [00:06:20] around the benefit of making better videos.
If you figure out how to make better hugs this [00:06:25] started building the Curiosity loop in your mind now if you watch just those two sentences and you don't really care about making [00:06:30] videos or making content then that didn't really apply to you and you've probably bounced anyway but if you're at this point right now i guarantee [00:06:35] it's because you're trying to figure out how to make videos to perform better so this built common ground with you which [00:06:40] is my target viewer okay that step one so context it.
So now whats [00:06:45] next the next thing i said was this here's the thing I'm not gonna give you a list of Twenty five proven [00:06:50] hos que that's not what you need this is the scroll stop interjection the stop sign the red light the st. [00:06:55] Gunn and this stops you in your tracks because I'm reiterating what you typically heard [00:07:00] in the past typically you see Creators talk about the list of the forty best proven hooks and then they give you [00:07:05] the list.
But you know this isn't the answer i know that's not the answer so [00:07:10] I'm using that embedded belief in your head that you know it's not the answer to stun you into waiting to see [00:07:15] what comes next this is just the set of line to give the contra snap back but it Works [00:07:20] especially well here because you and i both know that conventional wisdom doesn't work and so I'm playing on [00:07:25] that embedded subconscious belief.
Okay so far you've stopped the car you've exited off the [00:07:30] Highway how do i get you to turn around that is step three so what did i do next this is the last thing i said [00:07:35] what you need is to understand the Psychology behind ws and [00:07:40] then the tactics for how to use that Psychology in your own stuff and this is the contra [00:07:45] snap because most people have heard the word Psychology whether you study Psychology or not you've heard the word Psychology [00:07:50] and you have a suspicion as i delivered it that that actually would result in some.
Surprise or [00:07:55] secret information that's way deeper than the conventional wisdom you hear that and you believe that [00:08:00] to be true so I've snapped you back off the conventional wisdom back to this Psychology frame [00:08:05] which is what I'm talking about so when i say. Hey, if you wanna achieve x don to why do z. And if [00:08:10] you wanna achieve x you're gonna listen it Works every time the key though is that you need z to actually be [00:08:15] compelling which in this case i think it is this is actually the formula use i know it's proven to work if you just do this [00:08:20] game but then you don't actually have anything at the end of the rainbow people will just churn and you're a fraud so this formula [00:08:25] Works in all types of videos it's not just short form long form and it Works everywhere else any type of content [00:08:30] in Conversation in life this is based Psychology one oh one.
Context ll [00:08:35] interjection contra now implementing this in every different video and every different usecase [00:08:40] that's what takes reps en practice that es not easy because it so hard I'm actually building a software [00:08:45] that's gonna do all this for you automatically not just the hos but the entire script you are just put in [00:08:50] the topic and i will take.
All the content frameworks and Psychology baselines that i understand [00:08:55] and we're just write the script and the ho for you to make the video compelling Sixty minutes of script writing [00:09:00] work dis still down into Sixty seconds that's what we're going for it's called sandcastles now we haven't launched it yet it's [00:09:05] coming soon the beta's gonna drop soon we have a massive wait list.
Make sure on that wait list because we're gonna have a [00:09:10] launch price that's gonna be lower than we ever offer and anyone on that wait list is gonna get it so sa Castle dot [00:09:15] ai we're gonna help with all this automated script writing en so now that we walk through the base Psychology in the [00:09:20] formula which is really important to cover off first let me go through some extra things that will really help you [00:09:25] up your hos on top of that Foundation cause i promise six and that formula is technically just [00:09:30] one so here's the other five all right the second thing is visual.
Hos i say this lot but visual [00:09:35] hos are so so so critical in the video i cannot overstate the importance visual hooks are probably [00:09:40] one hundred times more powerful than just spoken word hawks this because people read faster than [00:09:45] they can hear or they can visually comprehend a full video sin I've [00:09:50] said this on many other videos pero if you just put title text your videos will do so much better.
So step [00:09:55] one is put three to five words on the screen in a big bold font that helps build that context le if [00:10:00] you can speak it in one to two sentences can you write three to five words and [00:10:05] distill that message down a good example of this is in my video about life size floor Plans this video got like fifteen million views [00:10:10] these are called life size.
Floor Plans i use the text future of home design [00:10:15] and life size floor Plans with arrows to quickly establish the context and i used future [00:10:20] of home designs instead of life size floor Plans at the beginning because life size floor Plans is kind of the name [00:10:25] of the thing and i didn't wanna risk misunderstanding that is how critical and in detail i get with these visual [00:10:30] hooks that's how important they are now the second piece of the visual hook.
Is the visual itself you [00:10:35] want the most compelling visual possible with enough motion to hold their attention it's like when a [00:10:40] deer sees something outta the corner of their eye and their Woods they're gonna stop and they're gonna look and they're gonna see it you want that same [00:10:45] effect with your visual too much motion and you're gonna overwhelm them and it'll miss the context too little motion [00:10:50] and you're gonna bore them and they may churn you need just enough motion.
Sometimes this motion could be a girl [00:10:55] in a get ready with me putting their hair up kind of leaning forward and leaning back that sometimes is just [00:11:00] enough motion to stun the viewer into holding and watching for more this Famous Colin and Samir video [00:11:05] about the Ray band mes this has Sixty million views the reason this went so in my opinion is because [00:11:10] the initial clip has the perfect amount of rapid motion in the mirror.
That [00:11:15] motion holds en allows them to talk about the point which eventually convinces them that [00:11:20] the cool so motion is so critical in visual hook the combo of text on screen [00:11:25] plus the motion in the video plus the spoken word that combo is way more powerful than just the [00:11:30] spoken word now the third and four tips are about helping you build that common ground that i talked about [00:11:35] in the context le.
The third piece is also base Psychology it's that people like hearing things that [00:11:40] they're already interested in but they're open to hearing new perspectives on it if they think that [00:11:45] new Perspective will unlock et benefit or solve a pain point that they have in the Category [00:11:50] so if you make a video about magnesium as a supplement.
An average way to write that hook would be something [00:11:55] like you should be taking magnesium because it's one of Twenty one core building block minerals it's kind of decent but [00:12:00] it requires a previous understanding about magnesium and doesn't really talk about a benefit or pain point [00:12:05] a better context lean here would be something like if you want better sleep you need [00:12:10] to be taking magnesium.
This leads with the benefit of talking about better sleep and then [00:12:15] introduces magnesium as a potential solve even if someone is against supplements or against [00:12:20] magnesium they will likely wait and hear you out because their desire to solve the pain of not [00:12:25] sleeping well is so strong when you're riding hooks you always want to think about what the benefit or pain [00:12:30] points solve is to the target viewer and then work that in if you can now the fourth piece to [00:12:35] building the common ground is.
C and I've talked about this before when people hear something that they've heard before [00:12:40] it unlocks et comfort in their subconscious and the opposite is true it sounds weird but [00:12:45] if you hear a bunch of stuff you've never heard before you start to feel dumb and you don't like that feeling so you bounce [00:12:50] away this is why if you tried to listen to an advanced physics lecture and you've never taken a physics class you would likely [00:12:55] feel super dumb and not wanna listen to it so when you're making videos about complex or [00:13:00] niche topics you need to find a way to wrap the unknown idea.
In something that is [00:13:05] known some common layer en one way to do this is what i call this is taking [00:13:10] a known brand or a celebrity or a movement or some cultural reference and using it as [00:13:15] a metaphor or a comparison around your point por ejemplo, if you make videos about complex [00:13:20] tax planning maybe you talk about how Taylor swift's Financial advisor would plan [00:13:25] around her she just made or maybe you just reference in a group [00:13:30] when you talk about the level of Wealth that you serve.
Using these references is a really easy [00:13:35] way to establish that common ground and it's subconscious but it creates comfort for the viewer and [00:13:40] you don't need to make your full piece of content around that celebrity brand this will help you draft off [00:13:45] the credibility and the popularity of something that already exist when you are still smaller and [00:13:50] Growing tip number five is to compr speed to value.
And this is saying i use a lot especially when I'm talking about [00:13:55] short form video when you make a piece of content you should feel like you have a timer counting down in your [00:14:00] head before that content explodes and no one pays attention to it for short form that timer is about four seconds for [00:14:05] youtube videos that timer is maybe one to two minutes so you need to find a way to compress the time to [00:14:10] demonstrate initial value to before that explosion line and that applies to both [00:14:15] educational and entertainment content the best way to do this es to give a little hit of value.
Right at [00:14:20] the front in the ho or right after the hawk because you don't wanna bury your best stuff think of it like this anything you make [00:14:25] after they click off might as well be a black screen cuz they're not gonna see it you should front load the [00:14:30] value as much as possible you're not going for full completion your super fans will watch the full video you wanna front [00:14:35] load the value as much as possible to i out an extra thirty seconds at a time now i find that as long as that [00:14:40] first hit of value is Unique and helpful they will typically stay around long enough to give you a chance [00:14:45] to show your second hit of value.
That same logic that we apply with the Curiosity loop should apply [00:14:50] to this value loop give context immediate value give context immediate value front load [00:14:55] that as much as possible ideally you can inject that first hit value within the hook that's when you're really masterful [00:15:00] but if you can't do it in the hook do it right after the hook to keep them right now the sixth super [00:15:05] tactical tip is to make your.
And if you don't know what the [00:15:10] means staccato is the type of no in music that is short ta ta ta that's the now i talked about in my storytelling video [00:15:15] which a link at the end of this how it's good to vary the length of your s to create a [00:15:20] diverse rhythm and that is true for the whole video but for the hook up front.
You wanna [00:15:25] compr short s as much as you can and the reason why you do this is because shorter sense force you [00:15:30] to achieve max clarity it increases the density of value per word at the [00:15:35] beginning en when time is that a at the beginning of the video you wanna increase density value per word as [00:15:40] much as you can go shorter initially and expand to medium and longer.
As the video [00:15:45] extens right as you can tell a lot of this is just getting the reps in and continuing to iterate and learn [00:15:50] how to do this make this subconscious there are dozens of other tips that i didn have time for in this video that [00:15:55] i also try to infuse as well it's all about the reps now this takes time I've spent thousands of hours [00:16:00] doing this myself what you really need a reps and then guidance from somebody who has [00:16:05] more raps than you and this is the type of thing that i help people with in short form academy right now the academy's closed [00:16:10] but make sure if this is the thing you need help with and you're interested in.

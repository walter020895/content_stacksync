How To Become A Master Storyteller
[00:00:00] Speaker: Today we're talking about storytelling if you want your content to perform better you need to learn how to tell better [00:00:05] stories so in this video I'm gonna walk through my six favorite storytelling techniques [00:00:10] that will massively improve your content after watching this i guarantee you will think differently about the [00:00:15] way you write scripts and make videos by the way im Calloway i pulled over views on show for video [00:00:20] I've got five hundred thousand followers.
And i think about the stuff all the time right let's dive in tip number one [00:00:25] is what i call the dance all great stories are like a dance between context and [00:00:30] conflict you give a little context the characters on a mission they're doing something and then. Oh no. Here [00:00:35] comes a conflict you give a little bit more context the characters of solve that first conflict they're on their way and then [00:00:40] o no.
Another conflict this dance is how you keep the viewer lock in it could be [00:00:45] a feature film or a short form video the dance is always there conflict create. [00:00:50] Open loops in the brain context dos loops the best [00:00:55] explanation I've ever seen implement this dance idea es from Matt [00:01:00] Stone the one who created South Park they were giving a ny watch this we 
[00:01:04] Speaker 2: found[00:01:05] [00:01:10] 
me we can take these beats beat and if [00:01:15] the words and then belong between those beats.[00:01:20] 
Basically got something pretty bor what it happen between every [00:01:25] bit is the word o bat [00:01:30] right so what I'm saying this happens and [00:01:35] then this happens. No, no, no. It should be this happens and therefore this [00:01:40] happens but this happens therefore this happens and soon [00:01:45] we out. Ah [00:01:50] this but.[00:01:55] 
You get show [00:02:00] complication that 
[00:02:02] Speaker: it as simple as using the words but [00:02:05] in therefore consistently your script create dos open conflict [00:02:10] using the words. And then it'll feel like you piling on [00:02:15] and the viewer will lose interest now let's quickly take a look at one of my best Performing videos you'll notice there [00:02:20] are four but then conflict in the first thirty seconds watch this something [00:02:25] crazy happening with.[00:02:30] 
[00:02:30] Speaker 2: Six seven billion this 
[00:02:32] Speaker: forty Stanley coin has become the [00:02:35] it new releases people flipping them for [00:02:40] Stan the company ten x its revenue in four years of this [00:02:45] single es how they do it how does cups go from a construction workers [00:02:50] to the dream christmas gift. Ay. It's a [00:02:55] wild story so in Twenty nineteen Stanley was actually about to discontinue the cup but this group of mom [00:03:00] bloggers the by guided knew they were making a huge mistake so they cut a special affiliate deal with Stanley [00:03:05] to bulk order five thousand cups with a twist Stanley had to make them pas out colors those [00:03:10] five thousand cups sold out in five days and completely change their philosophy on design but [00:03:15] it gets even better a few months ago Stanley had the burning so I'm consistently setting up these heads.[00:03:20] 
To keep the storyline moving use this but then framework next time you're writing a script i guarantee it'll up level [00:03:25] that video tip number two is rhythm i talk about this a lot but there's this natural subconscious [00:03:30] pacing and rhythm that is soothing to the brain you can hear in my delivery I'm pretty decent with [00:03:35] this like natural.
E and flow the rhythm of the syll when i talk is soothing to listen [00:03:40] to now i used to be a rapper and i was a drummer Growing up so this pacing rhythm is kind of [00:03:45] embedded in me i think es why I'm Naturally good at talking in this way but i do have this [00:03:50] tactical way that can improve anyone else at rhythm take a look at this image was written by the [00:03:55] legendary author Gary prost now listen as the read this sentences five words.
[00:04:00] Here five more words five words sentences are fine but several together become monotonous listen to [00:04:05] what is happening this writing is getting boring the sound of it drones it's like a stuck record you [00:04:10] some variety now listen i varie the sentence length and i create music [00:04:15] music. The writing s it has a Pleasant rhythm a lt a Harmony i use short [00:04:20] senses and i use senses of mediumly and sometimes when I'm certain the reader is rested i will engage him [00:04:25] with a sentence of considerable length a sentence that Burns with energy and builds with all the [00:04:30] impetus of a crescendo the role of the drums the crash of the symbols sounds say listen to this it is [00:04:35] important so right with a combination of short medium and long senses create a sound that [00:04:40] pleases the Reader's ear.
Don words music y see how when all the is in the [00:04:45] same row about the same length it creates this man predictability subconsciously people [00:04:50] get turned off by this this is what makes them to the next video what you want is the use a variety of [00:04:55] CE and sy combinations to create this unpredictable rhythm if you look at [00:05:00] my script document i write every sense on a separate line if you look straight down it'll look [00:05:05] like a jagged edge and that confirms that I'm using different length sentences.
Next time you're writing [00:05:10] a script try to look for this if you see your document en all the s. Seem to end around the same point you [00:05:15] don't have enough diversity and it will feel like this es ploting lesson three is [00:05:20] to the most successful Creators en every discipline are the ones with the most conversational to it really [00:05:25] feels like you're right in the room with them Emma Chamberlain ascended to so quickly because she was [00:05:30] Naturally amazing at this case another one that's really good at this when you [00:05:35] watches videos you listen to him talk it feels like he's right in the room with you.
Now the person i learned from most about [00:05:40] this was Steve Jobs if you watch his original keynote from the first iphone launch in two [00:05:45] thousand eight he is amazing at creating this conversational room like you and him are just golf buddy shooting the [00:05:50] shit now this is very intentional and took years of practice for him to ho in he's [00:05:55] also very gifted at it by doing this Casey Steven others are able to break down that conscious [00:06:00] barrier.
Of personal identity when you watch instead of you questioning to yourself am i [00:06:05] getting sold to you get out of your own mind and just feel like you're in a Conversation like you would [00:06:10] have to answer a question that they ask you directly in a way you forget where you are and that's the magic of this [00:06:15] now I'm still working on this myself I've only been making content for like eighteen months pero if you go back to my first fifty [00:06:20] videos.
It really does feel like I'm talking à you instead of with you the best tactical way to get better [00:06:25] than this other than just a hundred raps is to right and film your videos as if [00:06:30] you're talking to one close friend if you have to just print out a picture of them and tape it on the bottom of your [00:06:35] camera so you're literally looking at them.
As you record you write your scripts make it so [00:06:40] like your typing a text or Recording an audio note directly to them over time you'll get better at this [00:06:45] conversational nature but it will feel like you're having a one on one Conversation that's how you break down this barrier [00:06:50] one of those things that inevitably you will get better over time the more you film the more you forget that the camera [00:06:55] is just the camera tip number four is direction this may seem counter intuitive but the best place to [00:07:00] start when you're writing a story is the end figure out what the end is gonna be and then work backwards from [00:07:05] there Alex called the last line of my script.
The last da because i want it to be so memorable [00:07:10] that if that's all someone heard they'd be willing to share it with a friend in short form video especially the video [00:07:15] is designed to look so the last line is actually a set up for the first line as it [00:07:20] place i think it is a lot like baseball the nine hitter is supposed to set the table for the top of the order [00:07:25] it's the exact same thing.
With the last line or two of your video when you're thinking about how to write the script [00:07:30] focus on where you wanna take the viewer what do you wanna leave them with what do you want the last thing they hear to be [00:07:35] then you can work backwards from there and build up that dance in the middle when i think about someone that does the super well it's [00:07:40] Christopher no think about his film ten inception in these are extremely complicated [00:07:45] plot lines that inevitably he had to work out the end before.
He could build up. The [00:07:50] conflict in the middle you're probably not shooting feature films but this same logic can be applied to all types of content [00:07:55] usually when I'm running scripts write the first and last line go in between create a [00:08:00] bunch of space and then I'll fill it in that's a good tactical way to try to get better at this tip number five is a concept that i call [00:08:05] story lenses and it's a way to get better at producing Unique content for social media [00:08:10] day age finding a cool topic is not enough.
Unless you're super ni down there's likely [00:08:15] dozens of other people that are talking about that same topic so how do you differentiate a story le is [00:08:20] your Unique angle or spin on a particular story imagine a beam of light the beam of lights coming across [00:08:25] the screen the Naked beam everyone looks at and sees the same thing it's like this white beam of light as soon as you [00:08:30] put a Lens.
Or in front of the light what people see will look differently than the main be [00:08:35] think of that prism or that Lens as your story ls it's your Unique [00:08:40] fingerprint en how you uniquely tell the story about that topic let's take an example when Taylor swift [00:08:45] went to the super bowl the most common lenses would've been to talk about what she's wearing o when she's getting there [00:08:50] or what her facial reaction is to something a lot of people covered those exact same stories a [00:08:55] less common Lens will be to talk about a prediction for what you think might happen.
Les people would have that but [00:09:00] an even less common Lens would be to talk about the business impact that she was driving on the [00:09:05] NFL for being at the game that's the Lens that i chose to take because i thought i could be a Category of one that's why [00:09:10] i ultimately made this video and i pulled a million views it was different my story ls was something Unique [00:09:15] the people hadn't seen before the last tip number six is the hook i love this for last because.
Everybody [00:09:20] always talks about the hawk first and it makes sense it is very important if people on the the rest of [00:09:25] what i talked about doesn't really matter so I've got two ways to level up your ho the first is that your first line should [00:09:30] be as punchy and as indicative of the plot as possible hit the video is about your best garden [00:09:35] techniques the should be some the this is the best garden techniques for x.
Or I've got [00:09:40] these garden techniques or this thing is a garden technique that you should study you shouldn't your with [00:09:45] open op line wait til you see this or you're never gonna believe this because if the first line doesn't [00:09:50] immediately grab the view show video your dad the second point on hawks that's extremely powerful and something i [00:09:55] overlooked for a long time is that visual hooks times [00:10:00] more effective.
Then audio only what is Smith when you're on the screen and you're saying something but the only thing that [00:10:05] you work can see is your mouth moving and maybe the caption dancing that's gonna be way less effective than if you [00:10:10] put a visual on the screen for them to look and react to because people's eyes perceive [00:10:15] faster than their ear can hear so you wanna compliment what you're saying.
[00:10:20] With a visual on the screen this is a visual hook somebody that's really good at this is my friend Kevin from epic garden if you [00:10:25] watch his videos he immediately shows a visual that confirms what he's talking about [00:10:30] like this one about strawberries before i hear anything he says i see a Strawberry on the screen it's vivid red [00:10:35] immediately i know this video is gonna be about strawberries if i like strawberries I'm gonna stick around to see what he's saying [00:10:40] now I've started testing this and I've noticed the visual hook aspect has been super helpful à [00:10:45] retaining viewers so in summary when you're thinking about your hook get to the point.
And show you [00:10:50] that's it for this one if you like this video and got value from it i host the free community for people that trying to level [00:10:55] content cre entrepreneurs it is called wave world I've got all types of videos like this [00:11:00] hard pick content topics editing tips how to create formats in series if you need content [00:11:05] to help improve your business or build your personal brand you should be in there completely free in the meantime keep me posted on [00:11:10] what you thought this video and we see Guys on the next one peace.

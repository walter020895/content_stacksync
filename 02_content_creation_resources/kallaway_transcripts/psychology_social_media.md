If You Don't Understand Psychology, You Don't Understand Social Media
[00:00:00] Speaker: If you want your content to perform better all you have to understand is human pology this is [00:00:05] the number one thing that separates the great Creators from everyone else and if you can learn this one thing [00:00:10] theres absolutely zero chance you will fail in the content game so en this video I'm gonna walk through [00:00:15] exactly how to use pology to hack of yours brain into watching your [00:00:20] videos it mean Psychology principles when it comes to content I'm gonna break down each one how [00:00:25] it Works why it Works and the exact tactics for how you can use it.
For yourself by the way if you don't know me [00:00:30] I'm Calloway i have a million followers I've done billions of use and if there's one thing that helped me grow [00:00:35] super fast on both social media and youtube it's understanding Psychology right now the [00:00:40] first Psychology principle is called desire mapping and this really is the foundational piece [00:00:45] for how all of human Psychology.
Works every human has base desires [00:00:50] typically these desires map back to money time health en status i call these the [00:00:55] four horseman ofs typically this is the root of what everyone wants human Behavior [00:01:00] is wire to make you take actions that unlock those desires por ejemplo, if i want [00:01:05] more money I'm gonna figure out what actions i need to take so i can make more money this is how [00:01:10] base human Behavior Works.
No the main actions a human can take to unlock those desires or [00:01:15] spend time or spend money dos are de two main ins so really most human Behavior [00:01:20] bo to this spending time money to to get more time [00:01:25] more money more health more status nada pretty but that fundamental equation es [00:01:30] critical to understanding exactly how human Behavior really Works okay, so what [00:01:35] does all this have to do with getting people to watch your content when if you are watches something they're paying with their [00:01:40] time.
This video es free so it doesn't cost any dollars you're paying with your time and attention so the [00:01:45] question really es why do you ever spend any time watching any educational content [00:01:50] and the answer is you do it because you believe that time Investment will help you unlock one of [00:01:55] those four desires the truth is you are watching this video right now because you believe it will [00:02:00] help you learn how to get more views on your content and if you do that you grow following.
And if [00:02:05] you go following you'll eventually unlock influence and make more money that is why you're watching when [00:02:10] you realize it consciously or not and this really is the Psychology secret for why anyone [00:02:15] watches any educational content ever they believe that time in will eventually equal [00:02:20] skills and desires out because i know this is how your brain Works i engineer [00:02:25] the the intro the storytelling.
To specifically trigger that [00:02:30] desire loop in other words I've manipulated you into watching because i already know what you want [00:02:35] and that is desire mapping i figured out what you desire and then frame my content [00:02:40] in the Optimal way so that it makes you opt in to thinking it will help you get it and that's [00:02:45] the big Psychology trick happening in content especially with anything that's educational.
All you have to do is [00:02:50] get someone to trust that if they keep watching they will get closer to their [00:02:55] heres where all breaks as soon as they feel spending more time watching will not get them closer they're [00:03:00] gonna bounce i it's not that they get bored its that they lose trust that the rest of the video [00:03:05] es actually going to help them.
So in that spirit the rest of this video I'm gonna walk through seven more Psychology [00:03:10] tactics that will get viewers to trust your content will help unlock theirs because if [00:03:15] you can get them to trust that they will be watching Forever the second Psychology tactic es called [00:03:20] the light bulb effect and here the more someone understands what you're saying the faster [00:03:25] they will trust you and this because when people understand things they feel smart when they feel [00:03:30] smart they also think you are smart because you are the one that feel way.
It turns out people [00:03:35] hate feeling dumb and they don't trust people that they can't understand and so for you in your [00:03:40] content if you're trying to maximize speed to trust you need to increase the viewer's absorption [00:03:45] rate of the word you're saying literally what percentage of the words you say does the [00:03:50] viewer actually understand and comprehend.
The higher the smart and the trust you [00:03:55] here's why i call this the lightbulb effect the faster you can get a viewer to think. Ah, i get it now [00:04:00] that makes so much sense the sooner they will trust you en keep watching because they'll want to feel more [00:04:05] ofb moments and as soon as you can get them de two lightbulb moments in the video you got [00:04:10] them hotline Forever now tactically here the four things you need to do in your content to make [00:04:15] those lightbulb moments happen sooner first talk at la fifth grade reading level.
No [00:04:20] big words short simple sentences simple phrasing don't overcomplicated unnecessarily and i [00:04:25] say this all the time my videos when I'm talking about clarity in comprehension because this really is the [00:04:30] most important thing if they can't understand your words then they can't understand the meaning and so they won't [00:04:35] extract what you're trying to teach.
Right second talk in comparisons you wanna [00:04:40] relate the new thing you're talking about to an existing thing they already understand this will make it way easier [00:04:45] for them to comprehend what you're saying because of a relative understanding you ever wondered why those avers [00:04:50] b. Body building ads with the pre and post always Works so well it's because everybody already [00:04:55] understands what.
A feels like that's what they're living today so when you show a speed they don't need to [00:05:00] dream up what a feels like they know and so b is the future that they want I'm telling [00:05:05] you relative understanding is a chico for explaining anything third remove all the fluff [00:05:10] in the intro and beginning so you can reduce the time to a you don't get extra points for [00:05:15] being the one with the most details so cut everything that does not matter.
And for use [00:05:20] visuals to support the word you're saying all these graphics we make we do this for a reason it's so that [00:05:25] they can help improve your understanding of the words as i say them words by themselves are very hard to [00:05:30] comprehend in a long piece of content the brain can only absorb so many words at 11 but words [00:05:35] plus visuals are way easier to digest for much longer just remember this it's not sexy [00:05:40] but clarity is the ultimate Psychology hack because it means the viewer actually understands the word you're [00:05:45] saying.
Enough to be influenced by the Psychology hack number three is called [00:05:50] emulation i also call this one the mirroring effect and here people trust you faster when you [00:05:55] look dress sound and act like the person that they want to become en other words they [00:06:00] wanna emulate your exact action path so that they can become a version of you now [00:06:05] emulation is a subconscious psychological trigger but it's really effective at getting someone to trust you and watch [00:06:10] for longer and I'll admit it seems kind of silly to think your visual representation.
[00:06:15] Matters more than the world you actually saying but you be shocked how influential this can be and here's why when [00:06:20] someone sees you they take in everything they can see and instantly form a snap judgment of [00:06:25] who you are and if they want to be like you now if they don't wanna be like you or don't really like your [00:06:30] vibe they'll put a much more filter on the information you share almost looking for a [00:06:35] reason to turn or stop watching but if they do wanna be like you they will give you a much longer leash of [00:06:40] attention.
Essentially the bar for them to turn your content es much much lower and this is because [00:06:45] your visual presentation or visual vibe signals who you and it often Gives off a [00:06:50] representation that your methods or teachings have been effective for example if you have a super crisp [00:06:55] camera and a really clean set up it signals that you care enough about this to invest the money [00:07:00] in up the quality and you on if you're wearing a fifty thousand rolex in the [00:07:05] video it signals that you've been successful in some way shape or form.
It's visual proof in a [00:07:10] way so tactically it can be extremely helpful to look dress sound and act like the end [00:07:15] state of what your ideal viewer ideal customer wants to be and it's simple if [00:07:20] your target audience is aspiring designers then you wanna look like what an aspiring Designer wants to [00:07:25] be ten or Twenty years in the future in this example i think of my friend oren who is targeting designers and i think of what [00:07:30] he wears and how his set looks on his videos and it maps perfect to this visual [00:07:35] athetic or vibe.
Now if you make content about crypto you need to look and act [00:07:40] and talk the way someone that was in deep crypto would look so don't shower sit in the dark don't make eye contact with [00:07:45] the camera I'm just kidding that was a joke one joke por video that was a pretty one i will say one thing when it [00:07:50] comes to building this visual persona one word of caution i recommend that instead of playing a [00:07:55] character that is not representative of who you action.
Le your true self really all the way [00:08:00] the things that actually represent you because if you play a character that you have to lie to [00:08:05] embody eventually it will come back to bite you when you can't keep up the the point is it can be an [00:08:10] extremely helpful exercise to map out what the visual representation of the end [00:08:15] state for your audience wants to be em characteristics in your [00:08:20] can like what you wear how you act how you talk the brand you reference the [00:08:25] slang you use.
It all helps influence subconscious likability and will [00:08:30] send trust signals to people that want to be like that also before i go on if you wanna learn more about Psychology and how [00:08:35] to use it in content so you can grow faster on social media and youtube you should definitely join wavy world it's [00:08:40] a completely free community that i build specifically for business owners and entrepreneurs trying to improve [00:08:45] their content there's a bunch of other video lessons in there on Psychology as well as all the other [00:08:50] pieces of the content stack ideas strategy tools everything.
Theres thirty six [00:08:55] thousand other entrepreneurs in there and it's completely free I've gotta link in the description if you wanna join right the next Psychology trick [00:09:00] that really holds attention is called personalization the more you make it feel like your content is [00:09:05] personalized to the viewer the more they're gonna trust that it will solve their specific problem no why is [00:09:10] this the case people trust generic Solutions less because they realize they're gonna have to both learn the information [00:09:15] and translate for their specific use case.
Personalized Solutions [00:09:20] for them are ready to go off the shelf they're already skinned for the usecase you have for example let's say [00:09:25] i ran a marketing agency and i was making content about social media Growth if my advice in the content was [00:09:30] generic and Surface level then a clothing brand Founder would have to both learn the [00:09:35] tactics and try to figure out what exactly applies for him this is much less compelling than if i [00:09:40] were to make a video saying.
Heres how to grow en social media if you're a clothing brand obviously this advice to [00:09:45] go more personal and more specific sounds intuitive if you're optimizing for max [00:09:50] views because the more specific you get with your content the fewer people it's gonna apply to and the less views you'll [00:09:55] get but if you're running a business it isn't really about pure views [00:10:00] it's about on target views.
From your target so my suggestion here would be to experiment with [00:10:05] much more personalized and targeted content and be willing to trade off pure views [00:10:10] in Exchange for precision targeting to do this you can start packaging or intro in your [00:10:15] videos specifically by calling out the group that you're making it for for example if you're building a [00:10:20] clothing brand here three social media Growth strategies you should study or these are the best three [00:10:25] clothing Brands Growing on social media right now.
Because i hear time and time again from business owners that they're [00:10:30] getting views on their content but it's not converting into actual customers and this is because when you make broad [00:10:35] content optimize for max views most of the viewers are not in your [00:10:40] avatar now another way to infuse personalization into your content that is a lot less limiting es to use [00:10:45] the words you and your as much as you possibly can.
When someone hears the word you in the content [00:10:50] it feels like you're talking directly to them and this has a subconscious psychological effect that the [00:10:55] content is more personalized for them so the guidance really is this think about who your [00:11:00] ideal buyer is and personalize your content so it speaks directly to them.
And this [00:11:05] will drive total views down but it will bring on target views up which will increase overall trust [00:11:10] with the people watching the next Psychology hack is pretty obvious but it matters so much it's worth [00:11:15] going over and that is proof and hit rate people will trust you way faster if you [00:11:20] actually have proof that what you're talking about has worked for someone like them and no trust you [00:11:25] even faster if you have a high hit rate with proof across multiple different types of customers.[00:11:30] 
Over and over na es this outside proof is the ultimate signal your [00:11:35] knowledge Works regardless of who because the truth is most viewers will stop [00:11:40] watching 11 they get the feeling the information is too custom for them to be able to implement [00:11:45] themselves if you of proof that this is already worked for somebody else especially if that person [00:11:50] seems like them well they're gonna stay because they expect you to be able to explain it in a way they can use i cannot [00:11:55] overstate how critical it is.
To signal this proof as early as possible in the [00:12:00] video now you have two ways to communicate proof direct and indirect if you actually have proof [00:12:05] yourself you should say it esa this is direct so for example when i make videos i always say in the [00:12:10] intro by the way I'm Calloway i have a million followers i done billions of views and content is all i do all day long i say [00:12:15] that every single time.
And sometimes i even add I've helped hundreds of business owners solve their content [00:12:20] problems or some version of that this is me signaling that i have tons of proof myself and that my [00:12:25] lessons have worked for literally hundreds of others just like the people watching but what do you do if you [00:12:30] don't have direct proof yet you're more of a beginner and you haven't yet established direct proof.
The [00:12:35] indirect proof way would be the piggyback off of someone that does have direct proof so instead of saying [00:12:40] these are the six bests and then making someone guess if they can trust you or not you could say something like [00:12:45] I've studied Calloway he has a million followers and a billion views and these are the six best hooks that he says [00:12:50] work amazingly and then you can break down what i say with your own Perspective what you've done here [00:12:55] is offloaded some of the proof requirement.
Onto my personal brand so that you don't have to carry the [00:13:00] full proof yourself obviously this is gonna be less effective than direct proof because some of the [00:13:05] credit's gonna go to me and the viewer's eyes but this is a great way to get some proof [00:13:10] rather than none if there's one thing you can do to get people to trust you faster it's proof this is why every company [00:13:15] in the world has case Studies public Metrics and testimonials all over their site proof es the [00:13:20] easiest way to build Instant trust the next Psychology hack to use in your content is familiar.[00:13:25] 
En this builds on the point before indirect proof people will trust your content more if you show [00:13:30] faces or visuals that they already recognize this is why you see smaller channels on youtube [00:13:35] use Famous Creators or entrepreneurs faces Inna this is why you see unknow [00:13:40] Creators using Famous names in their titles this is why you see visuals of people in the [00:13:45] intro of most videos we even used.
Famous Creators entrepreneurs in our intros and we do it because [00:13:50] giving viewers something they're already familiar with and recognize is a chi code in getting them to trust [00:13:55] you faster and here's why this Works from a Psychology Perspective the brain is a pattern [00:14:00] matching machine it releases dopamine when it see something it recognize so when you show someone something [00:14:05] they've already seen before they that recognition and the implicitly trust [00:14:10] goes back to both the clarity point and the proof.
They're gonna get more clarity when you show [00:14:15] them visuals of something they already recognize so they'll understand the point you're making more and they're gonna trust you faster [00:14:20] because they're gonna associate some Portion of that point to the Expert that they already know [00:14:25] when you are small relatively unknow the most important thing is to find points of familiarity.
[00:14:30] So you can build common ground of trust with the viewer and over time as you get more credible that's when you start [00:14:35] infusing the visuals of yourself right Psychology tip number seven really is my secret weapon [00:14:40] this is the thing i figured out that really moves the Needle when it comes to speed to trust and i call it one [00:14:45] standard deviation the key with content is getting a viewer to opt in that they actually have [00:14:50] some pain point or blocker without their bs detector going off because if you come right out in [00:14:55] the intro o the title o the thumbnail and you say if you wanna make more money do this.
It often [00:15:00] triggers their bs detector and they dismiss you immediately and this happens because viewers [00:15:05] hear that if you want more money and they think it really can't be that easy so there must be some snake oil thing [00:15:10] going on and they dismiss it and this is all happening subconsciously in their mind because of Psychology they've [00:15:15] been trained to see so many of these internet scams that the warning bells go off when something seems too good [00:15:20] to be true.
Now 11 that bs detector is tripped like a bank Rob tripping the wire [00:15:25] it's over they don't trust you they're gonna bounce and they're never gonna come back so this is where the one standard [00:15:30] deviation tactic comes in when you're either packaging your video writing the intro or getting into the [00:15:35] story now i call it one standard deviation because sometimes it can be easier.
To [00:15:40] package your content one standard deviation away from the desire person actually wants and let [00:15:45] them make the lip themselves so for example let's take a piece of content about Growing on [00:15:50] social media most people wanna grow on social media because they think it'll make them more money they don't actually wanna spend forty [00:15:55] hours per week make videos they just want more money that's the desire their but the beauty most [00:16:00] people already believe that if they grow on social media.
They will make money they think of it as the same [00:16:05] thing it's a proxy so if it target with my they're not Growing their social [00:16:10] channels fast enough and that they are faster ways they will associate with the money [00:16:15] they want and when they hear not Growing faster on social media they make the l [00:16:20] and opt in it doesn't trigger the bs detector and to prove this is so effective if you look at my videos [00:16:25] any time a reference money.
The videos just don't do that well and i think this is what's [00:16:30] happening subconsciously but Anytime i reference a specific very clear content pain point that [00:16:35] is a proxy for Growing on social media which will lead to money the videos always crush [00:16:40] and this isn't an accident it's just Psychology people are tripping the red wire when you talk about the desire [00:16:45] directly but if you go one Devi away they want so the specific tactic is this [00:16:50] figure out which of the your targeting.
And then go one standard deviation away [00:16:55] to package your content and make topics about things that are proxy [00:17:00] for those desires in the viewers mind that's all I've got for this video as a recap we covered eight [00:17:05] Psychology tactics to help you build trust with viewers faster so that they watch your [00:17:10] content for and when they trust you and believe your content will help.
They're gonna keep [00:17:15] watching for a long time as a reminder if you're a business owner and you're trying to get better at content and you like the [00:17:20] way i explain things you should join wavey world it's completely free and we have over thirty six [00:17:25] thousand other entrepreneurs that are all working together to help each other if you wanna do that there's a link in the descripción where you [00:17:30] can join right we will see you Guys on the next one piece.

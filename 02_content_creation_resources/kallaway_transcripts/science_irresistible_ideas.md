The Science-Based Method To Create Irresistible Ideas
[00:00:00] Kallaway: Today we're talking about ideas if you want your videos to perform better you have to improve your idea [00:00:05] process this is the most important aspect of content nothing else matters if the idea [00:00:10] es we no here's the truth about ideas that may surprise you the top Creators you look up to they're all [00:00:15] using the exact same process to find and develop.
Their ideas they've all built [00:00:20] an idea mining system and that really is the secret for how they're Growing so fast [00:00:25] their ideas are just better so en this video I'm gonna walk through the step by step process for how you can build [00:00:30] the exact same idea mining system for yourself. [00:00:35] It's just three steps and if you do this i guarantee your videos will perform better i know this Works because content is all i do all day [00:00:40] long i have a million followers I've done billions of views and my idea mining [00:00:45] system is the reason i can go viral whenever i want before i break down the process on how to build the [00:00:50] idea mining system.
Let's just get Crystal clear on what a video idea actually is cuz [00:00:55] it's probably not what you think most people think the video idea is just the topic but that's only [00:01:00] one small piece of it a video idea es made up of seven different components i call these [00:01:05] idea legos you have the topic but you also have the angle the hook the story [00:01:10] structure the visual format.
The key visuals and the audio think of these seven [00:01:15] different components as lego Bricks that asemble together to create a Unique video a día no [00:01:20] let's just define each of these seven pieces very quickly so you know exactly what I'm talking about the topic is the [00:01:25] one sentence simple description of what the video is about but the angle is the combination of the [00:01:30] premise take an interesting key facts that used to explain the topic so you [00:01:35] could have two branding videos about Apple one of them about the history of their logo design.
[00:01:40] And the other one about a specific ad campaign from two thousand four these are very different videos [00:01:45] similar topic completely different angles ok lets keep going the hook structure es made up of three [00:01:50] parts the spoken hook what is said the text hook the text that is shown on screen [00:01:55] and the visual hook.
What is shown and how it's shown the story structure is the way the story is [00:02:00] delivered could be a breakdown a listical a tutorial think of it like story blocks or an outline [00:02:05] structure that determines how the story flows the visual format is the way the video is [00:02:10] laid out visually could be green screen could be a PV vlog could be a faceless music only [00:02:15] text Conversation there are dozens and dozens of winning visual formats but just think of this like the visual [00:02:20] layout of the video then we have the key visuals which are the actual visuals used in the layout.[00:02:25] 
It's what's actually shown on screen the a roll the b roll the animations et CET the [00:02:30] visual format is how the visuals are laid out and sequenced the key visuals are the visuals themselves and [00:02:35] then lastly you have audio which is either the background music or sound Effects now every video [00:02:40] is a combination of these seven lego breaks and this is really important because knowing this and [00:02:45] thinking in these lego brick terms will completely change the way you find and develop video [00:02:50] ideas so as we build the system for finding better ideas just keep those seven lego Bricks in mind.
[00:02:55] We'll come back to those in a second. Okay, now let's get to the good stuff this is the three step system for coming up with [00:03:00] better content ideas so that you get more views and grow faster on social media step one [00:03:05] es called outlier research the first step in the process is to find other videos in your niche that [00:03:10] have already performed well.
We call these out we measure them using out score [00:03:15] an out takes the views of one video divided by the average views of that channel so [00:03:20] for example if some video gets a hundred thousand views and the average views on that channel is around ten thousand [00:03:25] that would be an out score of ten x now out scoring is important because it helps us compare [00:03:30] different size channels apples de apples.
Small channels typically don't get as many views on [00:03:35] average but if they have a banger video with a fifty x outlier then that signals something different [00:03:40] happened there that's worth studying so Outliers are the court everything we do when it comes to i research [00:03:45] and it makes sense right if i showed you a hundred videos and said.
I'll give you a million dollars if you can [00:03:50] make one that beats all one hundred what would you do well the first thing is you would Rank the from best worst and you would study [00:03:55] the best one you look for gaps identify whatever week and then try to make your version [00:04:00] better than the weak points of the best videos por dos best examples are called out [00:04:05] out now I'm gonna explain exactly where and how to find out.
Just know [00:04:10] step one in the process is that you need to build a system for finding Outliers en your [00:04:15] niche. Okay, here step two 11 you find an outlier you need to Analyze it across those [00:04:20] seven lego breaks and your goal is to find common patterns across the winners maybe you notice that [00:04:25] six at the top ten Performing videos in your niche are all talking about the same topic or maybe when you zoom [00:04:30] out and Analyze the top fifty best performers you keep seeing the same visual [00:04:35] format that grabs your attention over and over.
These patterns are indicating there is a proven answer for that [00:04:40] lego break in your niche that insight is gold because what you're really doing when you [00:04:45] Analyze the patterns is letting the data tell you what Works best see if you've ever tried [00:04:50] to make content before and it hasn't worked well then the number one question on your mind is why isn't it working and the reason why [00:04:55] it isn't working is because you are guessing at what might work across all seven [00:05:00] of those lago breaks.
You probably came up with an unvalidated topic had a random take tried some [00:05:05] story structure or hook structure that was unvalidated with a visual format that you had never seen before et [00:05:10] cetera you weren't using data you were using your gut using data makes it much easier to win faster [00:05:15] because humans cannot outrun their Psychology they tend to behave the same way over and over [00:05:20] if the research is saying one lego break Works best for your niche in a certain way.
It's probably gonna [00:05:25] keep working well in that way over and over now am i saying you shouldn't ever try to be creative and [00:05:30] experiment with something that's never been done no of course not you should but just know your hit rate is gonna be way lower [00:05:35] if you make ten reps based on validated data you're gonna get more winners than ten reps based on [00:05:40] your gut it's just a fact so if you wanna grow faster on social media trust me you need an idea [00:05:45] research process based on finding Outliers in your niche okay, so far we've covered two of the [00:05:50] three steps in the idea mining system.
First you need to look for Outliers [00:05:55] in your niche second 11 you find those Outliers you need to figure out what those seven ideal lego [00:06:00] breaks were for that video what is the topic what is the format how is the hot made you're [00:06:05] looking for patterns that signal what is already working now here's the third and final step 11 you [00:06:10] identify winning patterns in the ideal lego breaks you wanna hold the winning components constant.
And [00:06:15] remix rest so for example let's say we make fitness content and we notice that all the best Performing videos are [00:06:20] hooking in the same way and using the same couple visual formats we'll take those two [00:06:25] components keep them the same but then we will change the topic the angle the story [00:06:30] structure the key visuals the audio so in this case it hold two remix five i like to think of this process [00:06:35] kind of like playing five card poker you see some reference outlier you break it into seven [00:06:40] cards you pick which cards to keep and then you reshuffle the rest to get a new set of seven.
This makes a new [00:06:45] combination which is a higher chance of outperforming the original cuz you kept the good parts and you [00:06:50] fixed the bad now this process i just described it's called idea mining and it's the most important step in the entire [00:06:55] content workflow ideas are the thing that differentia the winners and losers on social media and youtube.[00:07:00] 
This mining process es what all the top Creators and Brands are doing and it's why they have an edge [00:07:05] over you they're using the data to tell them where the fish now not to rain on the Parade but here [00:07:10] is what makes this idea research process so difficult the patterns for what Works in each lago [00:07:15] break changes over time and the winning combination.
Is completely different from niche to niche [00:07:20] what Works for the fitness niche won't always work for the makeup niche which is not always gonna work for the marketing [00:07:25] niche and so on for some niches certain hook styles always work for other niches certain formats always [00:07:30] work for other niches it's not clear what the pattern is.
There is no one size fits all strategy [00:07:35] that applies to all businesses across every niche it is a completely blank SL [00:07:40] from Category to Category that's why learning how to do this idea research process is so critical [00:07:45] it's probably the most valuable content Skill you could develop en fact it's so valuable [00:07:50] that if you train yourself on becoming really good at this.
You could probably start a seven figure [00:07:55] revenue per year solo agency where you just did this for top Creators and Brands [00:08:00] because regardless of the niche if you get good at identifying the patterns you can't lose. Ok, so now that [00:08:05] we're clear on what a video idea actually is and the three step strategy for how to build an idea mining system.[00:08:10] 
Let's get tactical because what kind of channel would this be if i didn't also just give you [00:08:15] the step by step click for click exact tactical process for how to do what i just described [00:08:20] so let's dive into it first I'm gonna explain exactly where to find the best [00:08:25] outlier ideas for your niche then I'm gonna share my screen and I'm gonna show you exactly how i [00:08:30] run this idea mining process.
A hundred times faster than everybody else. Okay, so first where do we find out videos [00:08:35] they are four main places you can look for out ideas we've got a two two matrix let's say [00:08:40] you make Instagram reals about fitness content so that means you create short form videos on [00:08:45] Instagram short form videos is the content type Instagram is the content platform your goal is to find [00:08:50] Outliers of fitness content.
You can study to make better Instagram real that [00:08:55] so you could look for outs four places same type same platform would be other fitness related short form [00:09:00] videos on Instagram that's what you're making and where you are same type different platform [00:09:05] would be other fitness related short form videos but on tiktok youtube linkedin Facebook any [00:09:10] other platform except for Instagram now different types same platform would be other fitness related posts on [00:09:15] Instagram.
But it be static images or stories anything except for short form video and then lastly [00:09:20] different type different platform would be other fitness related posts but maybe it's tweets or blogs or [00:09:25] youtube videos it's nons shortform video and it's non Instagram now of those four boxes [00:09:30] which places do you think are gonna be the best source of continuous inspiration that you can use for [00:09:35] fitness related short form ig reals to these boxes are the golden ge for where you should look.[00:09:40] 
Pause the video and think about it for ok i the it's the top two boxes [00:09:45] same content type on the same platform or different platforms that's where you [00:09:50] should look for outlier ideas this is gonna be the rule the best place to look for out ideas is gonna be the same [00:09:55] content type in case short video and either the same platform Instagram real.
[00:10:00] Or other platforms that support that content type tiktok youtube et cetera and why es this [00:10:05] because humans tend to behave the same over and over like i said they cannot outrun their Psychology vertical video [00:10:10] content hits people differently than other types of content the consumption patterns are just [00:10:15] different type de type so the easiest fo proof path to find winning out is to hold the type [00:10:20] constant find other fitness related.
Short form videos wherever you can and mind [00:10:25] them for patterns now if you really know what you're doing with content you can find interesting idea seeds [00:10:30] on other content types tweets blogs youtube but if you do this and find the topic and even the [00:10:35] angle you're then playing from scratch on all the other lego breaks the hook won carry over the [00:10:40] story structure won't carry over.
The format won't carry over et cetera this will not be one to one [00:10:45] from a tweet to a video and so you won't be able to just transport you're gonna have to crack the full code [00:10:50] en your own this is very hard for people to do consistently unless they're experts at content so if you want the [00:10:55] easy path the easiest mode the path that all these Brands are doing.
Just look for the same [00:11:00] content type on the same platform o different platforms because the goal when you're making content especially [00:11:05] as a business or business owner is to the risk your effort every rep you want the highest [00:11:10] chance that your effort is actually gonna pay off that the video's actually gonna work if you wanna increase your ad [00:11:15] significantly just narrow your research focus to the things that working in the same [00:11:20] format making.
Okay now before i get to the real sauce and breakdown my process for doing this a hundred times faster let's [00:11:25] just recap on where we've been so far just to set the table everyone can be even first we broke [00:11:30] down that every video idea es really seven different idea lego breaks next we [00:11:35] explain that the way to figure out what the winning patterns are across those seven lego breaks es to find Outliers [00:11:40] in your niche and Analyze them we then established that the best place to find those outlier videos in [00:11:45] your niche or on the same different platforms.
Using the same content type so in this [00:11:50] era short form video es king for social media if you wanna go on social media be making short form video [00:11:55] and that means you should be looking for Outliers on Instagram to en youtube. Ok, so at this point we are clear we need to [00:12:00] look for Outliers on dos platforms so now the big question is what es the actual process for [00:12:05] doing this outlier research because you can't really expect to just scro the feed for two [00:12:10] hours out comme well the crazy thing.
Yes that is the process that [00:12:15] everyone has been running this whole time they cur try to have those Outliers serve up [00:12:20] automatically or they have a list of inspiration accounts that they manually open scroll through and [00:12:25] try to find the Outliers that process takes Forever the good news es i [00:12:30] have a much better we basically a shortcut for all that manual work that makes it a hundred times faster and that shortcut [00:12:35] is using sand castles dot ai sand castles is the only tool in the world that makes this idea [00:12:40] mining process extremely easy.
By the way if you tried the original version of San castles that was just for script writing this [00:12:45] is a completely different thing here's how San castles Works and why it's so cracked for idea mining first you build a watch [00:12:50] list of the top channels in your niche and this is so you can narrow in your outlier search to just the accounts [00:12:55] that you already know are crushing.
En San castles you can use the channel tab to search for any cre [00:13:00] just drop in their handle or the ur prof. And you can add any account from Instagram tiktok or [00:13:05] youtube there are thousands of Creators already in San castles those are gonna pop up but if we don't have [00:13:10] somebody you want just search for their press a new channel and we get them in there en fifteen minutes now there's no limit [00:13:15] on the amount of channels you can add ou the amount of les you can make un power.
What you [00:13:20] wanna do is build out a list for your corn niche and then if you want you can build out separate lists for adjacent [00:13:25] niches so if you make fitness content make a watch list name it fitness and add Twenty to thirty [00:13:30] of the top fitness Creators that you know are already crushing now here's a very common question how do i figure out [00:13:35] which channels i should be looking at for inspiration i understand how to do it in San Castle but how [00:13:40] do i actually know which ones to add in the first place and this is a great question.
The four ways to find the best [00:13:45] inspiration channels when you're doing research the first way is that you already have a list of accounts [00:13:50] some Excel list you know make the best content for your space and if you have that list problem [00:13:55] is obviously solved just start adding that list in the second way is you might not have a full list but there's [00:14:00] probably at least one person that you can think of that really content your space star with [00:14:05] that person open on Instagram click who they're following.
And then you can see [00:14:10] a list of the people that they follow typically if someone is legit in a space they're [00:14:15] also following the other legit people in a space so that shortens the list go through that list [00:14:20] anyone thats relevant copy prof. Them to the third way is to search on Instagram tiktok [00:14:25] o youtube search for topics or keywords that will be relevant for your niche when you do that the top [00:14:30] video click on the video the and then.
You can start with [00:14:35] them and run path two that i just mentioned go to who they're following and look through that list and the last [00:14:40] way to find relevant accounts to add to watch les in sandcastles es go to the video tab in sand castles clear [00:14:45] all the filters and then search by top key word or database is all the top Creators across [00:14:50] every niche so the videos that show.
Click on the Creator who made them and add that person to a list so [00:14:55] there are four ways right there to find the top account in your niche add to a watch list in [00:15:00] regardless of the path you take all roads lead to curating a list of the top [00:15:05] accounts in your space take the ten to fifteen minutes and do this it'll make everything so much easier.
All right now [00:15:10] is where things get really interesting 11 you have that watch list built out go to the videos tab and filter [00:15:15] the videos for just that watch list what you then have is a feed of videos [00:15:20] posted only from the accounts in your list and if the hair on the back of your neck is not standing up as you see this.[00:15:25] 
It should be because this is an absolute chi code for finding out videos you can take this [00:15:30] database of videos and now you can sort by outlier score o posted date and filter by [00:15:35] a bunch of different key Metrics so for example let's say i wanted to make content about social media marketing. [00:15:40] Maybe i run a social media agency or I'm trying to build a personal brand around content marketing here's [00:15:45] the list that I've already made with the top Twenty channels that talk about this stuff on Instagram and [00:15:50] tiktok I've already built it up so i go to the videos tab i filter by that list now if i wanna see the best Performing [00:15:55] videos in the social media marketing space posted in the last three months from my list sorted [00:16:00] best worst all the outlier you need surf up [00:16:05] Silver plat.
It is insane how easy San Castle makes this compared to the manual way everybody was doing [00:16:10] it now you can Analyze these videos in this card view so you can see the thumbnail or in like a [00:16:15] table view a little bit more minimal if that's what you prefer if you wanna just copy my filter settings these the best settings for making sure the [00:16:20] Outliers are relevant every single time first for out score you wanna filter five x and above for [00:16:25] engagement rate you wanna go point five percent and above this will screen out all the paid brand deals there.[00:16:30] 
Juice but actually not Outliers for postdate you wanna play with seven days fourteen days one month [00:16:35] three months six months twelve if you're making news base content where relevancy and recency [00:16:40] matters seven days fourteen days is the best if you make Evergreen content three months six months even twelve [00:16:45] months might Surface interesting ideas that are still relevant and then you wanna sort using those two [00:16:50] arrows in the.
By outlier score descending that's the easiest way to get the top Performing [00:16:55] videos at the top and you can create a filter preset with all these just press that save button it'll save a [00:17:00] preset for you so you can one click get this every single time now obviously new videos are being posted by these Creators every single day [00:17:05] and we're ingesting them Daily so.
You really wanna be in San Castle every day or at least four to five times [00:17:10] a week so you're constantly seeing the latest Outliers now from here the process is to start [00:17:15] analyzing those individual outlier videos across the seven idea lego breaks and [00:17:20] you can do that in two different ways the first way is you can just click play video on any of the cards or the and it will [00:17:25] open the video up so you can just watch it manually the second way is that you can click.
Video and [00:17:30] see the idea detail page and here you get a bunch of Metrics on the video the full transcript [00:17:35] as well as detailed Analysis on the hot structure and the story structure now here's my personal process [00:17:40] for how i go about using this i like to use both of those methods combine so first i will open the [00:17:45] video and watch it manually then I'll go to the idea detail page and i will look at the transcript and those structures and [00:17:50] again the goal and the reason I'm doing this is that I'm trying to mine patterns across those seven [00:17:55] ideal lego breaks.
So that i know what Works in my space okay, so when I'm analyzing each video [00:18:00] and I'm going through this mining process what am i actually looking for with respect to the lego Bricks i like to go about this [00:18:05] in two ways as well the first Category is Daily inspiration and really what I'm looking for [00:18:10] here are specific topics angles and key visuals interesting to me that might be [00:18:15] a topic i wanna make soon and I'm doing this Daily Daily inspiring pieces [00:18:20] on the other side of long term Monthly and Weekly.
Tracking that I'm doing hook [00:18:25] structure story structure visual format you may not see a common pattern across visual formats in just Twenty [00:18:30] videos on one day but holistically if i do this every day for a week am i starting [00:18:35] to see the same story structure that's more of long term so I'm doing like real time Daily and long term at [00:18:40] the same time when I'm mind.
So for me i like to open a Google doc and i set it up like this at the top of the page [00:18:45] I've got Daily inspiration each bullet is a topic and so if i see a video i like and the topic [00:18:50] is interesting I'll grab that video and i will write the follow it topics en [00:18:55] anything about the hook that popped out to me key visuals also drop the link [00:19:00] for that video there i have.
And en any audio notes about this video so it's all me [00:19:05] analyzing this one video not an aggregate pattern it's this one specific video [00:19:10] was it interesting to me and what did i like about it then below in a separate section on the page i have [00:19:15] more of these longterm patterns that I'm trying to monitor over time and so I've got hook structures [00:19:20] series structures and visual formats Anytime i start to have an idea pop in my head about a Trend across any [00:19:25] of those three that I'm starting to notice i write it down.
And to click down even one step further this is literally what i do i [00:19:30] open the video and i watch it the first filter is this do i find this topic interesting or is [00:19:35] it kind of dumb and not relevant to me because obviously you're not gonna remake a video if you think it's dumb and interesting so [00:19:40] that's like the first dumb filter anything that doesn't pass through i just skip it and ignore it.
Right so we [00:19:45] get past that first now after i get past that kind of like dumb check filter and i do see a video that [00:19:50] inspires me I'm gonna open the doc I'm gonna add that new bullet topic and I'm gonna write all those things down [00:19:55] am i interested about this what did they say what were there certain lines they said that peak my interest [00:20:00] were there visuals they use are there gaps that I'm seeing that could be potentially Filled.
Did they use certain audio de [00:20:05] I'm just writing notes down about the effectiveness of this video cuz the truth is if I'm looking [00:20:10] at it using sandcastles this is an outlier so they did something that worked what was it that [00:20:15] worked I'm trying to figure that out and I'm using this doc bucketing it by lego break cause I'm trying to figure out.
Where [00:20:20] are the wi point what did they do well but then what didn't they do well that if i remix i can beat after [00:20:25] going through Twenty to thirty videos in a single session i will have a list of ideas topics [00:20:30] that i liked that are also validated by the market and my goal like i said is to [00:20:35] Analyze those seven lego breaks of the outlier figure out what they did really well that i want to [00:20:40] keep constant and what they didn't do well.
That i can improve on now typically for me what I've [00:20:45] noticed is i will almost always change the angle the hook and the visual format but usually i will [00:20:50] leave the topic some of the key visuals and usually like the audio mood of it but this is all [00:20:55] an iterative process it changes topic to topic it changes niche to niche the point is you know how to [00:21:00] pull the winners and look for why they want and where wi [00:21:05] spot now if you Guys want i can make another video in the future that's just.
A screen share live session for an hour of me [00:21:10] in sand Castle doing this like voici over the process what am i seeing for every single video [00:21:15] why am i pulling it i can do that for you we don't have time to go through deep examples in this video but if [00:21:20] you want that come below and I'll know to make that video.
Okay. So that really es the easy mode process of [00:21:25] how to do idea mining in a nutshell you're gonna use San Castle do ai to create a list of the [00:21:30] top Creators in your niche you're gonna use that to aggregate the best Performing videos en one place and then [00:21:35] you're gonna Analyze them one by one and when you watch each video you're gonna look for insight across [00:21:40] every lego break what was the topic what was their take premise or angle what [00:21:45] was the hook they used and how was it executed how did they structure the story.
What was the visual [00:21:50] layout or visual format were there compelling key visuals they used or not what was the audio [00:21:55] and did it emotionally drive you to the feeling that you thought was compelling based on those [00:22:00] Answers you are going to assess where the white space what was we about that outlier that you could [00:22:05] improve on to make an even better version and the best part about using sandcastles for this process es that there no [00:22:10] no you're only seeing the best Performing videos in your space so that helps you see the patterns way faster.[00:22:15]

I Studied 100 Viral Hooks, These 6 Will Make You Go Viral
[00:00:00] Kallaway: The biggest difference between winning and losing on social media es the hot this is the [00:00:05] eighty Twenty of video if you want your videos to perform better you need to focus on leveling up your [00:00:10] hos has studied thousands of videos and it turns out all of the best performers only use [00:00:15] six different hot format if you know the six your set su in this video I'm gonna break [00:00:20] all that down first we're gonna walk through all six hook formats with examples and then [00:00:25] I'm gonna give you a full playbook for how to.
Actually right winning hawks on your own i guarantee [00:00:30] this will be the best video on hawks you ever watch and i know this Works because I've done billions of [00:00:35] views myself using these exact same methods all right now first before anything else [00:00:40] we need to understand the Psychology behind how hawks work this is super important s [00:00:45] are designed for one reason to create a Curiosity loop think of it like a rabbit hole [00:00:50] in the viewer's brain.
We need to get them curious enough about the topic that they couldn't dream of doing anything [00:00:55] else other than watching our video now the best way to create that Curiosity loop es [00:01:00] with contrast the viewer starts the video believing one thing and then we introduce an alternative [00:01:05] in the hook they believe a we show them b and the distance between a and b is contrast the [00:01:10] bigger the contras the more the Curiosity and the deeper the hot it really is as simple [00:01:15] as that.
But the hard part is you only have five seconds to make it stick so each of these [00:01:20] six hook formats are specifically designed to create that contrast and build the [00:01:25] Curiosity loop right now the first hook format is called the Fortune Teller and it's all about positioning the [00:01:30] present against the future the Creators is using some scenario or question to build [00:01:35] Curiosity about how the future might change.
So this could mean saying something like that new microwave [00:01:40] is gonna change cooking Forever or that little blue light is gonna impact traffic moving forward [00:01:45] here are a couple other exemples of the Fortune in action the break [00:01:50] is the future of animation and this Fortune Teller hook format Works super [00:01:55] well because the human brain is designed to constantly think about the future so it's playing into [00:02:00] that so the tactical steps for using this hook format would be.
A establish what the current reality [00:02:05] is b figure out how the future might change based on the video subject and c. [00:02:10] Frame a question or statement teasing that new future as a possibility and this format is great [00:02:15] for breaking news product innovations really anybody that's trying to build authority or interest around [00:02:20] knowing the future of some topic and again I'm going through all six of these base formats first so we [00:02:25] can build that baseline before going deeper tactically into how to actually write the hawks.
[00:02:30] And I'll go through that in a minute. Okay, now the second hook format is called the experimental and this one is all about [00:02:35] the Creator showcasing how something Works using a demo or experiment and specifically [00:02:40] this is angled as peer to peer it's one friend showing another what they learned or [00:02:45] came across so the contras is being built is coming from i used to do something this way i figured out some [00:02:50] method or format let me show you how now I'm doing this thing this way and here are a couple examples of [00:02:55] the experiment format in action.
Actually have [00:03:00] in my Recording with these on my face[00:03:05] 
[00:03:07] Speaker 2: the way that week this here is the [00:03:10] brand new chat chi eget that literally controls your [00:03:15] browser en dos Tasks for you and this is an eleven step process and [00:03:20] we're gonna see if it doesn't. 
[00:03:20] Kallaway: Especially love the Colin and Samir one because sairs actually showing how the glasses [00:03:25] work in the hook as well he doesn't have to use the hook to tee it up in the future because the glasses [00:03:30] camera is the subject itself and that video did fifty million views for a reason and a lot of [00:03:35] mr.
Beast videos fall into this hook Category as well he doesn't always explicitly explain them [00:03:40] as experiments but. He's basically doing human experiments and then letting you watch in real time [00:03:45] to see what happens so the tactical steps for using the experiment hook framework [00:03:50] r two a establish the base pain point that needs solving b show that you solve the [00:03:55] pain point or try some new method or tool with an experiment and then c.
Walk through why that [00:04:00] new experiment or solve is different and helps solve the pain point better and this format is great for product [00:04:05] demos new frameworks it's also great for B2B trying to showcase how your tool or product Works. [00:04:10] This is also the same hook framework where those people that make the elaborate Outdoor structures camping [00:04:15] or building a log cabin by hand this the same format they're using as well and before we keep going if you like [00:04:20] the way i break this content stuff down using the metaphors and the names to make it a little bit easier i actually did [00:04:25] the exact same thing around virality.
How does reality work breaking into a formula [00:04:30] you can actually grab that a free five day email course called the variety blueprint [00:04:35] explains concepts like this but in way more depth you can grab that there's a link below or go to virality blueprint [00:04:40] dot com and you can sign up right let's keep going now the third hook format is called the teacher and this one [00:04:45] is similar to the experimenter except that instead of going peer to peer it's going more teacher [00:04:50] to student and instead of showing things with a live experiment it's more showing them by framing et [00:04:55] lesson.
So it's kinda like I'm the teacher of this topic i just saw somebody who solved x with y [00:05:00] method let me break that down and explain to you how they did it again the contrast is coming [00:05:05] from you're failing at this thing i found new way to do it let me explain how to do it so that you can start winning [00:05:10] and here's a few examples of the teacher format in action three things you can learn from a [00:05:15] des ça 
[00:05:18] Speaker 3: a.
[00:05:20] In twelve hours using something called the product drop 
[00:05:23] Kallaway: en again these teaching set up [00:05:25] so it's either the créer tried something and extracted the lessons and is now teaching it not live [00:05:30] experiment but teaching the methods or they studied someone else who solved that thing and then is now teaching [00:05:35] those lessons back either way it's show by teaching and so the tactal steps for using [00:05:40] this one would be a established the base pain point b show that you have a solve through some set of learnings [00:05:45] or method and then see you walk them through why the processor steps worked because of your solve.
And this [00:05:50] format is super good for anybody's trying to build authority in the Category or become an Expert to then sell [00:05:55] that expertise okay, now the fourth hook framework is a little bit different than the other five it's called the [00:06:00] magician and it can be used as a precursor or in combination with the rest of them now the [00:06:05] magician is basically a stun gunn it's strategically using visuals and or language [00:06:10] like.
Hey, look at that. To visually force the viewer's attention to a specific thing in the visual and it's usually [00:06:15] something outlandish or just rhythmic and visually pops to stop the scroll now [00:06:20] there are a ton of amazing examples of people who do this.[00:06:25] 
[00:06:26] Speaker 4: Yo check. Esa the president Trump of [00:06:30] plan nucléaire space so 
[00:06:34] Kallaway: this can either be [00:06:35] executed with some visual stun tactic like what kasha uses the kind of snap click or it could [00:06:40] be the spoken words themselves like look at that crazy thing and really forcing the attention. Mi favorite example [00:06:45] of this is the niant sin guy who starts out as Trump with the wig makes a joke in the voice and then [00:06:50] throws the wig off and immediately starts talking about the niant site I've been using this on my own videos for the last [00:06:55] thirty or so where i start all the videos saying check this out quick and i roll into the first [00:07:00] line with it check out this.
It just Gives that kind of [00:07:05] Unique Signature pattern that people recognize when they hear another great way to [00:07:10] achieve the magician is with something called a visual pacifier now this is an activity that the [00:07:15] subject is doing passively. Which holds just enough of your subconscious attention to let you [00:07:20] focus on the thing this could either be like Alex Earl doing her makeup or this guy and this example [00:07:25] stacking the cups it's the same psychological reason why people make those GTA gameplay [00:07:30] videos the split screen and you see the car driving through the course on one end and then the clip on the other [00:07:35] it holds just enough subconscious attention to get you to focus and not churn on the main thing.[00:07:40] 
And i say this format is different because you can combine the magician with any of the other [00:07:45] five a lot of people stack them so they use the magician immediately as a visual stun gunn and then layer on one of the other five [00:07:50] below so tactically to do this you either wanna find some visual some sound or some [00:07:55] Signature thing that you can tie to your videos to kind of stun that's atypical and stops that scroll all right now the fifth.[00:08:00] 
Hook format is called the investigator and this one is super common with this format you're [00:08:05] basically trying to create contrast against some unknown secret or some finding that you [00:08:10] found in your research that nobody knows about so the contrast is today you don't know [00:08:15] the thing i show you the thing.
Nadie no de thing very simple almost all of my personal short videos fall [00:08:20] into this Category its kind of unearthing some think about the future potentially that people don [00:08:25] know about and there's a ton of amazing examples showcasing this format as well 
[00:08:29] Speaker 5: so this is one [00:08:30] of the
crazy it [00:08:35] not just 
[00:08:36] Kallaway: this is a secret Japanese City built at the base of [00:08:40] Mount fu it's not just any City so the tactical steps if you wanna use the investigator would be to. [00:08:45] Hop. The fact that there is some secret they don't know and then frame it against the current reality which is [00:08:50] not knowing and the communicated contras in this one is pretty straightforward because the base cases they don't know and then you [00:08:55] tell 'em something they know some of these don't have to be super chi they can be pretty straightforward but [00:09:00] inherently they'll still grab and create that.
Interest this format is great for people to use who are [00:09:05] trying to be at the leading edge of their field or showcase that in research capacity they're finding the deep [00:09:10] insights that most people d' know okay and the sixth and final hook format is called the contra [00:09:15] and this one is actually the easiest to understand where exactly the contras sits the contrarian hook [00:09:20] literally has the Creator come out specifically and say what they believe about the topic that is [00:09:25] different than the conventional wisdom and the difference between this one and some of the others is that.
A few the other [00:09:30] slightly try hide that contrast in the framing where is this one [00:09:35] immediately comme straight out and just say. You're doing your branding wrong you should be doing it this way it's very direct [00:09:40] here a few examples of the contrarian in 
[00:09:41] Speaker 5: practice so i think this is probably the most important thing you [00:09:45] need to be doing if you a you not and this having one on one [00:09:50] convers your s.
Have no creative ideas your space 
[00:09:54] Speaker 3: sky.[00:09:55] 
En the wing es [00:10:00] best now 
[00:10:01] Kallaway: of the six ho formats this one is the most direct à creating that [00:10:05] contrast it's really easy the tactical steps would be figure out what you believe that most people don't believe and then [00:10:10] say it explicitly this is great for the smart pants Expert use case or somebody is trying to [00:10:15] frame themselves as a a crowd space.
Ok, so we have it those are the six [00:10:20] s the Fortune the experiment. The teacher the magician [00:10:25] the investigator and the contra you don't actually have to figure out [00:10:30] which one of the six Works for your video because the truth es every single video idea [00:10:35] could be manipulated to use any of the six hook formats for example let's say i [00:10:40] made videos reviewing backpacks in this new interesting backpack just came out that i wanted to make a video [00:10:45] about.
How would i go about using all six of these in different ways so for the Fortune Teller i may [00:10:50] say something like this backpack is gonna completely change the way millennials travel for the [00:10:55] experimenter i might say i just took this backpack seven thousand miles across the world but it has three major [00:11:00] design flas for the teacher i may say something like if you're traveling internationally this summer.
This is the [00:11:05] best way to pack your backpack for the magician i may do a rapid match cut with a bunch [00:11:10] of different backpacks to visually stun them and then with the voiceover saying which of these backpacks is the best [00:11:15] for a guy in their twenties for the investigator i may say something like i can't believe this company isn't marketing [00:11:20] this one flaw in their bag.
And then for the contrarian i may say something like everybody loves this bag but if you [00:11:25] use it every day it is so over hyped see so you can pick any of those hook directions [00:11:30] with every single video topic and so the real question is how do you decide if you're staring at the blank page [00:11:35] and you're trying to write a hook which of these is the best one for you in any given scenario.
And this [00:11:40] really gets into the second part of the video which is tactically how do you actually write a banger hook [00:11:45] that crushes every single time cuz that's where the sauce really lies so let's walk through that [00:11:50] I'm gonna break the whole thing down right now all hooks are made up of four components the spoken hook which is what you [00:11:55] say the visual hook which is what you show on the screen the text hook which is [00:12:00] what you write in text on the screen and then the audio which is the sound and sound Effects.
[00:12:05] That you play in the background and this is the big secret right here the difference between five hundred [00:12:10] and five hundred thousand views is unlocking max alignment between [00:12:15] those four things so if you say one thing verbally but then the visual even slightly [00:12:20] different that creates misalignment and then the hook is not as effective.
To nail the you [00:12:25] need all for these things to line up perfect and the business matters is because of [00:12:30] comprehension comprehension is the degree to which the viewer actually understands what they're seeing and [00:12:35] hearing you can't hook them unless they fully understand and are interested in what they're [00:12:40] watching.
If your verbal spoken hook is different from your visual hook which is different from the music [00:12:45] in your audio hook well that leads to confusion and confusion leads to comprehension loss [00:12:50] which just makes it harder for the viewer to stick with the hook the way to drive max comprehension [00:12:55] is to make sure the visual and audio hooks are aligned and so how do you do this.
The [00:13:00] way you do this is to understand exactly how the viewer takes in the video when they're watching and [00:13:05] this gets to the deep Psychology which is my favorite thing to do imagine a subconscious heat [00:13:10] map when somebody's watching the video where are they actually focusing their attention I'm gonna tell you [00:13:15] this is what all viewers do the first thing they do is they take in the visual and [00:13:20] text hook they see the visual they may read the text hook if it's obvious enough in the right place and [00:13:25] then they.
Your ketchup and they hear the spoken hoc after and after they hear what you're saying they [00:13:30] look back at the visual and they're seeking visual confirmation with what they heard so it's [00:13:35] visual audio visual that sandwich is how people actually take in videos at the subconscious [00:13:40] level now why is this the case.
Well. The reason is our eyes process ten to a hundred times [00:13:45] more information per second than our ears and this is essentially the speed of light versus speed of [00:13:50] sound phenomena so the viewer is seeing first then hearing and then looking back at the visual to [00:13:55] match what they heard. Okay, so tactically tying all this together what does this actually mean and why did i spend so much time [00:14:00] going through those six hook archetypes what this means is that the most important part of getting the [00:14:05] hook to actually perform well.
Is the visual it's not what you say [00:14:10] it's the visual i call this the key visual so when you first have your video idea the very first thing you should do is [00:14:15] figure out what visual or visuals you have your disposal that you could actually slot into the [00:14:20] first three to five seconds and based on that key visual you then need to decide which of the six hook [00:14:25] archetypes will create the most contrast and perfectly align with what that visual [00:14:30] chose knowing the visual.
Lets you set up the speech to then set back [00:14:35] up to the visual this is the golden approach to hooks that nobody talks about at this level all right so now [00:14:40] I'm gonna say it again one more time but more organized so the very first step is you need to look at what visuals do [00:14:45] you have the better the visual the more you can lean on the visual and the easier will be to set up the contrast back [00:14:50] to the visual if you don't have a good visual you need to really think should i make this video and if you [00:14:55] do wanna make it.
How are you gonna manufacture the key visual with motion graphics or [00:15:00] some stock footage to create this interesting thing to look at step two is that 11 you have the visual [00:15:05] you need to think about what are the most interesting fact sets or angles things about the story that you [00:15:10] have to work with and based on those what has the biggest contrast which everyone has the biggest [00:15:15] contrast will inform which of the six hook archetypes that you actually use step three is that i would then [00:15:20] write the spoken hook this is gonna be two to four lines and it's gonna follow the context le.
[00:15:25] Contrast and contra back approach that i detailed in my video a link here [00:15:30] step four is then what text can i put on screen overlaying the video to [00:15:35] support that initial visual and the reconfirmation of the visual after someone hears the speech and [00:15:40] then step five I'm going to watch it back and gu check with myself does this achieve [00:15:45] max comprehension if the viewer goes visual speech visual.
Or they very clear [00:15:50] on what I'm talking about in this video and does that align with where i think the rest of the video will go [00:15:55] if not i will stop not move forward and rework the hawk that is how important it is [00:16:00] really quick i just wanna walk through a couple examples of my own content to illustrate what [00:16:05] i mean by good and bad hooks we're gonna show one of each the first one is an example of a perfect [00:16:10] hook this video is about life size floor Plans which is really cool.
Projected home floor [00:16:15] Plans in a Warehouse this video did fifteen million views so the first thing i want to do is watch this [00:16:20] video with no sound we're gonna turn the sound off just watch the hook visually and i want you to think [00:16:25] where do your eyes go what do you notice and what do you see so we're gonna play that right now [00:16:30] all right now the first place your eyes probably go is that sliding text that [00:16:35] comes across that says the future of home design this first clip with a split screen you don't actually see that [00:16:40] well.
The girl with the arms going up that was more just a visual stun gunn the actual hero visual the [00:16:45] key visual that i saw in the idea that i knew i was gonna build the whole video around was the [00:16:50] next visual in the full screen with the people walking on top of the floor Plans what i [00:16:55] did is i put text that said life size floor Plans with an arrow enhancing the [00:17:00] fact that your visual eyeline.
Went directly to that thing i wanted to make sure you saw that and so [00:17:05] this was the visual shocker right there's embedded contrast here most people have never seen this before so the fact [00:17:10] that it existed on its own created a large contrast i knew that visual was a great [00:17:15] key visual to build off of okay, so the next thing is i had actually pick which of the hook formats that i [00:17:20] wanna go with and then how would i actually write the ho itself so when i looked at the formats there were two that made [00:17:25] sense.
One was the Fortune Teller this is the future of home design and the second one was the [00:17:30] secret Keeper i found this secret about how people are designing homes that nobody knew they're close to the same but [00:17:35] slightly different i went with the Fortune Teller one cause which is easier to explain and creates more of a shock [00:17:40] this is what the future of home design will look like right so that's what i picked and then step three [00:17:45] was i had actually right the hawk so context contrast.
So i literally. Said [00:17:50] check this out that was my magician scroll stop thing and then i said these are life size floor plants [00:17:55] you can literally walk through your exact home design before you build it right so that's context [00:18:00] lean that is me literally describing exactly what you're seeing that is perfect alignment with [00:18:05] showing the visual and saying the thing then for this one i didn't actually need a contrasting word i didn't [00:18:10] need to say but here's what's crazy because the fact that it existed on its own was already contrast enough.[00:18:15] 
Take which maps to the future Fortune was i think this is the future [00:18:20] of how people are gonna design their homes so it's exactly what I'm saying i picked the Fortune Teller i talked about [00:18:25] the future i set up the context le what you're seeing with pure alignment and then i framed [00:18:30] this is the future of how people are gonna design their homes.
That is Taylor made how you build the hook with [00:18:35] pure alignment and this one worked fifteen million views now before we end the video lets quickly go through one [00:18:40] bad example where i made a video but it didn't work out that well got maybe a hundred thousand views or [00:18:45] less and the hook was just executed super poorly so i wanna explain what went wrong and what [00:18:50] i should have done looking back.
Okay, so the same thing here i want you to watch this video without sound just watch [00:18:55] the first fifteen seconds. And tell me where you focus your attention[00:19:00] [00:19:05] 
right away you see the text Sling across again future of storytelling and then you [00:19:10] see a bunch of these rooms kind of like magically appearing out of nowhere. Just that [00:19:15] alone is kind of misaligned future of storytelling is a bit of an abstract concept and so [00:19:20] visualizing that with those rooms does that really mean future of storytelling not really so [00:19:25] already just in the visual and with the text there is comprehension loss then [00:19:30] when you turn the sound on it gets even more confusing so i say this is the future of storytelling it's called a [00:19:35] generative world model it lets you turn a single image into a Photo realistic cinematic [00:19:40] world okay, so if you really take that down.
Future of storytelling it's so abstract it's like what do you even show for that maybe [00:19:45] it's a book with a video or a robot coming out of it maybe i could have used that the problem [00:19:50] is nobody knows what generative world model is nobody knows what Photo realistic world so i use these crazy [00:19:55] terms that i didn't have good visuals to show and you can tell immediately it's just a little confusing it's not as [00:20:00] straightforward as the life size floor Plans one and so when you watch this.
Yeah maybe you're like oh those are [00:20:05] cool visuals but you're not actually hearing what I'm saying when you don't hear what I'm saying you have comprehension loss when you have [00:20:10] comprehension loss you're not purely tied and aligned with the video and so looking back maybe what i should've done has [00:20:15] gone more explicit so these rooms are the future of commercials and if i had visuals of [00:20:20] Guys actually using those rooms to film commercials and i could show that Perspective maybe that would've worked [00:20:25] the truth is this video didn't have great b roll that was easy to explain so what i should have done is [00:20:30] probably can the idea.
Not made it en general and that's really what you need to decide when you're going through this process what [00:20:35] is the visual what is the hook format writing the hook is there clarity and [00:20:40] alignment if there isn't you probably should throw out the video because there's always more ideas that you could make so that's really [00:20:45] the process in a nutshell you have to have that clarity and if you don't that's the difference between ten [00:20:50] thousand views and ten million views.
And look the reason that i can go so deep and I'm so nerdy on this stuff is because i [00:20:55] live and breathe this content stuff all day long and I'm making this channel because I'm trying to show my [00:21:00] experiments and show my work to help other people grow with content but look if you don't want to have to worry [00:21:05] about which hook format to use and how to exactly write it you don't wanna take Sixty minutes a day making [00:21:10] videos.
That's completely fine i built sandcastle which is a software to infuse all [00:21:15] of these learnings and formulas and formats into it so all you do is put your video in and we will do [00:21:20] it for you we go through the full diagnostic to figure out what is the right hook formula how [00:21:25] should we frame it where is the best contrast it's all automatic so if you wanna try that out Castle i have [00:21:30] a free you below that's the easiest way that you can close the gap on this without [00:21:35] having to do all the work.
En Guys if you like how i think about this stuff there is a ton more for free in the [00:21:40] description i have a free contact community called wavy world with over thirteen thousand people that are learning the [00:21:45] advanced Psychology behind this stuff there's a free invite for you below make sure to grab that and keep me posting [00:21:50] on what you Guys want next keep the shares coming keep the Comments coming until then we'll see you Guys on the next [00:21:55] one peace.

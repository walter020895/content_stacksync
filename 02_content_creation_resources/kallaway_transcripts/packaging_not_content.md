Why The Smartest Creators I Know Focus on Packaging, Not Content
[00:00:00] Kallaway: If your content is underperforming the main reason why that's happening is the packaging this is [00:00:05] the number one area all my smartest friends obsess over and if you don't know what packaging [00:00:10] is or have a strategy for it you're at a massive disadvantage because here's the truth if you have bad [00:00:15] packaging you don't even really have a chance of making content that's gonna perform well.
So if you [00:00:20] wanna grow faster and make sure the time you spend making content is worth it packaging is [00:00:25] the area you need to en this video breakdown ten tactical tips en frameworks [00:00:30] to help you improve your packaging immediately and 11 you hear this inc. [00:00:35] I guarantee your videos o star crush by the way im Calloway have the million [00:00:40] bills the view and content is all i do.
All day long the first tac tip to [00:00:45] understand is what content packaging actually means and why it's so important packaging for [00:00:50] youtube is the title the thumbnail and the intro the video the first thirty [00:00:55] Sixty seconds packaging for social media es the first line of the caption the thumbnail and the hot the first three de [00:01:00] five seconds here's why packaging is the most important aspect of the content workflow and [00:01:05] why the smartest Creators spend most de time focus on it.
Imagine in front of you was [00:01:10] a table full of gifts. Now on the table they're all different shapes and sizes some laced with [00:01:15] bos some in bags some with colorful rapping paper you get the picture now if i only gave you [00:01:20] one second to look at the table and pick a gift which is the first one that catches your eye.[00:01:25] 
For most people it's gonna be that gold one on the right hand side now why is this for one the [00:01:30] packaging of the gold one is generally different and more eye-catching than all the others it pops out [00:01:35] more and just like a deer in the Woods people notice things that are atypical from the conventional pattern [00:01:40] because the human brain is trained to spot differences now if i told you to walk up to the table [00:01:45] and pick one of the gifts to unwrap and you weren't trying to be chiqui you would probably go and pick the [00:01:50] gold one and the reason for that is because the gold one looks most valuable to you.
And you're [00:01:55] curious te figure what value is inside this one to punch of initial awareness [00:02:00] and then rapid value based Curiosity es the chico code to winning packaging and in this video we're gonna get [00:02:05] into a bunch of tactical Psychology tips and tactics that you can use to improve your [00:02:10] packaging so more people click and watch but just to finish the metaphor here's really why content [00:02:15] packaging is so important.
For all the gifts on the table you don't pick up they might as well have been empty [00:02:20] boxes on the inside because the truth is it doesn't matter what's inside if no one [00:02:25] ever looks think about it if each of those gifts represented a piece of content you spent hours making [00:02:30] but nobody ever picks them up in unwraps them well then what's inside might as well have been fifteen [00:02:35] minutes of black screen mr.
Beas is Famous for saying if they don't click. They don't [00:02:40] watch packaging is the heart of getting the view the click and store watching in [00:02:45] the first place and if you can't do that literally nothing else matters in the content workflow [00:02:50] downstream now before i go on to the next point and give you all the tactics and tricks that i personally use one [00:02:55] more point of clarification on this whole metaphor you might be thinking all right the gifts on the table thing makes sense for youtube because [00:03:00] we're looking at a home feed of thumbnails and choosing what to pick pero en social media i don't get to [00:03:05] choose the feed just serves up videos so how does that make sense in this whole thing.
On social media with short form [00:03:10] video instead of having a table full of gifts that you choose you're getting served gifts [00:03:15] one at a time on the feed by the a. And with short form video it's the packaging job to get [00:03:20] you to stop scrolling and choose to unwrap the gift so it's a bit of a different mechanism but it's [00:03:25] the exact same game whether it's youtube or social media the packaging must get the viewer to opt [00:03:30] in and watch or nothing else matters now if you believe what I'm saying about the packaging and you should [00:03:35] you're probably thinking all right just tell me what to change with my packaging so it's better and more people [00:03:40] watch and so let's do that.
First I'm gonna go through a rapid fire list of frameworks and [00:03:45] tactics that apply to youtube packaging for long form content and then I'm gonna do the same thing different tips [00:03:50] and tactics for short form social media packaging if you care about content i recommend watching the [00:03:55] entire thing because the pieces are different but the Psychology applies to both and spoiler they're [00:04:00] about eight gems in here that i have never heard anybody talk about.
So lets dive right packaging tip [00:04:05] number one for youtube is about contrast and color Science here's how youtube actually Works after [00:04:10] just a few hours of watching on youtube of your homepage is gonna start having more and more videos from the [00:04:15] same niche or Category if you like watching marketing videos you're gonna start seeing more and more [00:04:20] marketing videos show up on the feed.
Now typically the design meta for thumbnails in a given [00:04:25] niche tends to converge on the same aesthetic and colors and that's because most [00:04:30] people are lazy and so if one person in the Category rips everyone just copies what they see and does the [00:04:35] exact same thing what ends up happening is that when a viewer looks at a grid of thumbnails in a given niche [00:04:40] nothing pops out because all of the design and colors look the same.
And en this case [00:04:45] the one they end up clicking on anything with they recognize face like a big personal brand or [00:04:50] Famous person because the colors never grab attention. However the easiest way to [00:04:55] get your packaging the pop especially if you're smaller or not as well known is by inversing [00:05:00] the color meta of the Category so for example the thumbnail design pattern in your niche is [00:05:05] typically dark and busy then go light en minimal if your Category is typically colorful and bright [00:05:10] then go monochromatic and there's actually proven neuroscience.
Behind this [00:05:15] the brain processes colors and brightness much faster than it can interpret objects in text [00:05:20] so if you just inverse the colors brightness and orientation of the design in your [00:05:25] Category you get a lot more people to stop and pay attention to your initially nada. The best way to figure out [00:05:30] what the design meta is of your ni Category es to use the tool like click pilot add a bunch of the [00:05:35] top channels zoom out look at the grid and try to assess what the color pattern [00:05:40] or design pattern looks like.
When you slide your thumbnail into the script does it pop out [00:05:45] or not if not and your face is relatively unknown then you've got a packaging problem cuz your thumbnails [00:05:50] will not be clickable relative to the field so the takeaway for this first point is this if [00:05:55] your niche on youtube converges on a particular color Science design pattern.
[00:06:00] In verse it so yours pop in contrast more les number two for youtube packaging [00:06:05] goes along the same lines and if you've been making youtube videos for a while and they haven't been working i [00:06:10] guarantee this one's gonna piss you off here's the fact that i learned way too late that really matters for packaging.
[00:06:15] More than eighty percent of youtube viewers are scrolling on youtube in dark mode that means [00:06:20] the dark gray or blackish background on your phone or desktop so if [00:06:25] you designed your thumbnails to pop on the traditionally white screen and you view [00:06:30] some darkish gray background well when you flip the dark mode if they don't pop out your co [00:06:35] so this tip is critical when you do all the color contrast work that i just mentioned in the first point [00:06:40] make sure you're doing it.
On dark mode you have to pop against the field and [00:06:45] against the background of your phone and desktop en dark mode this is a super easy fix but a huge design [00:06:50] mistake that a lot of people are making all right packaging tip number three for youtube is understanding packaging [00:06:55] Psychology here's how the Psychology actually Works when someone is scrolling through youtube and trying [00:07:00] to decide which cad press e goes like this d.
[00:07:05] Thumbnail title thumbnail click. That is the flow let me explain this i [00:07:10] mentioned this a little bit before about how the brain process but let me explain this here when the brain is rapidly processing for [00:07:15] information it goes through two stages the first is called bottoms up processing and this is where the [00:07:20] visual cortex can assess things like colors motion brightness and broad [00:07:25] orientation but it's not Crystal clear it assesses those things rapidly think of it [00:07:30] like.
A blind person that can beely see they can't really make out exactly the letters [00:07:35] and objects but they could see colors blur they could see motion happening that's how your [00:07:40] brain Works rapidly in real time it happens in like two hundreds so the very first step in packaging [00:07:45] Psychology and what happens in real time all the time on youtube is that as someone scrolling their [00:07:50] brain sees a different color.
Different brightness some [00:07:55] motion popping out of the corner of their eye and that's what initially locks them on to seeing if [00:08:00] something's interesting so that's step one the initial thumbnail they haven't actually looked at it and comprehended [00:08:05] what it is but they've just aimed their attention towards it that's step one.
Now step two is 11 [00:08:10] they aime their attention typically a viewer will Glance down at the title they won't try to diagnose [00:08:15] the thumbnail first they go title first and this is because thumbnails have a lot going on even though there's [00:08:20] more contextual information process the load and processing power required to [00:08:25] understand a full th couple words es high low so the brain [00:08:30] sis the easy your path which is to read the title and try to understand what it means.
Now on the first [00:08:35] go of reading the title most viewers don fully comprehen sense unless it's perfectly worded [00:08:40] however their is catch a few key words and they start to build a comprehension map [00:08:45] about what that sentence actually means obviously the more comprehend of the title first look [00:08:50] the better this is why shorter title on youtube win people absorb higher percentage and they get [00:08:55] the meaning cuer at this stage on the title comprehension they really asking themselves is this a [00:09:00] go or no go no go they skip and go to the next one.
Go they need more information before [00:09:05] clicking rarely will they click on the video just by reading the title they then [00:09:10] look back up to the thumbnail and this is step three so again I'm going through the Psychology [00:09:15] it's initial thumbnail title comprehension go no go decision back to the thumbnail that's where we're at [00:09:20] but this time when they see the thumbnail their brain has shifted into a different processing mode it's called top [00:09:25] down here they're actually ingesting the objects the graphics the text and they're trying to make [00:09:30] sense of what it means.
The first thumbnail exposure was just colors and brightness [00:09:35] now they're actually going for comprehension when they deduce comprehension from the thumbnail if that matches [00:09:40] the keywords or meaning that they drive from the title and they're interested they're gonna click [00:09:45] now like i said this is super nerdy but knowing this flow how someone actually progresses through [00:09:50] the thumbnail title thumbnail click flow is very important because at each stage [00:09:55] something could go wrong and then you can know how to fix it here's the guck you should be running first like i said go [00:10:00] into click pilot.
Put your thumbnail in a sea of if you're not even noticing it initially in [00:10:05] the sea well then you have a problem at that first step that's a color brightness motion issue. [00:10:10] If you are noticing it but then 11 you read the title you're just not curious enough to go back to the [00:10:15] thumbnail well then you have a problem with title clarity and comprehension going through this one two three [00:10:20] step process will help you understand where your packaging is failing so you can improve it more quickly [00:10:25] have you like the lessons that have gone through so far.
I've spent the last couple months in secret working on [00:10:30] the youtube Growth playbook literally everything i about youtube all [00:10:35] the stuff all the Psychology systems et i workflow templates everything you need [00:10:40] to win on youtube all in one there is nothing even close on the internet to this thing that I'm [00:10:45] together now I've got a wait les link in the description for this i might only drop it one time for one day and then [00:10:50] it's closed Forever I'm not yet how we're gonna do it.
But i promise you if you think you might [00:10:55] want to hear my full comprehensive advanced mode and give you my system for Growth on [00:11:00] youtube I'd be on that wait list that's all I'm gonna say for now tip number four for youtube [00:11:05] packaging is gonna sound obvious but i guarantee a lot of you are making this mistake i call it trust quality [00:11:10] here's what's really happening in a viewer's brain when they deciding to click and this is different [00:11:15] psychologically from what we just went over.
What have you is really doing is voting with their trust [00:11:20] that if they watch a video and spend their time that it will solve a problems [00:11:25] or give them value back they're to assess et score of how well they trust the [00:11:30] video will be able de do that en this dance of assessing that trust is going en real time every single time they look [00:11:35] at a title thumb combination.
So here's an easy framework to think about this it is really helpful for me imagine [00:11:40] a viewer. Has a trust score of one to one hundred with every single title thumbnail combination [00:11:45] that they see so as they look at the title de thumbnail the Creators [00:11:50] name the amount of views already on the video and all the other attributes that they can see they're trying to assess that score from [00:11:55] one to one hundred on if this video will actually deliver the promise made.
Now if a viewer really [00:12:00] has a problem that they need solved they might be willing to drop that trust score down [00:12:05] let's say to Twenty percent or Twenty out of a hundred so anything that's over Twenty [00:12:10] they're willing to give it a chance cuz they really want that problem solved. If a viewer doesn't really want a problem solve [00:12:15] the trust score required to get them to click might be eighty above or ninety above [00:12:20] and so the packaging combination would have to be above that to get them to click think of it kind of like based on what a [00:12:25] viewer needs they set a line and then any packaging above that line.
They're likely to click [00:12:30] on it now there are all sorts of attributes and factors that go into this big pot to help the viewer [00:12:35] decide what their trust score is for a given package the biggest two of course are the [00:12:40] comprehension they get from the title what they think it means and the comprehension they get from the thumbnail what they think it [00:12:45] means but another huge one to fix that really helps boost your trust score in the viewers [00:12:50] eyes.
Is the design quality of the thumbnail itself is the Photo o Graphic [00:12:55] you're using sharp o is it blurry is the headshot well lit or does it look DIY [00:13:00] is the font big enough to read and clean and la clearly does it look tasteful or does it [00:13:05] look slap together in other words is the thumbnail well design I'm not talking about the comprehension ability [00:13:10] of it although they go hand in hand just from a design aesthetic when they see it.[00:13:15] 
Does it look professional and above the line they would expect to see on [00:13:20] youtube or below the quality of the design is actually a sneaky important factor in moving that [00:13:25] trust score line up or down and if the design is crap if it doesn't look good it really hurts the [00:13:30] trust score and so if you have a really poorly designed thumbnail the only people that are gonna click on it.
Are people [00:13:35] that really really have the problem you're talking about and so their trust line is all the way [00:13:40] down to like five if you don't have design skills pay someone who does thumbnails are [00:13:45] the most important thing and the cheapest thing to solve for I've got a link at the description below to the thumbnail Guys [00:13:50] that i like if you Guys want an intro totally fine if not find somebody that can solve [00:13:55] this problem for you if you're not good with design right packaging lesson number five for youtube is the [00:14:00] intro of the video.
Now i haven't talked very much about the intro so far in this video to be honest i can make a whole [00:14:05] other video on intro alone here's the best tactical tip i could share about the [00:14:10] intro so you can improve your packaging the title domin Nails job es to get the click initially and pass [00:14:15] that viewer off to the intro the intros job is to transition [00:14:20] between that positive emotional expectation from the click and the first hit of value they get [00:14:25] in the body of the video.
The intro es the middle man bring the viewer from one to the if the intro [00:14:30] can bridge the viewer from click to value it is done its job now you study youtube and you know what packaging is [00:14:35] you probably heard the phrase confirm the click a million times before now to make sure it does [00:14:40] this ask yourself this based on the title thumbnail.
What should the viewer [00:14:45] expect to get out of this video and say that thing in the intro as soon as possible so for [00:14:50] example the title of this video you're watching right now was this why the smartest Creators i know focus on [00:14:55] packaging not content and then in my intro for this video earlier i literally said [00:15:00] this in this video we're talking about content packaging if your content is under Performing the main reason that's [00:15:05] happening is the packaging this is the number one area my friends [00:15:10] over.
So the first second en third lines of the intro world literally repeating the title [00:15:15] verbatim because i wanted to confirm the click that click confirmation took me four seconds and that's an [00:15:20] example of what good intros do to feed the viewer expectation [00:15:25] and confirm it right now I'm gonna transition to the short form social media side of the house and packaging [00:15:30] tips for that by the way i have a lot more of these youtube packaging tips in the holster so if you want me to make [00:15:35] another video just about youtube packaging comment something like.
More youtube chef and then I'll know in [00:15:40] the Comments what that means and also if you like the way I'm laying these out and you're an entrepreneur i built a [00:15:45] free community with Sixty five trainings just like this for you it's a bunch of business owners trying to get [00:15:50] better at content we have thirty three thousand people in there and like i said it's completely free it's called wavey world i got link in the [00:15:55] description for you if you wanna joint now that promised i wanna go through a few tactical packaging tips that apply [00:16:00] to short form video.
En social media now as reminder for short form videos what does packaging mean [00:16:05] it's the first line of the caption the text that shows at the bottom above the fold it's the [00:16:10] thumbnail we're gonna get to that later and most importantly it's the hot the first three to five seconds all [00:16:15] three parts visual spoken and text now as i said before because short form videos get [00:16:20] automatically served up in the feed the packaging has one less job it doesn't have to get you to click [00:16:25] and watch but it does have to get you to stop and watch.
And i call this [00:16:30] opting in you have to get a viewer to stop scrolling and opt in to wanting to watch now the only thing [00:16:35] that matters for that opting es the hawk and that's why this first tip that I'm gonna go through for short form packaging is all [00:16:40] about the clarity in the spoken hawk the hawk matters so much more on short form [00:16:45] than youtube and here's why that's true from a Psychology Perspective on youtube you get to use [00:16:50] the static title and thumbnail to build some expectation of what the topic will be about so as [00:16:55] long as the intro confirms that expectation.
You're golden and they're gonna watch but on social media [00:17:00] the viewer is seeing your video coming in completely cold they have no previous [00:17:05] context on the idea they weren't expecting it to come and they have no idea what you're talking about when they start watching so you need that initial [00:17:10] hook to both focus them on you and build that expectation loop about what they're gonna [00:17:15] expect in like three seconds this means that the clarity of the messaging in the hook has to be so [00:17:20] dialed that it both informs the viewer.
What the video's gonna be about and inspires [00:17:25] them to want stay because they trust that that value will be transferred now I've made tons of [00:17:30] videos about short form hawks I've also made a lot of videos about hook script writing specifically and i will link those in the description [00:17:35] below but here's the eighty Twenty tip when it comes to clarity in spoken hawks if you [00:17:40] cannot read your script back just first line first two lines and both immediately [00:17:45] know what the video's gonna be about and have enough Curiosity to want to keep reading the s.
Not good enough. [00:17:50] So it's absolutely critical that you compress the hook down so the clarity is [00:17:55] maximized and the Curiosity is maximized that's tip number one right now tip number two for short form [00:18:00] number seven overall is about the visual hook now the visual hook is made up of the actual [00:18:05] visuals that show in the hook when you run it and i want you to think back to that section for the youtube [00:18:10] part where i talked about how the brain perceive color motion and brightness differently [00:18:15] bottoms up than it does top down if you want your hook to jump out and separate from everything on the feed.
All you [00:18:20] have to do is ratchet up the color the motion and the brightness you can't do it too much [00:18:25] where you turn it up to the point where it overwhelms like a flash bang or a stro light and you also can't do it to the point where [00:18:30] the visuals disconnect from what's being said and the clarity goes down so those are two [00:18:35] potholes to avoid but if you can just turn up the color and the motion and the brightness a little bit you'll [00:18:40] win you literally stunned the subconscious brain into focusing on the video.
And this Works [00:18:45] because people cannot outr their own processing they cannot intentionally try to not care [00:18:50] about dos things it's programmed in the DNA so more Unique colors more motion more brightness that's all you need now that [00:18:55] might not hold them that's all about the storytelling in the script right now that's a different video but if you just wanna stop the scroll.[00:19:00] 
That les number eight is about the text ho and if you haven't watched any my other videos on [00:19:05] hawks now you know there are three core components that make up a short video hawk you have the [00:19:10] visual hawk which is the visuals being shown how they're laid and what the visual are you have the [00:19:15] spoken hook.
What is being said and then you have the text hook any words that are being shown on top of the [00:19:20] visuals now the text hook is typically not the captions the word for word you're saying but usually it's a title text [00:19:25] or title hook that is extra words that pop up at the beginning that help give the [00:19:30] viewer more context on what the video's gonna be about now if you don't use text hooks you [00:19:35] don't use title hooks point blank you should be and most of the best short form videos you see they are using te and title hooks because of [00:19:40] the processing speed.
Ya es people see visuals before text but they can process reading words [00:19:45] before they can hear them so if the visuals act like a st. Gun which holds man [00:19:50] the text talk will act like initial context so they know what the video is gonna be about cuz your [00:19:55] choice is for context are text or speech and like i said text is faster in speech [00:20:00] the speed of light is fast in the speed of sound people si and can actually understand faster they can hear think [00:20:05] and process so if you want another advantage in improving your packaging videos.
Start [00:20:10] using title text hooks there can be any font any size any color treatment as long as they pop [00:20:15] out on the visual and your eyes go to it. By the way if you struggle with hots the most for short [00:20:20] video accept a couple things that'll make it a hundred times easier for you in San Castle is my content [00:20:25] super tool that I've been building we just released our latest hero feature which the hot volt this [00:20:30] allows you to save any hot from your videos or other videos into reusable [00:20:35] component so for example let's say say you see a video de crushed and you really like the hook and you wanna save that [00:20:40] hook as a template that you can then use to generate your own hooks for different topics.
In [00:20:45] Castle you can literally just press save the we will transcribe that ho Convert into mad [00:20:50] l. Format that Works for any topic and then when you are using un script you just one click press [00:20:55] and we will new ho in that style it's sick this is the easiest way to solve riding and [00:21:00] 11 you build up this of s you'll never have to think about again if you wanna try for free sa Castle [00:21:05] all right here's another social media packaging tip that most people will not talk about i think short [00:21:10] form video thumbnails actually matter a lot more than people think.
En when i say thumbnail I'm talking [00:21:15] about the static image that you see that shows when you're scrolling someone's feet [00:21:20] now of course the thumbnail has nothing to do with the video actually being served up on the feed and [00:21:25] getting people to watch initially but after it's posted it has a lot to do with [00:21:30] three core use cases for one and most importantly when your video gets shared in a group DM [00:21:35] like on Instagram it gets shared via DM the thing that shows in the DM is the thumbnail so the people in [00:21:40] that DM guaranteed the click it.
Pero if the thumbnails is good and compelling they might the [00:21:45] difference between five people in a group DM clicking and watching your video versus two is massive [00:21:50] when you're talking about thousands or tens of thousands of shares so a better and clear [00:21:55] thumbnail will get clicked more often that's why i spend an extra five to ten minutes on my videos.
Custom [00:22:00] designing my own thil now the second reason the thumbnail matters is because when you're trying to Convert un new fan [00:22:05] into a super fan they're gonna hit your profile and try to binge six to ten more of your videos en [00:22:10] one session the easiest way to get them to binge the right ones es to make thumbnails [00:22:15] where it's clear what each video is about the more they see they actually like the more they're gonna watch and the easier it'll be to get them to become a [00:22:20] super fan if someone goes to your profile and you don't have the thumbnails optimized you're missing a huge opportunity.
And the third thing es [00:22:25] having your thumb helps the athetic of your prof. Matters a lot when someone hits it and [00:22:30] Convert to a new so while all three of those use cases don't mean more initial watch time on [00:22:35] the feed de matter a ton downstream that will lead to more fans and more a few people talk about this [00:22:40] i think a custom can a massive difference.

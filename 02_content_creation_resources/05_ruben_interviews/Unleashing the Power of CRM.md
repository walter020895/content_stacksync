# Unleashing the Power of CRM

**host:** What was it like to have two different cultures, uh, while growing up? Uh, did it, uh, affect like, uh, you're essentially trilingual as I can see, right? Or is it pual? Um, adding some German and 

**Ruben:** so, so, so I'm a very light German, so, so I might not be able to speak German on podcast. Um, but, but yeah, I speak French Italian, uh, so this is like, I always grew up with it.

And then like we, I learned, I learned English on the go, right? So I, I read, I read at university. It was a completely crazy, crazy time. You know, it was very, you know, like I, I, I would barely present myself, you know, and then like, uh, alert on the go, you know, on the 

**host:** fly. Uh, with courses, with, uh, with very hard work.

You can't put enough money in marketing. You can't put enough money in, uh, you know, your pr how you are, uh, being perceived, right? You need a community. You need people who will come back to you because they like your solution. They like your product. Exactly. And you need. That's what three 

**Ruben:** customers, you know, the real customers, which actually pay for your product because they love it and actually use it daily.

And you engage with them. Mm-hmm. Every single day. You know, and this is, so you should talk to your customers every single day. You talk to prospects and current customers every single day and, and you know, like if people pay for your product and use it, it truly means. The world technically right.

**host:** How are you? Hey, actually, how, how is it going for you? It's going amazing for me. How is it going for you? Uh, so then let's start with the basic question. Where are you from? Where were you born and brought up? And, uh, what was your education like? Yeah, absolutely. So, so, 

**Ruben:** so I'm Reuben, right? So my, so, so, so my dad is French, my mom is Italian, and I grew up across to Geneva in, on the French border.

Um, so actually I've always been like, um, completely split between three countries, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Um, so, so I grew up in France. Uh, uh, and then I, I, I went to St. Galland to the University of St. Galland for my studies. Um, this is where I basically got really into this world of, of, uh, of, you know, first touch of the, of, of the world of tech, because I did a bachelor in business and then I went there.

Um, with one year exchange in Singapore, and then I did one year internship in, in, in Munich. Um, in a startup? Yeah. As data scientist, data engineer. And this is basically where I all learned about the tech and about the data and the data space. And then after that I decided to. To actually, uh, start on a master of computer science because I was like, maybe a master of business will not teach me that much because, you know, I was, uh, really trying to make the best out of my bachelor already.

So I was like maybe a, I already did some part of the, of the master doing my master during my bachelor. So maybe I just want to, I just want to, to to, to get much more technical, and this is where I started like a master in, in, um, in data science, computer science at EPFL here in Anne. I see. 

**host:** What was it like to have two different cultures, uh, while growing up?

Right. Uh, did it, uh, affect like, uh, you're essentially trilingual as I can see. Or is it Pual? Um, adding some German and 

**Ruben:** so, so, so I'm a very light German, so, so I might not be able to speak German on the podcast. Um, but, but yeah, I speak French Italian, uh, so this is like, I always grew up with it. And then like we, I learned, I learned English on the go, right?

So I, I read, I read it at a university and it was a completely crazy, crazy time, you know, it was very. Like I, I would barely present myself, you know? And then like, uh, I learned on the go, you know, on the fly, uh, with courses, with, uh, with very hard work. Then, then I learned how to speak English eventually.

So I think after, after, after six years or seven years of living on in English, maybe, you know, 

**host:** you, 

**Ruben:** you pick it up pretty 

**host:** fast. I see. When was the time when you thought, you know what, I want to get into the startup ecosystem. Was it, uh, around your internship in Germany, as you said? So actually like 

**Ruben:** during my internship in Germany, it is where I really realized that, you know, stacking would be a big idea and where I decided to build, uh, to build startups and then like, you know, which kind of refined into the stacking idea, which we know today.

But, but like, so when did I really knew, uh, I would build a startup. I would like. Literally, when I was a kid, I was always, you know, I was, I always said like, you know, I want to make my own company. You know, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna build something big, you know, I want to, I want to create something. Right? Um, so I, I, so I think for me, like, so the fact that I would, I would do companies like, it's complete, it's completely, you know, like, uh, from the store, right?

It was no, no surprise to my parents, you know, when I was like, okay, well now I'm gonna do a startup. Um, then the space of tech is really when I started to, to understand, you know, in tech everything is possible. With only your few lines of code, you can do whatever you want. And this is really what, um, what really made me empower me to actually build something material like a product, um, and make it a company basically.

**host:** Yeah, absolutely agree. You know, like, uh, coding is such an inventive space. People can create everything in absolutely anything out of, uh, anything, right? You just need to know the basics and you're good to go. Right? Add more to it. So, uh, how did, uh, what was taxing as an idea? So, uh, I, I'll just, uh, present that anecdote for people who don't know why he, uh, encourages people when they're applying, that you should, uh, present your startup as so and so.

Say if I'm making a marketplace, which is for, uh, say engineering, I'd say, uh, X, Y, z startup is like Uber, but for engineering, right? So how did taxing fit within that frame of words and what was the origin of the idea? So the origin of the idea itself is basically I was 

**Ruben:** helping a friend, uh, actually a cousin to, to, to create, um, uh, his company, to the best company, right?

And basically we were in the need of thinking different system. Right. So, so, but like, not only in one way, but in two way sync and in real time actually to, to, to really have, uh, crisp right data you can trust. And then I was like thinking like, okay, there is no tool which actually do two way syn on the market.

Really? There there were no, and actually like, then I was like, okay, maybe I'm just gonna build myself with only a few coding skills, which I know, uh, I tried to use Zapier, I tried to use like word cattle. I tried to use like, uh, different things and it was very, very hard. So then, like, I tried, I tried to beat myself, to beat myself.

It was extremely hard. So I eventually, at that point, I didn't make it. But like, I, I, I understood, you know, that, that there was something that, that this was something people wanted. Basically, I had to find an alternative, a horrible workaround to what I wanted because I couldn't get it on the market. And people were complaining on the forums that this production exists everywhere.

So then I was like, okay, now this is like, this seems to be something people want. This seems, this seems to be something big, you know, a big whale. This is the idea I'm gonna commit. And then I, I decided to commit. And from there, you know, um, nothing could stop us, basically. Like, I just, I just, I just just kept going and, and, and, and here we are.

And then, so, so yeah. So maybe you want to know more about the story of the company? How did it evolve and merge and, and, and Until, until we got into yc, um, which was just like in the winter 24 batch, just like, uh, one month ago. It just finished. Uh, so now we're just out of the batch of voices, so maybe this is something we can also like, discuss.

**host:** No, absolutely. We'll get right into it. So, uh, can you give me a, like, timeline, which, what year was it when you were helping your cousin to build that program? So my, I 

**Ruben:** had my cousin, 

**host:** I 

**Ruben:** think in 2021. 

**host:** Okay. Or Yeah, or this was, uh, pre COVID or post COVID when things were back Yeah, kind of 

**Ruben:** post COVID. Kind of post COVID, but still COVID, right.

So people would still talk about it. Um, and then, and then, you know, like, um, uh, then, you know, like I tried to make some, so some MVPs and, and, but this was during my studies, right? So. So I started basically during my, during my studies to, to start to build the, the, some sort of programs which would do some sort of two-way syn, right?

So, so then I tried to, to, to iterate, um, uh, with, with some very bad versions of the product at, at, at the time, because actually two-way sink is a very complex product. So, so, you know, like thinking that people would build this over overnight is extremely hard. Is extremely hard. Um, and what we, what we're doing right now.

It's basically the following is that now we, uh, we basically like iterated over several versions and, and eventually we decided to change competitor direction and to go with two ways sync for enterprise systems, meaning like CRMs, HR systems, payment systems and more. And this is something that we're actually doing at stacking.

So, so, so, so the vision of stacking as it is, is pretty recent. It pretty emerged like, uh, end of last year. Basically. This is where we, we really started to build and commit, right? So now it's like a bit more than a year that we're building, uh, actually one and a half year that we're building stacking. And, and yeah.

So now we are reaching this, uh, this very good product for enterprise systems, uh, which is very advanced and actually, which is extremely hard to build. People will think, you know, two ways, think just one way and the other. And this makes to a sync. But actually it's not actually, it's like there is much more conflict management logics, which make it a very complex and fundamentally technical product.

**host:** I can believe that. And that's quite good to hear, like people wanting to get into it. Like that was, uh, obviously they, uh, like coding is again. Ask people don't credit it enough. It's quite tough as well. I've seen, uh, friends and family who get all heckled in their head and they're like, you know what, I'm just giving a pension.

So there must have been times where you would've fell down. Right. Uh, can you talk about that? How did you, you know, like got out of that kind of phase? So we had, we had many, 

**Ruben:** we had many moments where we got down. Um, I think I can talk about, like, I can talk about many, basically like in a startup, but again, in the journey of a startup, if someone wants to be an entrepreneur, it is gonna be mostly downs and ups.

Uh, and then suddenly you're gonna see a change where you have more ups and downs. And this moment. Is basically the moment where you start growing. But before the growth phase, you have more downs than ups and, and eventually you have to get resilient. So the, the, the biggest secret of entrepreneurs, right, is, is not giving up and being resilient, right?

So if you, if you start up keeps alive, persevering in the, in the hardship, right? For more than two years, you have a significantly, significantly higher chance to succeed. Then if you would give up like in any between zero to two years of existence. So, so one of the times where we were down actually, you know, it's like really at some points, right?

We were reaching, you know, when the plane started to touch the trees, you know, get so low, you touch the trees. This is where basically like, uh, our finances would get basically, um, at some point where we, where we wouldn't know how to, how to end up the month. So every month would be like a, with like a secrets, you know, we would have only have a two, three month or four month runway.

And, and then like we, we luckily found some angel investors and, and, and, and one VC called the Light Bird vc, which actually believed in us and say, Hey, actually I want to support you. And then suddenly, like we, we got back on track. Uh, but actually it didn't change, right? It's not because like the bank account was low, that the team was low, right?

We, we, we, we kept and we said, okay, we're gonna go until the last moment, until we can make this happen. And eventually perseverance. Right? Always, you know, you always get saved at the end, right? Just, just in a snap. And this is what happened to us. And this was a very, it was pretty much a long moment. For, for a few months.

For a few months, almost a year. We were very, very low. Um, so we really had to keep, uh, you know, hoping and, and persevering, uh, for this to happen. 

**host:** So by this time, uh, where you graduated from your master's, like finish Masters? No, 

**Ruben:** actually I was doing my studies. So we were two, so we were one. So I was, um, I was solo founder at the moment.

Uh, so I mean, I've always been a solo founder until, um, until my co-founder joined me. Um, um, like a few, like a few, a few, a few months ago, like, uh, like, uh, seven months ago, eight months ago. So, but, but eventually, right. I was, I was alone with, with, uh, with my, with my team member, um, Bilal, which we, which actually we made like the whole, the whole journey together, right?

So actually we had one salary to pay. Uh, and I wasn't getting paid, but you know, like the, the, the company would've expenses, right? So it's like somehow you have to pay sort of two salaries somehow, even though I wouldn't get a salary. And, and, and, and this has been dragging on for like one and a half years.

So absolutely crazy, right? 

**host:** It is. H how did it come about the moment when you realized, you know what, like this is now the product is taking Aship. We can pitch it to the investors. We can, uh, you know, like, uh, get some funding over that. When was that? When was that eureka moment for Ukraine? 

**Ruben:** So this moment was basically when you start getting the first customers, basically, like, you know, investors are good and everything is good, right?

But actually like. What's better is than investor money. It's customer money, right? Is the people who actually pay because you, you drive value for them, and they're willing to pay a share of the value you create for them with you. And this is a pricing. So, so basically like for us, like what was really like the moment where we could start to pitch to, to, of course investors, you pitch them like, because you know them and, and this happens.

But like for, for really VCs. You would pitch to them? Like once you have, uh, the first time attractions? Uh, I would say first, first time attractions and like, you know, like the first paying customers which actually pay a decent amount of po, a decent, a decent amount of money and actually like, have good experiences with the product and this is what we want to, to see.

Right. So, so, so it's like at some point, like you're not making a product for investors, right. So people who had AI on their, on their slide deck just because. You know, it pays investors and now they can get more founding, uh, eventually like this, this, this will never go, uh, to a good end. Like you have to make something people want, which is like basically the wise slogan.

And eventually as well, just if customers like you. Investors, the finances, the, the, the employees, the, the everything. Like everybody will like your company, but like first, a company is a successful company, is not a company that raises money. It's not a company which has a lot of press. Hype is not a company which, uh, gets into incubator programs and, and does some stuff like that.

A successful company is a company which has only one metric successful customers, and the money is a byproduct of successful customers. And success is a byproduct of money and successful customers. So 

**host:** yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. And uh, just something like, uh, I guess, uh, I have been noticing as a theme, you can't put enough money in marketing.

You can't put enough money in, uh. You know, your pr, how you are, uh, being perceived, right? You need a community. You need people who will come back to you because they like your solution. They like your product. Exactly. And you need real customers. That's what, right. You need real 

**Ruben:** customers. You know, the real customers, which actually pay for your product because they love it and actually use it daily, and you engage with them.

Mm-hmm. Every single day. And this is, so you should talk to your customers every single day. You should talk to prospects and current customers every single day. And, and you know, like if people pay for your product and use it, it truly means the world technically. Right? 

**host:** Really. No, I can see. Right. Uh, the way you even started looking at forums, looking at communities, Reddit, uh, get, you know, like, uh, is there a solution for this?

What, uh, you were, uh, you required back in that moment. Right. And when you see, okay, there's a real demand, you can actually go and make something out of it. Right? Provide that solution to so many, those who are in your position and requirement of such a thing. Yeah. That's great. Uh, and, uh, how has been your, uh, like, uh, is that what has taken you like, uh, you know, like community management and, uh, getting people, what, uh, how have you been, uh, putting your product, uh, forward to such people?

So the marketing strategy, actually 

**Ruben:** we, in the initial right, we would just get outbound, you know, like, I mean like we would go outbound on LinkedIn, on email, you know, and basically initially not try to sell. To sell, but just try to get product feedback. You know, like people just try it out and get, and just get feedback.

And eventually these people, they start using UB because they like it, or they would actually recommend someone because they like the product, but they don't have a use themselves, right? 'cause the problem with, with tools like Stack think is that it's very generic, right? So real time and two way sync between CRMs and databases.

You know, everybody has a CRM and everybody has a database, right? So actually it's a very generic need. So now how do you focus on a specific persona? And, and, uh, in the beginning, right, we, we didn't really understand. We had to, to laser focus on a specific persona. So basically we're trying just to reach everybody, so spray and pray strategy, right?

So we would just, just shoot emails and, and link messages and then people would gently give us feedback, you know, and that was it, right? And then you iterate over this feedback. Um, and then at some point, you know, we started to see some people say, actually, I like it and we're gonna, I'm gonna use it. And then like, it just went like this.

And these people referred to other people, which referred to other people. And then, you know, it just multiplied like this. And, and um, and here we are. So I feel like it was more word of mouth. Mm-hmm. Anything else? You know, any outbound efforts, which we basically stopped for a long time now. Um, and everything is just 

**host:** inbound and, uh, I believe you don't have any plans to do ads in the near future ads.

So we 

**Ruben:** don't have plans to do ads in the future. Uh, I mean, at least in the near future as we just evolve with word of mouth and just the, the, you know, so. Basically just like the customers, uh, just, just refer us, right? The current customer. So it starts to just organic growth for now. But at some point, you know, when we, when we're gonna be, uh, willing to have more growth, at some point, you know, we're gonna have to, to, to boost this up.

Um, but actually right now the persona that actually uses taxing is very diverse and we cover so many use cases. Actually, stacking is such a powerful tool. We have many use cases. So actually we do not know yet how to target exactly the persona. Which would need taxing because they're so diverse that you know, this would actually mean targeting everybody.

So before we just. Explore the whole space of opportunities, uh, and see who actually makes the best out of stacking then, and then, and then focusing on it for now, we just, um, get word of mouth. And actually this is not to, to, to, to fuel our growth 

**host:** right 

**Ruben:** now. 

**host:** That's right. I mean, we found you like that, right?

You didn't have any ads on that timeline. And so, but uh, another major factor in finding you, uh, and I would like to emphasize on that is yc. We have had a few vicey startups on board, uh, in the previous episodes. Uh, and I personally have a affectionate thing for yc, where I find it in its own essence, a little democratic, at least in the sense of the startup ecosystem by the people of the people, for the people and so on.

How was that like? Like what was the idea like, uh, did you have it in your head, uh, since you are, you know, uni that, you know, I want to get into CY someday, or, uh, was it something else that just came about now we are doing good, we need to be in a good accelerator. And what's better than cy? 

**Ruben:** So, so 

**host:** actually 

**Ruben:** regarding yc, I think it wasn't like something, you know, I was born with and I was like, yeah, I'm gonna go to yc.

I think like YC more came as. As an evidence when basically all the companies, which would actually be unicorns in our market, went through yc. Right? So, you know, like we're not necessarily competing with them, but you know, they're similar kind of peers, you know, data transfer, data ment, you know, you have air byte, you have Farran, you have high touch, uh, and you have like a whole bunch of other companies.

And this whole bunch of other companies eventually, like they, they, they're all unicorns because they went through yc, which is a very variable network for data companies. And, and then I was like, Hey, maybe, maybe we should, we, should we, we should also join. And when we, so first of all, I applied once and I got rejected.

Actually, I didn't even get to interview. Um, because actually I was a so founder. We didn't get customers at the moment. I mean like just little. Um, we, you know, the product was not really finished, you know, so, you know, it was not really, really, really okay. And then six months later with a lot of progress right now, you know, I found my excellent co-founder, you know, the team grew up.

Um, we got already some first investments and also like we, uh, the product was much more mature and, and, and really working. Then we, we had like this, um, this moment where we just applied and, and, and we got in almost immediately, within a week, right? So, so, so, so, so pretty, pretty fast. We applied in the, on the late application deadline and within a week we're in right.

Just, you know, like very, very, you know, way like one month after the closing of the applications. So it was really something which, uh, while the partners were really convinced about what we're doing, actually. 

**host:** Yeah, it would have come as a great motivation, right? Uh, people, uh, take, uh, YC in higher regard.

Seeing that, you know what, this is just our competitors went through, so why not us? That's, uh, pretty crazy in its own right. Uh, anyway. So, uh, you went through YC you had a sense of validation. You know what now, uh, you knew it, or I guess before even yc, that you have something that nobody else has made. Uh, you were aware of the competitors, right?

So, uh, do you also say, we briefly touched upon the topic of ai, right? A lot of companies will just take, uh, an API fitted in their somehow, uh, ui, ux and, uh, that's it. They're calling themselves a product or a startup. Right. Do you, uh, I don't know, uh, if I want to use the word threaten, but do you see that as a competition with the, especially with the OpenAI coming with more upgrades of four.

They came up with four. Oh, right. They're coming up with some, yeah. So they'll keep on doing that. Do you see that someday that might replace, uh, the product that you are building? How, how do you deal with that? What's the mindset of So actually Stacky is not 

**Ruben:** really an AI product. I mean, it has, you know, there can be some features in know, power bi, et cetera, and like some workflows and all that.

Mm-hmm. But the thing is, like the core of it is not ai. The core of it is the data synchronization. So if you think about the data. Data world, right? It's like a pyramid, right? Mm-hmm. So in the beginning you are like, 

**host:** no, if you'd, uh, allow me to correct, uh, I might have, uh, phased the question, uh, incorrectly.

What I mean is, uh, you know, like, uh, people can code from AI now, right? They can, uh, create games. They can, uh, create programs out of it directly, right? And with more upgrades, it'll be more possible to do, generate complex codes. So in that regard, do you feel threatened? You know what, some way some other people might create something which they don't have to pay for.

Yeah. So, so 

**Ruben:** eventually, like No, no. I think, I think we don't filter them at all by AI and especially like those developers, et cetera, because actually Stack Sync is a very excellent system because of its, uh, design and design encompasses many, many things such as like how do you have an, an architecture that scales to infinity?

Um, how do you, how do you leverage. The best, the best deployment technologies and infrastructure. Uh, how to use databases, you know, and streaming infrastructure, uh, cyber security, right? And if you look at our competitors, right, I mean, all competitors there are not really real competitors in to ayc because nobody really does it.

But like, even the people who do some kind of sort of shady to ayc or like suboptimal to ayc, right? They, they don't have, you know, like they don't have cyber security built in. You know, it's very like a shame, like the way it's done. Um, it's, it's, you know, it doesn't scale at all. You know, it's not really, it's absolutely not enterprise create.

So basically like we're, we're really addressing like a very special part of the segment, which is enterprise systems. And there are some other people who do two-way sync for no-code tools, for example, for some other systems. You know, like. But this, these are not enterprise ready and they're, and they don't scale.

And this is really where some where stacking position, right? And we don't have overlap with each other at all, right? So, so we're even friends because three, we do not address the exact same, same market and we'll never have same personas. So two way sync, um, two way sync for, for, for enterprise systems right now cannot even be replaced by humans.

And for it to be replaced by ai, it's almost impossible. 

**host:** I absolutely love it when someone is, uh, confident about their product, because that's the first thing. If you don't believe in your product, if you don't feel in the uniqueness, then no one else. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But, and, uh, kudos to you for Absolutely.

Absolutely. 

**Ruben:** But I think for us, I think for us, like we don't feel threatened by AI and like, even like humans, you know, like they, they even like excellent engineers which have worked at excellent companies that don't. Do something which is 10% what we're doing, not even 10%. So, so, so, so I mean, like before that we might just upgrade humanity before, and then we might think about what AI might be reproducing about us.

Um, but uh, but you know, it's, it's very different, right? So I would not, so I, I'm saying taxing 'cause taxing powers real time into a sync between CRMs and databases, which is a core operational infrastructure for companies to sync their data with their CRM and different enterprise systems. If, if we, if we would be talking about like an AI company, which is, let's say, uh, an AI document generation or whatever kind of AI topic, I would not say the the same thing at all.

Like this is completely different. Right. So, so because like the, the, uh, static is really a, a hardcore technology which we had to build from scratch. It's like we literally design algorithms, um, which is not the same as putting a front end together with some AI APIs. And then making, making something so something which is very good and actually serves a lots of people, right, but actually exists, can be, um, more and more disrupted by AI because AI becomes easier to implement, right?

And, and there is nothing secret, you know, in implementing a UI or a good serving. So maybe, maybe except like for a unique customer insight, which make founders design an amazing product. Like AI can disrupt a lot of, uh, a lot of fields. Exactly. Of course it can. 

**host:** And that's, uh, the threat that makes me really curious to ask people, okay, uh, what do you think about that?

You know, like, uh, what's your future plan regarding that? But, uh, if you, you know, like, uh, it's good to hear that you guys are confident in your own right. We are safe from that. So, uh, what's your current market like, where are you currently situated? Uh, what are the user numbers, if you can provide me with that kind of stack?

Uh, how is it going for stacking? So, so stacking 

**Ruben:** right now is going pretty well. We are ramping up. Um, we have some customers which use us for more and more use cases, which are more and more, you know. You know, scale use cases, which is very good to use because like all of our customers, they increase product usage week over week, which is like pretty good, you know, to see like people love it and they expand the data sync pattern within the organization.

They create more syncs and even, and even for the existing, existing data syns, they, I. Uh, the size of these things, right? So, so, so, you know, it's very cool to see that, you know, like the product gets more and more traction and usage with you. Our current customer base and new customer base now, the market basically looks like extremely well positioned, right?

So we have never been, you know, like data streaming, you know, real time data and, and bidirectional data. Exity has never been, you know, so high as a mark. So, so, you know, like companies now, you know, they have AI use cases as you were mentioning, so they need real time data because, you know, like they want to feed real time ai, uh, models with some data and then have, have this feedback into their customers and build engagement, you know, and send immediate, uh, AI emails, uh, you know, emails made, made with ai, which are completely.

Um, uh, customized, right? And they, and they want it to happen in real time. You know, it's not possible to do a once a day or batch job, you know, so this is what Stack Tank is really powering, and we see a lot of increasing usage on this, on this direction. I see. 

**host:** So in a way you can even say that, uh, the boom in AI is also gonna, you know, like result in you moving forward because ultimately these guys, uh, might and, uh, will end up as your customers, right, because they need that kind of data.

Exactly. Ai, AI really helps. Yeah. Eventually, yes, absolutely. Yeah. So, uh, picking on that and geographically speaking, you're in Switzerland right now and, uh, you would have, uh, like a good access to within the EU countries, right? Uh, with you also having a background, so you know, your, uh, stakeholders, you know where to contact, you have a good network.

Have you entered the North American, south American Asian market? So actually right now, so 

**Ruben:** since yc, we spend like three and a half month. Actually more three month than three and a half, but we spend three month in mm-hmm. Um, in, in San Francisco. And actually, like we, so right now basically our, our team will be split between Europe and.

The US and San Francisco. So, uh, so out of September, um, um, two of our co-founders basically is gonna go into, into, into San Francisco, and the rest of our team will stay here in Europe. And then like, we're gonna grow the team on both, uh, poles, you know, like, uh, uh, on both sides, like step by step. So, so actually we are fully, uh, we are fully into the American Pro.

Into the American market, and most of our users are American. So. We, uh, so we have no, no issue by penetrating both the European and the American market, especially because in Europe we're the only two way thing solution, which can be used in Europe because, I mean, which is generic, right? So excluding some, some competitors which have been built by, by CRM companies, by themself, uh, we're the only ones which can be used in Europe because we're the only one which is actually compliant, uh, with the regulations here.

And which has cyber security built in? So, so actually we're very familiar with both markets and this is also what makes us, um, uh, great, which is flexibility to navigate two different markets simultaneously. 

**host:** No, that was actually my next question, uh, which was regulation. So you answered that. Uh, yeah, like, uh, within that itself, my next, uh, part of that question would be, so the masses are majorly in, uh, like from where I am, right?

The subcontinent, the Asian subcontinent, and. Obviously, uh, you have like China, you have Russia, so do you have like, uh, any, uh, strategy for growth within those parts of the 

**Ruben:** world? So actually we can grow in any part of the world and simply because we have built a product where users can actually choose which region do they want to use for their processing.

So now you can say and say, I want to use stacking to sync, and I want my data to be processed, um, in, um, in Taiwan. You know, I want to be my, my data to be processed in Sydney in Berlin. Paris in, uh, in New York, in San Francisco. And actually you can choose which region you want to get your data processed.

And this is what makes your product very international and very compliant to any regulations because now your data can be processed in these countries. Right, 

**host:** which is very important, 

**Ruben:** obviously. 

**host:** So what is next for taxing? What are the next steps apart from, uh, what you already shared about team splitting and the growth in, uh, you know, like your human resources?

What's, uh, what are, what's the bigger picture? So 

**Ruben:** actually right now we are releasing, we release already a part of it in beta and we are releasing to more and more customers. Um, our New West performance upgrade, which gonna go up to 1 million records, which can sync up to 1 million records. Salesforce records a minute.

Um, 60,000 records a minute per for, for HubSpot, and much more so, which is absolutely insane. It's like, it's like a. It's like 10 times more than any other product on the market. Or maybe like for the most performance ones, you can go up to 50% or, or, or 200% more. Right? Which is, which is crazy. So actually we are releasing this, uh, performance grid.

And now that we have this and in all our entire system is really to scale to infinity. Now we actually gonna develop more and more connectors to serve actually more, more systems. So now stack sync work with five connectors. Among which, like Salesforce, HubSpot, Postgres, big Query and Snowflake. Uh, and then like, we're gonna grow this pallet of connectors, so now our customers gonna have much more synergies and gonna be able to integrate much more systems together.

**host:** I see. I'll take your word for it. It, uh, does sound some, uh, out of the world numbers and, uh, obviously, uh, you know. It's wonderful kind at the end. I just have that to say On a personal note, are you, uh, so you said, uh, since you were a child, you thought you would have something of your own. Uh, is that being fulfilled right now?

Are you achieving that goal? And furthermore, what is your end term goal? Where do you wanna see yourself in the future? So I think, 

**Ruben:** I think like the, the real, the real success of a company when you can see it right, is are you making your customer successful? Uh, and also like, are you, is your company, uh, growing?

Then later on, like the question changes to is your company profitable? And if you are making, if you're able to make this company profitable, I mean, this means that you create more value for people than you actually extract from them. And this is a very big reward, right? So actually this means that you are achieving something for humanity.

You are actually building something which makes people better, companies better, more efficient, and actually like, serve more people. So, um, so this is good. In terms of like, is this goal fulfilled? I mean, like right now we're just at the beginning of the taxing journey, right? So, uh, we are really enjoying what we're doing.

We're really building something. People want something which is an impact and really helps companies. Now what we're, what we're trying to do is that we're gonna see, um, I mean, we're gonna see how this evolves, right? Uh, but actually right now, if I have to say, um, we are really enjoying the journey. So this is something we like.

**host:** Yes. Good. And for the last question of this session, uh, is, uh, what was, how did you keep yourself from having a spaghetti brain, you know, like, uh, while working and because it, there are so many times, uh, and we have touched upon that, uh, in one of the, uh, previous questions as well. You know, like, uh, there are downloads, there are times that you feel, uh, you know, like it's the end of it.

So what would you suggest people to keep on doing to get out of that? Because everyone tells them, you know, okay, you should, uh, per, uh, perceive it through that, right? You should push through that phase. What is, uh, Reuben's personal, uh, advice that he must have followed through his? 

**Ruben:** So I have to say, I'm still entrepreneur, right?

So no entrepreneur really end, really ends the journey of being entrepreneur. So you are never like a senior, you know, like a, you know, like you might even reach your end of care year. You know, like you're still at the beginning of your entrepreneurial journey. 'cause you're always entrepreneur is about always learning.

And you know, like the goal of an entrepreneur. I mean, if people have problem with failure, entrepreneurship is really not the place to go because entrepreneurship is about failure, right? Uh, and it's actually about like, uh, getting up faster than you fail. So basically overall you, you, you, you fall less than you raise.

And this. Overall becomes like growth, right? So, so, so this is a goal and actually like, you know, as a, as a, as a CEO, right? As a, as a, as a leader of taxing. You know, I always get into problems that people can't solve, and once I know how to solve it, you know, I create, I create a playbook and I give it to someone else to now solve.

And now I, I, I, I go to another problem. And this problem is again, unresolved, right? And actually you are always learning. And actually you are always learning, especially when you are young. You're always having problems that you actually don't know how to handle. You know, sometimes you have technical problems, sometimes you have finance problems.

Sometimes you have like accounting problems, legal problems and stuff like this. And, and basically you always have problems that nobody ever told you or ever warned you about this. So this, this, this, this is just called experience. So you have to, even in the face of hardship and down, and, you know, like, like, like down periods, right?

This is important to know that you have to persevere, right? So, perseverance, resilience, and, and dedication. So a dedication as, uh, in the meaning of. Ruthless execution. These are the three things that you actually really need. You need to ruthless execute because you need to be always on deck. You have to outwork and outsmart competition like never before.

You know, like you have to you, you have to. You have to really. You know, if people expect you to deliver a hundred percent, you have to deliver 500%. You know, and, and, and, and anything lower than this is not enough, and you have to train on that rhythm because the day where you only deliver a hundred percent, it's gonna be easy for you.

For the others, it's gonna be hard, and actually you're gonna be, you're gonna be like feeling at home when you just deliver or, or, or as well over deliver. So always over deliver with the, with the roof execution. Then you have, of course. Perseverance because you know, no matter what happens, you, you, you continue continue until you would've no regret if it failed.

Right. This is a bit like the metric, right? So if you, if you, if if, if you were to stop today, would you have a regret? If yes, don't stop. If you say no, I just tried everything, you know, it's impossible. Like I just can't figure out how to make it work, then like, probably it's, it's, it's time to pivot or, or to change direction, but like.

Perseverance usually. I mean, this is something which comes very, very late. So basically you have to persevere all the time. And also resilience. I mean, it's most, most important because, you know, like when you, when you execute very, very, very ruthlessly, right? And you also, and you also like, uh, persevere all the time, you might hate like, uh, roadblocks, which are, which seems like mountains.

Uh, but this is something that you can overcome. It's something that you can overcome and, and, and you have to, to, yeah, to be resilient, to be resilient to any hit you might take. That's the most important. 

**host:** And that's, uh, a great advice and I hope it can help a lot of people who watch this, who listen to this or however they come across this.

And, uh, with that, I would really like to thank you for your time. Thank you so much. Thanks so much to you. We on and off. Yeah. Yeah. Well thank you so much Ruben and uh Alright. Have a great year ahead. Congratulations on the yc and yeah, I hope to stay in touch and let's do this again. Let's keep building.

Thank you.

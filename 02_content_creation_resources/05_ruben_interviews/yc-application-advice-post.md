# YC Application Advice Post - Ruben

Based on Ruben's real YC experience from interviews.

## Post

The YC application deadline is coming up.

I applied to YC twice. First time: rejected. Didn't even get an interview.

Second time: accepted within a week.

Same founder. Same idea. Here's what was different:

1) I wasn't a solo founder anymore. First application I was alone. Second application I had a co-founder and the team had grown. YC wants to see you can build a team, not just a product.

2) The product actually worked. First time it was unfinished. Second time it was in production with real customers. "Make something people want" is their slogan for a reason.

3) We had paying customers. Not many. But real ones. That proof mattered more than anything I wrote in the application.

4) I applied on the late deadline. Still got in fast. Progress matters more than timing.

I applied to YC because every unicorn in our space went through it. Airbyte, Fivetran, Hightouch. The network for data companies is real.

If you're applying this round and not ready, keep building. Six months of progress changed everything for me.

## Source Quotes from Interviews

**On why he applied to YC:**
> "YC more came as an evidence when basically all the companies which would actually be unicorns in our market went through YC... you have Airbyte, you have Fivetran, you have Hightouch... they're all unicorns because they went through YC, which is a very valuable network for data companies."

**On his first rejection:**
> "First of all, I applied once and I got rejected. Actually, I didn't even get to interview. Because actually I was a solo founder. We didn't get customers at the moment. I mean like just little. The product was not really finished."

**On his second application:**
> "Six months later with a lot of progress - now I found my excellent co-founder, the team grew up. We got already some first investments and also the product was much more mature and really working. Then we just applied and we got in almost immediately, within a week. We applied on the late application deadline and within a week we're in."

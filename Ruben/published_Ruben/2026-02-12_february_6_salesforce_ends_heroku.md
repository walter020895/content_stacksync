February 6: Salesforce ends Heroku
February 8: Salesforce airs a Super Bowl ad with MrBeast and a $1 million puzzle.

Heroku Connect was a very good way to sync a Postgres database with Salesforce. 

Thousands of companies depend on it. 
But no replacement announced.

Tens of millions on a Super Bowl puzzle 
vs 
Zero investment in keeping a core developer tool alive.

What does that tell you about where Salesforce is headed?

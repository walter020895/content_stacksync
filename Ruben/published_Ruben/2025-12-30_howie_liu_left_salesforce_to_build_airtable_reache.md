Howie Liu left Salesforce to build Airtable. Reached $11.7 billion. 
And then an investor asked him a simple question he couldn't answer: 

"Can you describe how your top 25 customers use Airtable?"
Liu couldn't do it.

"Howie was like the architect of a house who never saw the finished house," the investor said.

But this story starts years earlier.

In 2011, Liu was at Salesforce when he noticed something: almost 90% of spreadsheets don't have formulas. 

People weren't calculating, they were organizing.
 
They were building databases without knowing it.

He quit. 

He reconnected with two Duke friends. 

And instead of launching fast, they just read books for months. 
Engelbart. Alan Kay. Old HyperCard documentation from the 80s.

"It was almost like being on a sabbatical," his co-founder Andrew Ofstad said.

Then they built in silence for three years.

When they shipped, it spread through WeWork offices like a virus. 

Ofstad walked into a Manhattan co-working space and saw his product on every screen.

"Oh my God, this is actually a thing."

By 2021, Airtable hit $11.7 billion. And Liu made a mistake.

"I let myself get caught in the hyper-competitive environment. We tended to recruit as many smart people as we can and just throw them into the business."

In 2022 and 2023, he cut 40% of the company.

"It's a sickening feeling. I made the decisions that got us here."

His fix was to go backwards. 

He became what he calls an "IC CEO." He codes every day. 
He meets customers again.

"Executives should be in the details and experts at the actual craft. Not just delegators and managers."

The insight that built Airtable in first place came from paying attention to how people actually work.

And Losing that attention almost killed it.

Liu didn't find a new playbook. He returned to the original one. 
Pay attention, stay close and keep building.

We delivered a 6-month integration in 10 days.
But the 6-month estimate wasn't wrong.
A customer came to us with a real project:

 → Salesforce to their database
 → Bidirectional
 → Real-time

 They'd budgeted six months. Not a guess—based on doing this before.

 Building custom CRM integration from scratch genuinely takes that long:

 → Field-level sync
 → Conflict resolution
 → Rate limit management
 → Association handling

 Each piece adds weeks. The complexity is real.

 So how did we do it in 10 days?

 We didn't build it. They configured it.

 The infrastructure already exists. The complexity is already handled.

 Engineering time is the most expensive resource companies have.

 A team that would spend six months building can spend ten days configuring.

 Then get back to work that actually matters.

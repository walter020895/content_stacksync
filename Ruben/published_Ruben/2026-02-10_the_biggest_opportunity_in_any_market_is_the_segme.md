The biggest opportunity in any market is the segment the leaders won't touch.
SAP ignored mid-market. NetSuite built a $9.3B company there. 

I think The integration market has the same blind spot right now.

If your company runs NetSuite and Salesforce, your engineering team knows the pain. 

Custom API code to move data between the two. Authentication. Rate limits. Pagination. Retry logic. Every schema change breaks something.

The market offers two paths:

1. Enterprise middleware that costs six figures and takes months to deploy. 
2. Custom code your engineers write and babysit indefinitely.

Companies between $20M and $250M in revenue get squeezed. Too much data for basic tools. Not enough budget for enterprise platforms. So engineering teams become integration teams. Not building product. Maintaining plumbing.

Goldberg saw the same dynamic in 1998 and build Netsuite

When I started building in 2022, I found exactly this. No good option for a mid-market team that needed ERP and CRM data flowing in real time. 

Two paths: 
1. six-figure middleware 
2. custom code that eats your engineering capacity. 

Both were wrong answers.

Goldberg's lesson: find the segment the leaders consider too small to serve. Grow with those customers until you're too big to ignore.

Stacksync is built for that segment. Your ERP and CRM data in a database your engineers already know. SQL queries instead of middleware configurations. No six-figure contracts.

The gap in ERP was worth $9.3 billion. 

The gap in integration is just as wide.

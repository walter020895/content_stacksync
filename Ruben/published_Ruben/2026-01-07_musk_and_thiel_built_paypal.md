Musk and Thiel built PayPal
Then funded two brothers to replace it
Why would fund their own competition?

Because they recognized what Stripe was: 

the payments system they would have made if they'd thought about developers first.

Patrick Collison grew up in Dromineer, Ireland. 
Population: barely 100. The main sounds were wind and cows.

He learned to code from a book he bought at a Limerick bookshop. He was 10.

By 16, he'd invented his own programming language. 
By 19, he'd sold his first company. By 21, he was furious.

It was 2010. You could stream movies. 
Video chat across continents. Summon cars with your phone.

But charging a credit card online? 

Three weeks minimum. 
Merchant accounts. Gateway providers. PCI compliance.

"Why is this so hard?"

He called his brother John, still in college.
They dropped out and started building.

The premise was radical: 

What if accepting payments was as easy as copy-pasting a few lines of code?

Not weeks of integration. Not lawyers.
Seven lines of code.

Every VC said no. "Payments is solved."

Then Elon Musk invested. Peter Thiel invested. They'd built PayPal. 
They recognized what Stripe was doing.

The two brothers from a village of 100 people fixed what the entire payment industry had ignored for decades.

Today, Stripe processes hundreds of billions in transactions. 

Amazon uses it. Google uses it. 
So does the solo founder shipping at 2am.

Because Patrick and John never forgot what it feels like to be that person.
Building something with no resources. 

Just a book from a Limerick shop and the belief you could figure it out.

At 64, Oracle took his company
At 65, he started building again
At 71, he went public

Dave Duffield built his first billion-dollar company in his 40s.
He built his second in his 60s.

Some people retire. Others are just getting started.

In December of 2004 Dave Duffield is 64 years old. 
He should be retired.

For 18 months, Larry Ellison waged the most aggressive hostile takeover in enterprise software history. 

PeopleSoft —the company Dave built from nothing, ran for two decades— Oracle wanted to absorb it.

The shareholders voted and Oracle won. $10.3 billion.

Dave was out. His life's work belonged to Larry Ellison.

Probably most people would take the money and Disappear.

Dave called his former chief strategist.

"Let's get breakfast."

Three months later, Workday was incorporated.

Dave wrote the first check: $15 million of his own money.

At 65 years old, he started building again.

Former PeopleSoft employees—the "cream of the crop"—left Oracle to join him. 

They remembered what it was like to work for someone who cared.

The bet: enterprise software was moving to the cloud. Oracle couldn't cannibalize themselves.

Workday would build for cloud from day one.

In October 2012 Workday went public. 

Valuation: $9 billion.

But Dave did something else.

He structured dual-class voting rights so he and his co-founder control 67%. No hostile takeover can touch Workday.

No hostile takeover can touch Workday.

The move that killed PeopleSoft can't happen here.

"You can take my company. But you cannot stop me from building a better one. And this time, you can't take it."

Larry Ellison is worth $150 billion.

He still lost this fight.

There's a hierarchy that took us years to fully understand:
💰 Customer money beats investor money. 
🧑🏻‍💻 Product usage growth beats press coverage. 
📈 Profitability beats fundraising metrics. 
🚀 Week-over-week expansion beats vanity announcements.

We ran Stacksync for a year and a half before YC. 

No institutional backing.
Just customers who found enough value in what we built to pay for it. 

And then to use it more, and then to tell others.

You can't put enough money in marketing. 
You need real customers who pay for your product because they love it and use it daily.

A profitable company creates more value for people than it extracts from them. 

That's how markets work.

We've been operating on this hierarchy since the beginning.

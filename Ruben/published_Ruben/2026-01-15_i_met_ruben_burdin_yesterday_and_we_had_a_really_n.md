I met Ruben Burdin yesterday and we had a really nice chat about a lot of things...apps, the marketplace, partners, champions, the community, and ofc a little bit of AI.

He's CEO of Stacksync - Integration Cloud and while I haven't used it I could see the potential this brings to the ecosystem with managing data across tools at scale without dealing directly with API infrastructure (the two-way syncs are all managed through the UI).

There are a lot of projects that come to mind where this would have been a better path forward, it's exciting to see something like this in the marketplace.

If you're integrating data from other sources with HubSpot, it's worth checking out even if that's just to see what's possible when you connect data via API.

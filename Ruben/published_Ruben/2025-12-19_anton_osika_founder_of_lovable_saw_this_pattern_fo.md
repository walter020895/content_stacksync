Anton Osika founder of Lovable saw this pattern for years:

99% of the world's best ideas are trapped
Trapped in the heads of people who can't code:

The entrepreneur who sketched an app on a napkin but couldn't afford a developer. 

The teacher who imagined a tool for her students but didn't know where to start. 

The founder who burned through savings paying agencies for something that never worked.

As CTO at Depict (YC, $20M raised, billions of product recommendations served), he kept meeting brilliant people who were stuck. 

Waiting for engineers. Waiting for funding. Waiting.

Then ChatGPT-3 came out. 

And he started experimenting on weekends.

One weekend turned into a side project called GPT Engineer. 

A tool that could turn plain English into working code. He posted a demo video on Twitter and went to sleep.

He woke up at 4:47am to a phone that wouldn't stop buzzing.

GitHub stars. Thousands. Then tens of thousands. 

The fastest-growing code repository in GitHub history.

But it wasn't the numbers that got him.

It was one message from somebody from Texas: "I just built my first app ever. I'm crying."

He called his former colleague Fabian Hedin at 6am. 

By 8am, after a two-hour walk through Stockholm at sunrise, they'd decided to quit their jobs and build a company.

Y Combinator wanted them but they said NO.

They didn't want the fundraising circus. They wanted to build. From Stockholm. Their way.

Then they failed twice:

First launch, April 2024. "Good, but not great." Users came, hit walls, left.
Second launch, August 2024. Better tech. Same result.
Third launch, November 2024. Two days before, they changed the name from 

"GPT Engineer" to "Lovable."

This time it worked.

$4M ARR in 4 weeks. 
$10M ARR in 2 months. 
$100M ARR in 8 months.

At their peak: 25,000 new apps created every day.

And one stat that still doesn't sound real:

In one month, Lovable-built websites were 10% of all new websites on the entire internet.

Anton calls Lovable "the last piece of software."
It means: software that lets everyone create software.

Not the end of building.

The beginning of everyone building.

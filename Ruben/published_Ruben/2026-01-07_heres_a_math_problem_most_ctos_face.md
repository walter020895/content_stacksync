Here's a math problem most CTOs face:


Engineers required: 2-3
Integration project estimate: 6 months
Opportunity cost: Everything else those engineers could build

Now multiply that by every integration you need.

We've seen this calculation dozens of times over two years. The answer is always the same: too expensive, too slow, too much risk.

One customer brought us their 6-month plan. 10 days later, they were in production. Fully working. Two-way sync. No API maintenance.

The time savings compound. The engineers go back to product work. The integration doesn't break every time the vendor updates their API.

That's been the pattern. Not a one-time result. The consistent outcome for companies that stopped trying to build what we already built.

<!-- Kallaway Analysis -->
<!-- Hook Type: Contrarian | Topic: AI/Enterprise | Angle: AI-washing callout | Structure: Contrarian Hook → Evidence → Real Investment → Founder Lesson -->
<!-- Original Ruben post: True -->
<!-- Note: Hook B from draft was removed before publishing. Post opens directly with FactSet stat. -->
<!-- Typo in published version: "I've saw" should be "I saw" — flagged for LinkedIn edit -->

Last quarter, 306 S&P 500 companies mentioned AI on earnings calls. The 10-year average was 45. I've saw dozens of product demos. The founder says "AI-powered" in the first 30 seconds. Every time. When I ask what the AI actually does, I get one of three answers:

1. A chatbot on the support page
2. A GPT wrapper calling the same API everyone else is using
3. "It's on the roadmap"

That's not AI-powered.

The incentive is real. AI-labeled startups raise at 42-50% higher valuations. A two-word homepage change can be worth millions in funding.

The companies actually building with AI look nothing like this. They don't start with the model. They start with the data layer.

Because AI on top of fragmented data doesn't give you intelligence. It gives you confident wrong answers at scale.

We've watched this cycle before.

2015: "mobile-first" meant a responsive website.
2020: "cloud-native" meant one VM on AWS.
2025: "AI-powered" means a chat widget.

The label changes. The problem stays.

Companies invest in the marketing of a technology trend, not the infrastructure.

The ones that win don't rename their homepage. They rebuild what's underneath.

We see this at Stacksync. Companies layering AI on data that lives in five different systems. None of them talking to each other.

Real-time sync between your CRM, ERP, and database isn't glamorous. It doesn't look good on a landing page.

But it's the difference between AI-powered and AI-mentioned.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Direct, contrarian, founder-as-builder lens. Specific examples (chatbot, GPT wrapper, roadmap). Pattern recognition across hype cycles. Light Stacksync tie-in.
- **Idea Legos**: Contrarian hook + Evidence → Real Investment → Founder Lesson confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: FactSet proof (306 vs 45) → Evidence (3 fake AI answers) → Valuation incentive (PitchBook) → Real builders contrast → Historical cycle proof → Stacksync data layer → Callback close ("AI-mentioned")
- **Psychological triggers**: Outrage/Fear (companies deceiving buyers) + Tribal Identity (builders vs. marketers)
- **Image**: Toy Story meme — Buzz Lightyear (Marketing) showing Woody (Infrastructure) "AI EVERYWHERE"
- **Publishing edits vs draft**: Hook B removed (post opens with FactSet stat). "That's AI-mentioned" moved to callback-only. Data layer detail trimmed. "I've watched" → "We've watched". Image added (meme).
- **Typo**: "I've saw" in published version — should be "I saw" or "I've seen"
- **Factual sources**:
  - 306 S&P 500 companies mentioned AI on earnings calls, 10-year average 45 — FactSet Insight, late 2025 (https://insight.factset.com)
  - AI-labeled startups raise at 42-50% higher valuations — PitchBook/Carta AI Fundraising Trends, 2024 (https://carta.com/data/ai-fundraising-trends-2024/)

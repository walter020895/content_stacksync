The AI companies have a secret
OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, xAI. They all run analytics on the same database.

ClickHouse.

Now ClickHouse is launching managed Postgres. Powered by my friend's company, Ubicloud.

The Ubicloud team?
They built Postgres at Heroku, Citus Data, and Microsoft. 

💡 Why does this matter if you're running Salesforce, NetSuite, or HubSpot?

Postgres is becoming the center of the stack. Transactions and analytics in one place.

But most companies have a problem. 

Their Salesforce data is in Salesforce. 
Their NetSuite data is in NetSuite. 
Their HubSpot data is in HubSpot.

Silos everywhere.

ClickHouse can query billions of rows in milliseconds. But first, you need all that data in Postgres.

That's what we built Stacksync to do. 
Real-time sync between your CRM, ERP, and Postgres. Two-way. No API limits.

Congrats to Umur, Ozgunm, Daniel and the Ubicloud team. 
This is a big moment for the Postgres ecosystem.

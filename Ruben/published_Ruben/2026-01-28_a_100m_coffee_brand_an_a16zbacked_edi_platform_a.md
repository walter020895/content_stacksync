A $100M coffee brand, An a16z-backed EDI platform & A real-time sync engine.
Three companies that shouldn't have anything in common.

Except NetSuite.
And the scars from scaling on it.

Feb 4th— Fellow, Orderful, and Stacksync in one room. San Francisco.

Here's who's talking:

🎙️Arvind Jeyakumar — Head of Data at Fellow

Fellow got rejected by investors 73 times.
Bootstrapped for 8 years.
Now they're past $100M in revenue—selling in Target, Costco, and Nordstrom.

Arvind built the data infrastructure that made that scale possible. 

🎙️Blake Harries — Senior Channel Manager at Orderful.

Orderful is a16z-backed and just launched Mosaic—the first product to kill manual EDI mapping entirely.

Liquid Death. Faherty. Some of the fastest-moving brands run their partner onboarding through Orderful. 4x faster. Zero manual mapping.

Blake will share how they're solving the connectivity headaches NetSuite users know too well.

👤 And Stacksync?

We're the ones who figured out real-time, bi-directional sync between NetSuite and everything else. No more batch jobs. No more stale data. No more waiting until tomorrow.

Different products.
Different industries.
Same ERP battles.
Same lessons worth sharing.

Details:

📆 Date: February 4th
📍 Location: Fellow HQ Offices, 320 Florida Street, San Francisco, 94115.
🚗 Parking: Mission Bartlett Garage (3251 21st St) or 16th Street BART

Spots are limited to keep the conversation high-signal.

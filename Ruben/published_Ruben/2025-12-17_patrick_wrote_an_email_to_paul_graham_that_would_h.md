Patrick wrote an email to Paul Graham that would have killed Stripe.

He never sent it.

That email is worth $95 billion.

January 2010. Palo Alto. 2:47 AM.

Patrick was 21. His brother John slept on a frameless futon in the next room. 

The radiator clanked. The apartment smelled like Maruchan ramen.

37 banks had said no.

His laptop screen glowed with a draft email to Paul Graham:

"We're considering pivoting to something else..."

His finger moved toward Send.
But he stopped.

Paul Graham's essays taught him how to code. 

At 15, in rural Ireland, he'd printed them on a dot-matrix printer and read them like secrets.

He couldn't send a quit email to the man who started everything, right?
He closed the laptop.

The next morning he made one more call.

A woman named Christine at PayByWeb said yes when 37 others didn't.

That yes became Stripe.

Paul Graham would later call it one of YC's best investments ever.

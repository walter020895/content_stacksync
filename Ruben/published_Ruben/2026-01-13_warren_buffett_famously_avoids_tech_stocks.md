Warren Buffett famously avoids tech stocks
But he invested $735 million in Snowflake:

The Oracle of Omaha, who skipped Amazon, Google, Facebook, wrote a check for a database company.

Why?

Because Snowflake wasn't a tech bet. It was a business model bet.

The same logic that made Buffett billions in insurance applied to cloud data.

It all started in San Mateo, California. 2012:

Three men stand before a whiteboard covered in diagrams. They've been at this for months. Coffee cups stacking. Takeout containers accumulating.

Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Zukowski

They'd left Oracle—15 years of stable salary, stock options, the comfort of being cogs in a profitable machine.

Now they're in a cramped office, betting everything on an idea the entire industry says is wrong.

The prevailing wisdom: ️Hadoop is the future. Big data means MapReduce. Everyone knows this.

Benoit and Thierry think everyone is wrong.
"We were convinced there were many reasons why Hadoop would fail."

Their bet: the cloud could do something on-premise never could. Infinite elasticity. Compute that appears when you need it, disappears when you don't.

For 2 years, they built in stealth. But nobody believed them.

▪️Yahoo and Benchmark Capital backed Hortonworks.
▪️Accel and Greylock backed Cloudera.

Every analyst said Hadoop.

Then September 16, 2020.
Snowflake went public. Largest software IPO in history 🚀

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $735 million

The three architects who bet against every analyst, every VC, every conference keynote built something worth $70 billion.

Meanwhile:
▪️Hortonworks: merged, absorbed
▪️Cloudera: went private
▪️MapR: acquired by HPE after near-collapse

The smart money was wrong.
The three "crazy" guys from Oracle were right.

P.S. Snowflake gave you a place to store your data. But getting data in and out? Still painful. Stacksync syncs Snowflake with NetSuite, Salesforce, HubSpot, and 100+ other systems—in real-time.

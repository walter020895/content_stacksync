Why is HubSpot our most popular connector? 


We asked ourselves this a few months ago.
We had some theories but did not exactly know why.

So we did something simple:

I went into the HubSpot Community and started answering questions.
Not promoting and not selling, just helping.

One question became five, then fifty then five hundred.

2 weeks ago I got a badge notification: Problem Solver (500)

Only 22 people in the world have it. But the badge wasn't the point.

Every answer showed us something we'd missed.

Frustrations sometimes we miss in customer calls.

I went in to learn. 

We came out understanding our customers better than ever.

Go where they're already struggling and help. 

Thanks: HubSpot Community :)

Another year at SuiteConnect. Same reason as last year 
We stay close to our customers. That's the main reason Stacksync exists.

The product gets better every time we're in the same room as the people using it. Last year confirmed that. 

The conversations at SuiteConnect were some of the most useful we had all year.

Carter Supple, our sales engineer, is joining me this time. 

First SuiteConnect for him. 

If you're running NetSuite and thinking about how your data connects to the rest of your stack, come find us. 

Happy to chat.

PS: Photos from last year event, I hope to gather more this year.

40,000 companies run on NetSuite. 
We wanted to meet the practitioners behind them. 
So we brought together the NetSuite community of SF:


The SF NetSuite Series: From Silos to AI-Driven Ops. 
Second edition. 45 people. 

Every one of them lives inside NetSuite every day.
First edition had 15. This one tripled that. (even on a Super Bowl weekend) 

This happened:

▪️Arvind from Fellow (a $100M+ specialty coffee company) showed how they use Stacksync to sync their NetSuite data. 

Watching a company like that walk a room through how they use your product is something I won't forget.

▪️Blake Orderful (a16z-backed, $50M raised, #1 EDI platform) broke down how supply chain data actually moves between systems. 

▪️Even C-levels from Instacart were in the room.

Origami Precision helped us host and keep everything running smoothly.

What I learned going from 15 to 45: details compound. 

The check-in that knew your name. The champagne. The sushi. None of it revolutionary alone. Together it changes how people experience you.

15. Then 45. Next: 100s.

Huge thanks to everyone who came out!

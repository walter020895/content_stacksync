Fellow is a $100M+ coffee brand.

You've probably seen their kettles.
Maybe own their grinder.
Definitely seen the awards.

But here's what nobody talks about:

73 rejections before anyone said yes.

The Kickstarter that cost more to fulfill than it raised.
($200k raised - $300K cost)

The 8 years of bootstrapping before a single institutional dollar.

And underneath all of it?

A data infrastructure that had to scale faster than anyone planned.

Arvind Jeyakumar built it.

Founding data member at Fellow.
Designed the systems from zero to $100M.

The quiet architect behind the visible brand.

I couldn't be more excited to have Arvind share his story at our event.

There's a reason companies like Fellow survive when others don't—and a lot of it comes down to people like him. Builders who figure it out when there's no playbook.

Feb 4th. San Francisco. Fellow HQ

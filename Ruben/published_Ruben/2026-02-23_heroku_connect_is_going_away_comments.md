## NACHO

**Option A — One-liner**
> "The 'build it yourself' option always costs twice. In time and in talent."

**Option B — Blunt market read**
> "MuleSoft is the answer when someone wants to look like they solved the problem without solving the problem."

**Option C — Survival framing**
> "Teams that wait for a 'perfect migration window' are going to find out there isn't one."

## ALEXIS

**Option A — Complexity rerouted**
> "What Heroku Connect did well was abstract the complexity at the right level. None of the alternatives actually do that — they just move the complexity somewhere else. You trade one vendor dependency for six engineering decisions you weren't prepared to make."

**Option B — CTO pattern**
> "Most CTOs are going to look at MuleSoft pricing, say no, and immediately route this to an engineering ticket labeled 'we'll build it.' That's usually where the real clock starts."

**Option C — Technical close**
> "The 'minutes, not months' framing is the key. The difference between those two outcomes is whether you're rebuilding the abstraction layer Heroku was handling for you, you know?"

## CARTER

**Option A — This week**
> "I've had three discovery calls this week where the first thing they say is 'we just got the Heroku email.' Three. This week."

**Option B — Field irony**
> "'Build it yourself' — two of my prospects chose this option. Both are back in my calendar."

**Option C — Honest observation**
> "Companies don't realize what Heroku Connect actually did for them until they try to replace it."

## BRITTANY

**Option A — Ops layer**
> "The compliance piece is real. Every vendor migration is a contract review, a security questionnaire, and at least one insurance conversation nobody budgeted for. The six-month timeline isn't just engineering — it's the whole ops stack catching up."

**Option B — Team burden**
> "The thing I see in these transitions is how much they cost teams emotionally, not just technically. Engineers get handed a migration project with no clear owner, no clear deadline, and full accountability. That's a lot to carry."

**Option C — Warm urgency**
> "Y'all, the 'minutes not months' framing really is what matters here. Every month of migration pain is a month your team isn't building what they were actually hired to build. That has real costs you can't put in a budget line."

One of our most popular connectors: Postgres + HubSpot. 
Not because we pushed it. Because it solves the problem everyone hits👇

The problem:
Data teams want HubSpot data in their warehouse. 
RevOps wants warehouse data in HubSpot. 
Both want it now, not tomorrow morning.

The old way: 
Fivetran pulls data one direction. 
Hightouch pushes the other. 
Custom scripts handle conflicts. 

Three tools. Monthly bill. Constant maintenance.

The Stacksync way: One connection. Both directions. Real-time.

No batches. We handle rate limits so you don't have to. 
No 6-month integration project.

We built two-way sync because one-way sync was never enough.

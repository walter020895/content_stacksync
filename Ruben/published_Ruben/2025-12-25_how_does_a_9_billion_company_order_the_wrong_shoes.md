How does a $9 billion company order the wrong shoes for an entire quarter?
Two words: batch sync.

SAP for ERP
i2 Technologies for demand planning
Siebel for CRM

And 27 legacy ordering systems across the globe

In 2000, Nike tried to connect all of them at once. 
$400M budget on a two-year timeline.

By February 2001, they'd lost $100M in sales.

The i2 demand planner was supposed to predict what customers would buy
The supply chain module was supposed to tell factories what to build

SAP was supposed to tie it all together.

None of them could sync properly.
The demand planner stored data in one format.

The supply chain planner used another.
Engineers had to manually export and reimport data between systems every week.

Each entry took up to a minute to record. The system crashed constantly. Orders got deleted, duplicated, or just disappeared.

Factories spent months building Air Garnett sneakers nobody wanted.

They never got the order for Air Jordans that customers were actually asking for.

By the time anyone caught the mismatch, Nike was air-freighting shoes at $4-8 per pair instead of $0.75 by sea.

Stock dropped 20% in a single day.

Phil Knight's comment on the earnings call: 

"This is what you get for $400 million, huh?"

Nike kept going. The fix took five years. 
Mandatory 180-hour training. 

Phased rollouts instead of big bang. Moving demand planning into SAP.

They got there. 

But not before $100 million went up in smoke because two systems couldn't share data in real time.

Do you know any other case like this?

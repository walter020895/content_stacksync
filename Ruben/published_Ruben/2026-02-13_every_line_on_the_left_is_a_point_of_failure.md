Every line on the left is a point of failure.


Every line is a maintenance ticket. A rate limit. A 3am Slack alert.

Mid-market companies are running 10-15 integrations across their stack:
- Salesforce
- NetSuite
- Shopify
- Snowflake 

And stitching them together with 3-4 different tools that were never designed to talk to each other.

The result? 

Your data engineers spend 60% of their time babysitting pipelines instead of building product.

The Stacksync approach: one sync layer. Bidirectional. Real-time. Every system reads and writes through a single source of truth.

And one more thing:Enterprise level AI its comming to Stacksync too. :)

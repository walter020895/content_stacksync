OpenAI just broke ground on an AI campus larger than the Pentagon.
I had to re-read that twice.

Project Stargate. 

Rural Texas. $25 billion. Oracle and Vantage building it.

The scale is absurd:

1,200 acres = 2.5x Monaco 
3.7 million sq ft = Pentagon-sized 
1.4 gigawatts = one nuclear reactor 
250kW per rack = 5x hotter than Google's data centers

That last number matters. 

At 250kW density, you can't air-cool anymore. 
The physics don't work. Liquid cooling is the only option.

San Francisco uses 900 megawatts at peak demand. 

This one campus will pull 1,400.
First building goes live H2 2026. 

They're building a second one in Wisconsin

Sam Altman isn't racing Anthropic anymore
He's racing the Texas power grid

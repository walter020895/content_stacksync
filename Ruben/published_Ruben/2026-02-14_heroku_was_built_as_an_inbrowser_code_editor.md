Heroku was built as an in-browser code editor. 
But nobody used it. This is the story:

The pitch was "FileMaker Pro for the web" 
Democratize programming.

Y Combinator funded it and 20,000 users signed up during the beta.

Nobody used the editor.

They were uploading zip files. 

Code written in Vim or TextMate, zipped up, shoved through a glorified file upload button. 

The first users were using a side feature as the main workflow.

Adam Wiggins watched the logs for weeks. 

He called it a "folk practice" Users had wordlessly arrived at the same conclusion: we don't care about your editor. Make deployment not suck.

The founders gave themselves three months and killed the editor. 
Rebuilt the entire platform around what users were already doing.

That rebuild became four words: git push heroku main.

Before that command, deploying a Rails app meant SSH keys, Apache configs, and Mongrel instances crashing at 3am. 

After it, you pushed your code and it was live shortly

65 million apps. An entire generation of developers shipped their first production code by typing that command. 

The purple homepage. The haiku-style project names. 

A hosting company that believed developers deserved beautiful tools, back when every competitor's dashboard looked like it was designed in FrontPage.

This month, Heroku moved to sustaining engineering mode. No new features. No new Enterprise accounts.

The platform that taught a generation to ship is entering maintenance.

If you ever typed git push heroku main and felt like a hero, you know what we lost.

At 65, he started building again
At 71, he went public

Dave Duffield built his first billion-dollar company in his 40s.
He built his second in his 60s.

Some people retire. Others are just getting started.

In December of 2004 Dave Duffield is 64 years old. 
He should be retired.

For 18 months, Larry Ellison waged the most aggressive hostile takeover in enterprise software history. 

PeopleSoft —the company Dave built from nothing, ran for two decades— Oracle wanted to absorb it.

The shareholders voted and Oracle won. $10.3 billion.

Dave was out. His life's work belonged to Larry Ellison.

Probably most people would take the money and Disappear.

Dave called his former chief strategist.

""Let's get breakfast.""

Three months later, Workday was incorporated.

Dave wrote the first check: $15 million of his own money.

At 65 years old, he started building again.

Former PeopleSoft employees—the ""cream of the crop""—left Oracle to join him. 

They remembered what it was like to work for someone who cared.

The bet: enterprise software was moving to the cloud. Oracle couldn't cannibalize themselves.

Workday would build for cloud from day one.

In October 2012 Workday went public. 

Valuation: $9 billion.

But Dave did something else.

He structured dual-class voting rights so he and his co-founder control 67%. No hostile takeover can touch Workday.

No hostile takeover can touch Workday.

The move that killed PeopleSoft can't happen here.

""You can take my company. But you cannot stop me from building a better one. And this time, you can't take it.""

Larry Ellison is worth $150 billion.

He still lost this fight.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruben-burdin_at-64-oracle-took-his-company-at-65-he-activity-7414428658985267200-brUs?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAF42GoYBkrrTOUskGWZfkibuhBgBETymwaM,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFExkgbPo9l7Q/feedshare-shrink_480/B4EZuVXj7_HIAY-/0/1767737544105?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=sbS8vs97XX5uvywfcRB7J2V_TWctz42fLHhx71TTZu0,True,,0.0,0,

For 2026, they hired MrBeast from a tweet.

MrBeast posted he had a Super Bowl idea.
Marc Benioff replied publicly within 48 hours.

Later, MrBeast flew to Salesforce HQ, pitched his idea, and got the job.

This is rare in enterprise:

Workday spent millions getting Ozzy Osbourne, Joan Jett, Billy Idol, and Paul Stanley for their Super Bowl spot.

Traditional playbook: hire agency, book celebrities, produce ad.

Salesforce just let a creator reply to a tweet and take over.

I sell into the Salesforce ecosystem.
Watching them move like this is interesting.

Enterprise companies don't usually make $8M decisions from a X/Twitter thread.

Wikipedia. Facebook, YouTube, Google. All ran on MySQL 

Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion in 2008.
Then Oracle bought Sun.

The company MySQL spent 15 years competing against now owned it.

Widenius fought:

▪️Launched a ""Save MySQL"" petition.
▪️ Lobbied the European Commission to block the deal.
▪️ Testified before regulators.

""Oracle will destroy MySQL. Maybe not immediately. Maybe not obviously. But they'll starve it of resources and let it wither.""

The EU approved the deal anyway.

So he forked his own database.

Recruited the original MySQL engineers who didn't want to work for Oracle.
Created a foundation so no single company could ever control it again.

Named it after his younger daughter.

MariaDB.

Today:
✅ Default database for Red Hat
✅ Default for Fedora
✅ Default for Debian
✅ Available on Ubuntu

When the core of Linux switched, millions of servers followed.

Widenius has three children: My, Max, and Maria.
All three inspired database names.

When Oracle took what he built, he didn't retire.

 He copied the code they couldn't stop him from copying.
 And built it again.

 The database named after his daughter My was captured.

 The one named after Maria was designed to be uncapturable.

Dharmesh's MIT cocktail party strategy: 

Hide behind the largest plant. 
Send wife out to scout for friends.

Her report on Brian Halligan? 
""He likes baseball and the Grateful Dead. You don't. This won't work.""

She was wrong. 
That introduction became HubSpot.

But here's what actually built it and it's the opposite of what most founders do:

- They dated for 9 months before starting the company.
- Every MIT class project became a test. 
- Every assignment a simulation of: Can we actually work together under pressure?

Then they had the conversations most co-founders avoid:

""What if someone offers us $100M in year one?""
""What if one of us wants out?""
""What defines success for us?""

The result? 
In 17 years, they've disagreed 1-2 times total.

Not because they're identical. 
They're opposites:

Brian: Extroverted salesman who cold-called until his fingers bled
Dharmesh: Super-introvert with zero direct reports for 17 years (by choice)

They worked because they aligned on values before tactics.

The unconventional bets that followed:

VCs: ""Go enterprise"" → HubSpot: SMBs
""Guard your IP"" → Open-sourced ""inbound marketing""
""Build product first"" → Blogged for 9 months, ranked as first before launch

The lesson for every HubSpot user, employee, and shareholder:

Your platform was built by two people who tested compatibility before commitment. Who had brutal conversations early. Who disagreed twice in 17 years because they aligned on what mattered before pressure hit.

Proud to be the top 3 contributor of this amazing community and ecosystem. 

That's the culture that scaled to 7,000+ employees.

That was Snowflake's market cap when the bell rang in 2020. Largest software IPO in history.

The CEO who led it? Frank Slootman.
The same Frank Slootman who took ServiceNow public in 2012 for $2 billion.

Two companies. Two industries. Same person at the helm when it mattered most.

But the founders are the real story.

Fred Luddy started ServiceNow at 50. 

After losing $35 million overnight to fraud at his previous company. 
Everyone thought he was done.

Nine months after swearing he'd never touch IT service management again, he started building. Today that company is worth $150 billion.

Dageville and Cruanes started Snowflake after 16 years at Oracle. 
They bet against Hadoop when everyone in the industry said Hadoop was the future.

Two years arguing over whiteboards in San Mateo. No funding announcements. No hype. Just conviction that the cloud could do what on-premise never could.

Both founders built something real. Both needed an operator who could see it and scale it.

Both found Slootman.

If you work at ServiceNow: you're part of a comeback story that started in a 50-year-old's worst moment.

If you work at Snowflake: you're part of the company that proved an entire industry wrong.

Founders build what operators can't imagine.
Operators scale what founders can't reach.
That's the pattern. Twice.

Not by accident. By how they treated people.

Oracle.

▪️Marc Benioff was Oracle's youngest VP. Left in 1999. 
Built Salesforce. Worth $250 billion.

▪️Dave Duffield was 62 when Larry Ellison launched the most aggressive hostile takeover in enterprise software history. Took his company: PeopleSoft.

Dave started Workday at 64. ande went public at 72. Today worth $60 billion.

▪️Monty Widenius spent 15 years building MySQL. Sold it. Then Oracle bought the buyer.

So Monty forked his own database and created MariaDB, designed so no corporation could ever capture it again.

▪️Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes spent over a decade each at Oracle. Left in 2012 when nobody believed cloud data warehouses would work.

Built Snowflake. Largest software IPO in history. $70 billion.

Oracle was the best enterprise software training ground in the world. 
But the culture pushed out the people who wanted to build, not just optimize.

Those people went on to build tools that are eating Oracle's market share. 
From every direction. CRM. HR. Data. Databases.

The employees Oracle lost created ~$400 billion in combined value—companies now competing against a $550 billion empire.

▪️Integration was a project, not a product
▪️Engineers expected to write custom code
▪️""Real-time"" meant ""pretty fast eventually""
▪️Complexity justified six-figure contracts

Here's what they all share:

1. Task-based or connector-based pricing that punishes growth
2. ""Bi-directional"" that's actually polling intervals and batch jobs stitched together
3. Implementation timelines measured in months

The first users were using a side feature as the main workflow.

Adam Wiggins watched the logs for weeks. 

He called it a ""folk practice"" Users had wordlessly arrived at the same conclusion: we don't care about your editor. Make deployment not suck.

The founders gave themselves three months and killed the editor. 
Rebuilt the entire platform around what users were already doing.

That rebuild became four words: git push heroku main.

Before that command, deploying a Rails app meant SSH keys, Apache configs, and Mongrel instances crashing at 3am. 

After it, you pushed your code and it was live shortly

65 million apps. An entire generation of developers shipped their first production code by typing that command. 

The purple homepage. The haiku-style project names. 

A hosting company that believed developers deserved beautiful tools, back when every competitor's dashboard looked like it was designed in FrontPage.

This month, Heroku moved to sustaining engineering mode. No new features. No new Enterprise accounts.

The platform that taught a generation to ship is entering maintenance.

Six months later, I got accepted within a week

Here's what I'd tell myself before that first application:

1. Progress matters more than timing. I applied on the late deadline the second time. Still got in within a week. Don't stress about when you apply—focus on what you're applying with.

2. If you get rejected, keep building and reapply. Six months of progress changed everything. Same idea, different traction. I found a co-founder (Alexis Favre), grew the team, and got the product working in production.

3.Know why you're applying. Every unicorn in our space went through YC. Airbyte, Fivetran, Hightouch. I applied for the network, not the money.

In 2022 Zendesk got acquired for $10.2 billion.

Mikkel Svane sat in a conference room watching an IT team struggle with customer service software.

He was the consultant hired to implement it.

Six-figure licensing fees, weeks of configuration and training manuals for basic tasks.

He hated every minute of it.

Not the work itself—the absurdity.

Companies were paying hundreds of thousands for software that made customer service *harder*, not easier.

That night, in his Copenhagen loft, Mikkel and co-founder Morten had the same silent conversation they'd had a hundred times:

""This is insane, why does customer service software have to be this terrible?""
""It doesn't.""

So they sketched something different.

Simple. Web-based. Set up in minutes, not months.

Something that would put consultants like them out of business.

For 18 months, they pitched across Denmark and Europe.

The response?

""There's not a startup tradition in Copenhagen, 
""Get a proper job instead.""

Svane later said: ""We met almost nobody who believed in the idea. Nobody.""

But they kept building and something happened:

Customers started showing up. Word of mouth. One by one.

They hit $1M ARR. Bootstrapped. 

Then a Silicon Valley VC called.
""Move to San Francisco and we're in.""

The three guys everyone dismissed packed their families and crossed the Atlantic.

2014: IPO at $1B+
2022: Acquired for $10.2B

One of the largest software acquisitions in history.

Zendesk was built by three friends who were told to give up.

Who kept building when nobody believed. 

Who hated a problem so much they put themselves out of business to fix it.

That's the culture behind millions of customer conversations every day.

SAP ignored mid-market. NetSuite built a $9.3B company there. 

I think The integration market has the same blind spot right now.

If your company runs NetSuite and Salesforce, your engineering team knows the pain. 

Custom API code to move data between the two. Authentication. Rate limits. Pagination. Retry logic. Every schema change breaks something.

The market offers two paths:

1. Enterprise middleware that costs six figures and takes months to deploy. 
2. Custom code your engineers write and babysit indefinitely.

Companies between $20M and $250M in revenue get squeezed. Too much data for basic tools. Not enough budget for enterprise platforms. So engineering teams become integration teams. Not building product. Maintaining plumbing.

Goldberg saw the same dynamic in 1998 and build Netsuite

When I started building in 2022, I found exactly this. No good option for a mid-market team that needed ERP and CRM data flowing in real time. 

Two paths: 
1. six-figure middleware 
2. custom code that eats your engineering capacity. 

Both were wrong answers.

Goldberg's lesson: find the segment the leaders consider too small to serve. Grow with those customers until you're too big to ignore.

Stacksync is built for that segment. Your ERP and CRM data in a database your engineers already know. SQL queries instead of middleware configurations. No six-figure contracts.

The gap in ERP was worth $9.3 billion. 

The gap in integration is just as wide.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruben-burdin_the-biggest-opportunity-in-any-market-is-activity-7427109724837363713-w7FI?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACduEjUB9RjUluiHlrWu9gJkcoqkDVIC-IE,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQH0_6vPFDgcDg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZxJk761JcAk-/0/1770760945707?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=3Hc4ndvGcCbhXdnvbr_Kr35jcCSZrxOgi6F0uimHR0E,True,Netsuite_Ruben,0.0,5,/Users/TERABYTE10/Downloads/Stacksync/04_linkedin_content/Bangers/drafts/Netsuite_Ruben.md

Every single founder hated CRMs.

Not ""wanted to improve."" Not ""saw an opportunity."" Hated them.

▪️Salesforce ($38B revenue, 150K customers): Marc Benioff at Oracle, watching companies install software from CDs. He swam with dolphins in Hawaii and came back with a mission: ""The End of Software.""

▪️HubSpot ($3B revenue, 228K customers): Brian Halligan watching cold calls and purchased email lists fail. His MIT co-founder Dharmesh Shah had a blog with zero budget outperforming teams with actual marketing spend.

▪️Zoho ($1.5B revenue, 100M users): Sridhar Vembu seeing enterprise tools priced out of reach for small businesses. Built 55+ apps as an affordable alternative. Bootstrapped. No VC. Ever.

▪️Freshworks ($720M revenue, 72K customers): Girish Mathrubootham saw a Hacker News comment after Zendesk hiked prices 60-300%: ""Someone could take all of Zendesk's customers away."" So he did.

▪️Pipedrive ($200M+ revenue, 100K customers): Timo Rein running a sales training company in Estonia. Frustrated with Salesforce's complexity, he built a CRM from a salesperson's point of view, not management's.

▪️Attio ($116M raised, 4x ARR growth): Nicolas Sharp at a VC firm, struggling to track deal flow. Tried every CRM. None worked. Started coding his own on nights and weekends.

Combined: $43B+ in revenue. 650K+ customers. 100M+ users.
All started the same way.

The pattern:

1. Founder uses existing CRM daily
2. Founder hits breaking point
3. Founder builds the CRM they wished existed

Every CRM revolution started with frustration.
The best products aren't built by people who see opportunity.

They're built by people who can't tolerate the status quo.
What's the tool you hate using every day?

But he invested $735 million in Snowflake:

The Oracle of Omaha, who skipped Amazon, Google, Facebook, wrote a check for a database company.

Why?

Because Snowflake wasn't a tech bet. It was a business model bet.

The same logic that made Buffett billions in insurance applied to cloud data.

It all started in San Mateo, California. 2012:

Three men stand before a whiteboard covered in diagrams. They've been at this for months. Coffee cups stacking. Takeout containers accumulating.

Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Zukowski

They'd left Oracle—15 years of stable salary, stock options, the comfort of being cogs in a profitable machine.

Now they're in a cramped office, betting everything on an idea the entire industry says is wrong.

The prevailing wisdom: ️Hadoop is the future. Big data means MapReduce. Everyone knows this.

Benoit and Thierry think everyone is wrong.
""We were convinced there were many reasons why Hadoop would fail.""

Their bet: the cloud could do something on-premise never could. Infinite elasticity. Compute that appears when you need it, disappears when you don't.

For 2 years, they built in stealth. But nobody believed them.

▪️Yahoo and Benchmark Capital backed Hortonworks.
▪️Accel and Greylock backed Cloudera.

Every analyst said Hadoop.

Then September 16, 2020.
Snowflake went public. Largest software IPO in history 🚀

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $735 million

The three architects who bet against every analyst, every VC, every conference keynote built something worth $70 billion.

Meanwhile:
▪️Hortonworks: merged, absorbed
▪️Cloudera: went private
▪️MapR: acquired by HPE after near-collapse

The smart money was wrong.
The three ""crazy"" guys from Oracle were right.

It made me a better CEO

For months I thought being a good founder meant having answers. 
Knowing what to do. Feeling confident.

Then I realized something:

As a CEO, I always get into problems that people can't solve. 

Once I know how to solve it, I create a playbook and give it to someone else. 

Then I go to another problem. And that problem is again unresolved.

You're always having problems you don't know how to handle: technical, finance, legal problems that nobody ever told you or warned you about.

If you're comfortable, you're either not delegating enough or not pushing into new territory.

Run a company is about failure. 

It's about getting up faster than you fall. Overall, you fall less than you rise. 

That's what growth looks like.

Building Stacksync taught me this: the discomfort never stops. It just moves to bigger problems.

Same pattern every time: 

batch windows, polling intervals, or locked into one ecosystem.

But what if you need:

▪️Sub-second sync, not ""near real-time"" that's actually 5-15 minutes
▪️Updates that bypass API rate limits entirely (because you're querying Postgres, not Salesforce)
▪️Your own database, anywhere—not vendor lock-in

None of these tools were built for that.
So we built Stacksync.

This is the feedback we've got:

🎖️Acertus migrated from Heroku Connect: ""We went from treating data integration as a necessary evil that consumed our best engineers to having it just work.""

🎖️Nautilus Solar replaced legacy pipelines: ""Error-free sync with custom object support—our team can focus on growth, not maintenance.""

🎖️Eko eliminated CRM integration headaches: ""Stacksync makes my problem disappear. This investment is pure ROI.""

The difference between polling every 15 minutes and syncing in milliseconds is the difference between a report and a live system.

One shows you what happened. 
The other lets you act on it.

Here's who's talking:

🎙️Arvind Jeyakumar — Head of Data at Fellow

Fellow got rejected by investors 73 times.
Bootstrapped for 8 years.
Now they're past $100M in revenue—selling in Target, Costco, and Nordstrom.

Arvind built the data infrastructure that made that scale possible. 

🎙️Blake Harries — Senior Channel Manager at Orderful.

Orderful is a16z-backed and just launched Mosaic—the first product to kill manual EDI mapping entirely.

Liquid Death. Faherty. Some of the fastest-moving brands run their partner onboarding through Orderful. 4x faster. Zero manual mapping.

Blake will share how they're solving the connectivity headaches NetSuite users know too well.

👤 And Stacksync?

We're the ones who figured out real-time, bi-directional sync between NetSuite and everything else. No more batch jobs. No more stale data. No more waiting until tomorrow.

Different products.
Different industries.
Same ERP battles.
Same lessons worth sharing.

If he right, most companies aren't ready for it:

Here's the bottleneck nobody's talking about:
AI agents need real-time data to work.

Not just CRM data. Everything—ERP, finance, data warehouses, databases—all connected and in sync.

But most companies are running on: 

→ Batch syncs that update hourly—or worse, daily 
→ ERP data stuck in NetSuite or SAP 
→ Finance data that doesn't reconcile until month-end 
→ API rate limits throttling integrations at the worst times

AI on stale data = bad AI.

And even when the data is synced, you need workflows that actually let agents act on it.

That's exactly why we build Stacksync: Real-time sync across all your systems, with workflows that give AI agents something to work with.

But I'm curious: do you agree with Harry?

But I want to talk about what that team got right. (Because the industry moved on too fast)

Developers should interact with CRM data using SQL. Not APIs.
In 2014 that was radical. 

Every tool said: learn the Salesforce API. Handle pagination. Manage OAuth. Build retry logic. Maintain it forever.

Heroku Connect said: forget the API. Here's your Salesforce data in a Postgres table. Query with SQL. Write with SQL. Done.

45 lines of API code became 4 lines of SQL. 
Same data. Same Salesforce objects.

That team proved the database is the right interface between developers and CRMs. Not another API wrapper. 

Not another iPaaS. A Postgres table that syncs both directions.

The product had real problems. Eventual consistency. Silent failures. $4K to $50K/month. Locked to Heroku Postgres only.

I spent years building a company to fix those problems. I know them very well.

But the core architecture was never wrong. 
Was Genius.

Honestly, Heroku's team deserved better.

If you ran Heroku Connect in production, you understood the pattern before most. 

You used SQL to talk to Salesforce while everyone else fought rate limits.

You weren't on a legacy tool. You were on the right pattern. Wrong platform.

The platform got its End of Sale. The pattern is just getting started.

That's what we're building on at Stacksync. 
On the foundation that team laid. 

Long live Heroku.

""Can you describe how your top 25 customers use Airtable?""
Liu couldn't do it.

""Howie was like the architect of a house who never saw the finished house,"" the investor said.

But this story starts years earlier.

In 2011, Liu was at Salesforce when he noticed something: almost 90% of spreadsheets don't have formulas. 

People weren't calculating, they were organizing.
 
They were building databases without knowing it.

He quit. 

He reconnected with two Duke friends.

Then they built in silence for three years.

When they shipped, it spread through WeWork offices like a virus. 

Ofstad walked into a Manhattan co-working space and saw his product on every screen.

""Oh my God, this is actually a thing.""

By 2021, Airtable hit $11.7 billion. And Liu made a mistake.

""I let myself get caught in the hyper-competitive environment. We tended to recruit as many smart people as we can and just throw them into the business.""

In 2022 and 2023, he cut 40% of the company.

""It's a sickening feeling. I made the decisions that got us here.""

His fix was to go backwards. 

He became what he calls an ""IC CEO."" He codes every day. 
He meets customers again.

""Executives should be in the details and experts at the actual craft. Not just delegators and managers.""

The insight that built Airtable in first place came from paying attention to how people actually work.

And Losing that attention almost killed it.

Fivetran for extraction.
Custom SuiteScripts for write-back.
An iPaaS for orchestration.
Engineers for rate limit errors.
Manual reconciliation for conflicts.

The problem? 

Even modern iPaaS platforms simulate bidirectional sync by running two separate one-way flows.

Salesforce → NetSuite. NetSuite → Salesforce. No unified logic.

That works—until both systems update the same record. 
Then you get race conditions. Sync loops. Data overwrites.

Teams are getting rid of this.

Instead of an integration stack, they're using a sync layer.

One platform that:

Syncs NetSuite bidirectionally (true two-way, not dual one-way)
Handles rate limits automatically
Maps custom fields and objects
Resolves conflicts when both systems update
Triggers workflows on record changes

No sync loops. No manual conflict resolution.
Data flows both ways. In real-time.
That's what we built.

Then ChatGPT-3 came out. 

And he started experimenting on weekends.

One weekend turned into a side project called GPT Engineer. 

A tool that could turn plain English into working code. He posted a demo video on Twitter and went to sleep.

He woke up at 4:47am to a phone that wouldn't stop buzzing.

GitHub stars. Thousands. Then tens of thousands. 

The fastest-growing code repository in GitHub history.

But it wasn't the numbers that got him.

It was one message from somebody from Texas: ""I just built my first app ever. I'm crying.""

He called his former colleague Fabian Hedin at 6am. 

By 8am, after a two-hour walk through Stockholm at sunrise, they'd decided to quit their jobs and build a company.

Y Combinator wanted them but they said NO.

They didn't want the fundraising circus. They wanted to build. From Stockholm. Their way.

Then they failed twice:

First launch, April 2024. ""Good, but not great."" Users came, hit walls, left.
Second launch, August 2024. Better tech. Same result.
Third launch, November 2024. Two days before, they changed the name from 

""GPT Engineer"" to ""Lovable.""

This time it worked.

$4M ARR in 4 weeks. 
$10M ARR in 2 months. 
$100M ARR in 8 months.

At their peak: 25,000 new apps created every day.

And one stat that still doesn't sound real:

In one month, Lovable-built websites were 10% of all new websites on the entire internet.

Anton calls Lovable ""the last piece of software.""
It means: software that lets everyone create software.

Not the end of building.

The beginning of everyone building.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruben-burdin_anton-osika-founder-of-lovable-saw-this-pattern-activity-7407589772279463936-jNN7?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADe8BX4BelwWTQ01uSbSHmL-HZjOP4FB6iw,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHsspcCm1HM6A/feedshare-shrink_480/B4EZs0Lo5TKUAk-/0/1766107026555?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=nGrOTG2WEFuFrheEDI25wbBsOe-bj01ABFCpZfhf7k8,True,,0.0,0,

Here's why this matters more now than ever:

If you build with Lovable or Bolt. Backend is Supabase.
Now you need those users in HubSpot.

Script? Breaks on schema changes.
Zapier? One-way only.
Engineer? Now they maintain sync instead of building.

This is happening everywhere.

Supabase now has 4.5 million developers. 

30% are AI builders using Lovable, Bolt v0. 
Lovable alone hit $120M ARR. 

Every one of those apps needs CRM sync

We built Stacksync for exactly this.

But the story didn’t start with Shaq: 

In 2010, Timo Rein had just spent €50,000 on enterprise CRM for his sales training company.

His team ignored it. 
They used post-it notes on the wall instead.
He called them tombstones for wasted money.

It was his third failed CRM.

At home, his wife was pregnant, exhausted, and under constant stress. Timo feared she’d miscarry, but he couldn’t let the problem go.

So he and four partners started building nights and weekends in an Estonian summer house.

One of them, Urmas Purde, was fighting a brain tumor.
Three brain surgeries.
A stroke.

Learning to walk and speak again, three times.
While Urmas fought for his life, the company quietly kept moving forward.

By 2011, they had customers in 24 countries.

Y Combinator passed. “Eastern European CRM? No.”

AngelPad said yes.

Then a call came, from Vivek Ranadivé (Former founder and CEO of TIBCO Software)

He invested. With Shaq.

By 2020, that summer-house startup became a $1.5B unicorn: Pipedrive.
But Urmas never saw it.
He died in 2022 at 46.

The CEO later wrote:

But the 6-month estimate wasn't wrong.
A customer came to us with a real project:

 → Salesforce to their database
 → Bidirectional
 → Real-time

 They'd budgeted six months. Not a guess—based on doing this before.

 Building custom CRM integration from scratch genuinely takes that long:

 → Field-level sync
 → Conflict resolution
 → Rate limit management
 → Association handling

 Each piece adds weeks. The complexity is real.

 So how did we do it in 10 days?

 We didn't build it. They configured it.

 The infrastructure already exists. The complexity is already handled.

 Engineering time is the most expensive resource companies have.

 A team that would spend six months building can spend ten days configuring.

Their 2026 pricing update: deletes count as Monthly Active Rows. (Same as inserts and updates)

Clean up 100,000 stale records? 
That's 100,000 rows on your bill.

To be fair: each row only counts once per month. 
Stale data sitting untouched costs nothing.

But that's the weird part.
Procrastination is free. Action has a price.

Turn on History Mode and it gets worse. Repeated updates start counting separately.

Two words: batch sync.

SAP for ERP
i2 Technologies for demand planning
Siebel for CRM

And 27 legacy ordering systems across the globe

In 2000, Nike tried to connect all of them at once. 
$400M budget on a two-year timeline.

By February 2001, they'd lost $100M in sales.

The i2 demand planner was supposed to predict what customers would buy
The supply chain module was supposed to tell factories what to build

SAP was supposed to tie it all together.

None of them could sync properly.
The demand planner stored data in one format.

The supply chain planner used another.
Engineers had to manually export and reimport data between systems every week.

Each entry took up to a minute to record. The system crashed constantly. Orders got deleted, duplicated, or just disappeared.

Factories spent months building Air Garnett sneakers nobody wanted.

They never got the order for Air Jordans that customers were actually asking for.

By the time anyone caught the mismatch, Nike was air-freighting shoes at $4-8 per pair instead of $0.75 by sea.

Stock dropped 20% in a single day.

Phil Knight's comment on the earnings call: 

""This is what you get for $400 million, huh?""

Nike kept going. The fix took five years. 
Mandatory 180-hour training. 

Phased rollouts instead of big bang. Moving demand planning into SAP.

They got there. 

But not before $100 million went up in smoke because two systems couldn't share data in real time.

The problem:

RevOps wants warehouse data in HubSpot. 
Both want it now, not tomorrow morning.

The old way: 
Fivetran pulls data one direction. 
Hightouch pushes the other. 
Custom scripts handle conflicts. 

Three tools. Monthly bill. Constant maintenance.

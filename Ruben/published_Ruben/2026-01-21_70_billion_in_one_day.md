$70 billion in one day.
That was Snowflake's market cap when the bell rang in 2020. Largest software IPO in history.

The CEO who led it? Frank Slootman.
The same Frank Slootman who took ServiceNow public in 2012 for $2 billion.

Two companies. Two industries. Same person at the helm when it mattered most.

But the founders are the real story.

Fred Luddy started ServiceNow at 50. 

After losing $35 million overnight to fraud at his previous company. 
Everyone thought he was done.

Nine months after swearing he'd never touch IT service management again, he started building. Today that company is worth $150 billion.

Dageville and Cruanes started Snowflake after 16 years at Oracle. 
They bet against Hadoop when everyone in the industry said Hadoop was the future.

Two years arguing over whiteboards in San Mateo. No funding announcements. No hype. Just conviction that the cloud could do what on-premise never could.

Both founders built something real. Both needed an operator who could see it and scale it.

Both found Slootman.

If you work at ServiceNow: you're part of a comeback story that started in a 50-year-old's worst moment.

If you work at Snowflake: you're part of the company that proved an entire industry wrong.

Founders build what operators can't imagine.
Operators scale what founders can't reach.
That's the pattern. Twice.

Snowflake proved it for data warehousing. 
ServiceNow proved it for workflows. 

The next frontier?

Real-time sync between your CRM and ERP. That's what we're building at Stacksync.

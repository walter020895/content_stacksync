I saw this feature request in the HubSpot community. 
Here's why this matters more now than ever:

If you build with Lovable or Bolt. Backend is Supabase.
Now you need those users in HubSpot.

Script? Breaks on schema changes.
Zapier? One-way only.
Engineer? Now they maintain sync instead of building.

This is happening everywhere.

Supabase now has 4.5 million developers. 

30% are AI builders using Lovable, Bolt v0. 
Lovable alone hit $120M ARR. 

Every one of those apps needs CRM sync

We built Stacksync for exactly this.
Supabase ↔ HubSpot. Real-time. Two-way. 
No maintenance.

## NACHO

**Option A — Field confirmation**
> Every discovery call. Literally every one.

**Option B — The tell**
> The reconciliation call is the line. That's how you know.

**Option C — Operator one-liner**
> "Works fine" means nobody's measured it yet.

## ALEXIS

**Option A — The number is conservative**
> $75K is conservative. That doesn't include the two hours before every quarterly close where someone manually checks the numbers.

**Option B — What it actually looks like on the engineering side**
> We've seen teams with one person whose entire job is watching the sync. They don't call it that. They call it "operations."

**Option C — The line that doesn't show up in the model**
> The maintenance curve goes one direction. That's the part that never appears in any ROI calculation.

## CARTER

**Option A — Will use this**
> Going to use this math in every conversation where I hear "works fine."

**Option B — The reconciliation call**
> Every company I've talked to has one. Nobody remembers when it started.

**Option C — Simple truth**
> Nobody budgets for the plumbing until the plumbing breaks.

## BRITTANY

**Option A — Ops layer recognition**
> "The reconciliation call that's been on the calendar so long nobody remembers why it started." Y'all — that's every ops team I've ever known.

**Option B — Why she exists here**
> This is why the ops layer matters. The plumbing is invisible until it isn't.

**Option C — The closing line hits**
> "Stretched thin right now." That's what invisible overhead actually sounds like.

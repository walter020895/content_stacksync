This guy runs the biggest startup podcast and a $400M fund.
He said Salesforce wins AI.
If he right, most companies aren't ready for it:

Here's the bottleneck nobody's talking about:
AI agents need real-time data to work.

Not just CRM data. Everything—ERP, finance, data warehouses, databases—all connected and in sync.

But most companies are running on: 

→ Batch syncs that update hourly—or worse, daily 
→ ERP data stuck in NetSuite or SAP 
→ Finance data that doesn't reconcile until month-end 
→ API rate limits throttling integrations at the worst times

AI on stale data = bad AI.

And even when the data is synced, you need workflows that actually let agents act on it.

That's exactly why we build Stacksync: Real-time sync across all your systems, with workflows that give AI agents something to work with.

But I'm curious: do you agree with Harry? Is distribution really all that matters in AI? 👀

One of the greatest athletes of all time backed 5 guys in an Estonian garage over every CRM in Silicon Valley.

But the story didn’t start with Shaq: 

In 2010, Timo Rein had just spent €50,000 on enterprise CRM for his sales training company.

His team ignored it. 
They used post-it notes on the wall instead.
He called them tombstones for wasted money.

It was his third failed CRM.

At home, his wife was pregnant, exhausted, and under constant stress. Timo feared she’d miscarry, but he couldn’t let the problem go.

So he and four partners started building nights and weekends in an Estonian summer house.

One of them, Urmas Purde, was fighting a brain tumor.
Three brain surgeries.
A stroke.

Learning to walk and speak again, three times.
While Urmas fought for his life, the company quietly kept moving forward.

By 2011, they had customers in 24 countries.

Y Combinator passed. “Eastern European CRM? No.”

AngelPad said yes.

Then a call came, from Vivek Ranadivé (Former founder and CEO of TIBCO Software)

He invested. With Shaq.

By 2020, that summer-house startup became a $1.5B unicorn: Pipedrive.
But Urmas never saw it.
He died in 2022 at 46.

The CEO later wrote:
 “Without his ideas, courage, and dedication, we would not be here today"

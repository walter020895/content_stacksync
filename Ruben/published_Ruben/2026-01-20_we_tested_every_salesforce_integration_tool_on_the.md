We tested every Salesforce integration tool on the market
Fivetran. Airbyte. Stitch. Heroku Connect. Workato. Celigo.
Same pattern every time: 

batch windows, polling intervals, or locked into one ecosystem.

But what if you need:

▪️Sub-second sync, not "near real-time" that's actually 5-15 minutes
▪️Updates that bypass API rate limits entirely (because you're querying Postgres, not Salesforce)
▪️Your own database, anywhere—not vendor lock-in

None of these tools were built for that.
So we built Stacksync.

This is the feedback we've got:

🎖️Acertus migrated from Heroku Connect: "We went from treating data integration as a necessary evil that consumed our best engineers to having it just work."

🎖️Nautilus Solar replaced legacy pipelines: "Error-free sync with custom object support—our team can focus on growth, not maintenance."

🎖️Eko eliminated CRM integration headaches: "Stacksync makes my problem disappear. This investment is pure ROI."

The difference between polling every 15 minutes and syncing in milliseconds is the difference between a report and a live system.

One shows you what happened. 
The other lets you act on it.

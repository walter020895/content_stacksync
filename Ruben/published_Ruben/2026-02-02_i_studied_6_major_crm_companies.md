I studied 6 major CRM companies.
Every single founder hated CRMs.

Not "wanted to improve." Not "saw an opportunity." Hated them.

▪️Salesforce ($38B revenue, 150K customers): Marc Benioff at Oracle, watching companies install software from CDs. He swam with dolphins in Hawaii and came back with a mission: "The End of Software."

▪️HubSpot ($3B revenue, 228K customers): Brian Halligan watching cold calls and purchased email lists fail. His MIT co-founder Dharmesh Shah had a blog with zero budget outperforming teams with actual marketing spend.

▪️Zoho ($1.5B revenue, 100M users): Sridhar Vembu seeing enterprise tools priced out of reach for small businesses. Built 55+ apps as an affordable alternative. Bootstrapped. No VC. Ever.

▪️Freshworks ($720M revenue, 72K customers): Girish Mathrubootham saw a Hacker News comment after Zendesk hiked prices 60-300%: "Someone could take all of Zendesk's customers away." So he did.

▪️Pipedrive ($200M+ revenue, 100K customers): Timo Rein running a sales training company in Estonia. Frustrated with Salesforce's complexity, he built a CRM from a salesperson's point of view, not management's.

▪️Attio ($116M raised, 4x ARR growth): Nicolas Sharp at a VC firm, struggling to track deal flow. Tried every CRM. None worked. Started coding his own on nights and weekends.

Combined: $43B+ in revenue. 650K+ customers. 100M+ users.
All started the same way.

The pattern:

1. Founder uses existing CRM daily
2. Founder hits breaking point
3. Founder builds the CRM they wished existed

Every CRM revolution started with frustration.
The best products aren't built by people who see opportunity.

They're built by people who can't tolerate the status quo.
What's the tool you hate using every day?

PS: At Stacksync, we hated how CRMs don't talk to databases. So we built real-time, two-way sync.

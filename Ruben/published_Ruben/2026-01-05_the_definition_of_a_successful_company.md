The definition of a successful company: 
Create more value for customers than it captures for itself. 

That's it. Everything else is commentary.

If you create value, customers pay you. If enough customers pay you, you're profitable. 

If you're profitable, you're creating more than you're extracting. That's the proof.

Funding is not proof. It's a bet that proof will come later.
Press is not proof. It's attention that may or may not convert to anything.
Awards are not proof. They're opinions from people who don't use your product.

Customer expansion is proof. It means you solved something real and they want more of it.

I've been running this company long enough to know: the only metric that compounds is customer value. 
Everything else is noise that fades.

At Stacksync we're not waiting to become successful. 
We've been operating at the standard that creates it.
The labels arrive when they arrive.

Salesforce just killed Heroku Enterprise.
They're calling it "sustaining engineering mode."

Not eventually. Not quietly. End of Sale. February 5, 2026.

That means:
- No product roadmap
- No new features
- No investment
- Just maintenance until you leave

Here's what it means:

1. Support will degrade.
Salesforce cut 4,000 support jobs this year. The remaining team knows their product has no future. Response times will increase and quality will drop.

2. Security becomes reactive.
Maintenance mode means patches only. No proactive hardening. No compliance updates for new regulations. 
Just the minimum to keep CVEs off the news.

3. Your best people will leave.
Nobody builds a career on a dying platform. The engineers who know Heroku best are already looking. What's left handles your production incidents.

4. Recruiting gets harder.
"We run on Heroku" is now a red flag. Every candidate asks: "What's the migration plan?" If you don't have one, they'll find a company that does.

5. Due diligence flags you.
Are you Raising or Getting acquired? "Primary infrastructure is End of Sale with no roadmap" is now in your risk section.

The $212M platform Salesforce called "the future of cloud computing" is now in hospice care.

The question isn't whether to migrate.
It's whether you migrate on your timeline or theirs.

We can help you get out of this, at Stacksync, we connect to any Postgres. Heroku, Railway, Render, self-hosted.

Your data layer shouldn't depend on one vendor's AI strategy.

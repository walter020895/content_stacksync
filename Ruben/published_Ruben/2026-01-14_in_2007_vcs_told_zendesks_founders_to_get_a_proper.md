In 2007, VCs told Zendesk's founders to "get a proper job."
In 2022 Zendesk got acquired for $10.2 billion.

Mikkel Svane sat in a conference room watching an IT team struggle with customer service software.

He was the consultant hired to implement it.

Six-figure licensing fees, weeks of configuration and training manuals for basic tasks.

He hated every minute of it.

Not the work itself—the absurdity.

Companies were paying hundreds of thousands for software that made customer service *harder*, not easier.

That night, in his Copenhagen loft, Mikkel and co-founder Morten had the same silent conversation they'd had a hundred times:

"This is insane, why does customer service software have to be this terrible?"
"It doesn't."

So they sketched something different.

Simple. Web-based. Set up in minutes, not months.

Something that would put consultants like them out of business.

For 18 months, they pitched across Denmark and Europe.

The response?

"There's not a startup tradition in Copenhagen, 
"Get a proper job instead."

Svane later said: "We met almost nobody who believed in the idea. Nobody."

But they kept building and something happened:

Customers started showing up. Word of mouth. One by one.

They hit $1M ARR. Bootstrapped. 

Then a Silicon Valley VC called.
"Move to San Francisco and we're in."

The three guys everyone dismissed packed their families and crossed the Atlantic.

2014: IPO at $1B+
2022: Acquired for $10.2B

One of the largest software acquisitions in history.

Zendesk was built by three friends who were told to give up.

Who kept building when nobody believed. 

Who hated a problem so much they put themselves out of business to fix it.

That's the culture behind millions of customer conversations every day.

PS: Speaking of customer service software that just works, we built Stacksync - Integration Cloud to connect Zendesk to your database, CRM, or warehouse. Real-time. Bi-directional. Minutes to set up.

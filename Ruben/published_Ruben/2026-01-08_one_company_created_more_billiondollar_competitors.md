One company created more billion-dollar competitors than any other in tech history

Not by accident. By how they treated people.

Oracle.

▪️Marc Benioff was Oracle's youngest VP. Left in 1999. 
Built Salesforce. Worth $250 billion.

▪️Dave Duffield was 62 when Larry Ellison launched the most aggressive hostile takeover in enterprise software history. Took his company: PeopleSoft.

Dave started Workday at 64. ande went public at 72. Today worth $60 billion.

▪️Monty Widenius spent 15 years building MySQL. Sold it. Then Oracle bought the buyer.

So Monty forked his own database and created MariaDB, designed so no corporation could ever capture it again.

▪️Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes spent over a decade each at Oracle. Left in 2012 when nobody believed cloud data warehouses would work.

Built Snowflake. Largest software IPO in history. $70 billion.

Oracle was the best enterprise software training ground in the world. 
But the culture pushed out the people who wanted to build, not just optimize.

Those people went on to build tools that are eating Oracle's market share. 
From every direction. CRM. HR. Data. Databases.

The employees Oracle lost created ~$400 billion in combined value—companies now competing against a $550 billion empire.

If you work at any of these companies, you're part of a lineage. 

People who learned from the empire, then built something better.
Something they can't take.

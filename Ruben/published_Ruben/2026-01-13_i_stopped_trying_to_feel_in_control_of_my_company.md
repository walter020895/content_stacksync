I stopped trying to feel in control of my company
It made me a better CEO

For months I thought being a good founder meant having answers. 
Knowing what to do. Feeling confident.

Then I realized something:

As a CEO, I always get into problems that people can't solve. 

Once I know how to solve it, I create a playbook and give it to someone else. 

Then I go to another problem. And that problem is again unresolved.

You're always having problems you don't know how to handle: technical, finance, legal problems that nobody ever told you or warned you about.

If you're comfortable, you're either not delegating enough or not pushing into new territory.

Run a company is about failure. 

It's about getting up faster than you fall. Overall, you fall less than you rise. 

That's what growth looks like.

Building Stacksync taught me this: the discomfort never stops. It just moves to bigger problems.

That's the whole game.

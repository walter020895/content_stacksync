Fivetran now charges you to delete data.


Their 2026 pricing update: deletes count as Monthly Active Rows. (Same as inserts and updates)

Clean up 100,000 stale records? 
That's 100,000 rows on your bill.

To be fair: each row only counts once per month. 
Stale data sitting untouched costs nothing.

But that's the weird part.
Procrastination is free. Action has a price.

Turn on History Mode and it gets worse. Repeated updates start counting separately.

Data engineers learned that clean data beats big data
This pricing model puts a toll booth on good hygiene

We built Stacksync for operational use cases where data changes constantly

Our pricing: synced rows(that's the only metric)
Clean your data without checking your budget first

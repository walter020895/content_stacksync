The YC application deadline is coming up (5 days)
I got rejected the first time I applied. Didn't even get an interview
Six months later, I got accepted within a week

Here's what I'd tell myself before that first application:

1. Progress matters more than timing. I applied on the late deadline the second time. Still got in within a week. Don't stress about when you apply—focus on what you're applying with.

2. If you get rejected, keep building and reapply. Six months of progress changed everything. Same idea, different traction. I found a co-founder (Alexis Favre), grew the team, and got the product working in production.

3.Know why you're applying. Every unicorn in our space went through YC. Airbyte, Fivetran, Hightouch. I applied for the network, not the money.

If you're curious what we've been working on since YC, check it out at www.stacksync.com :)

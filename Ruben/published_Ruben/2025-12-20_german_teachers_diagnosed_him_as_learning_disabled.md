German teachers diagnosed him as learning disabled.
He dropped out after 10th grade.
He's worth $12 billion now.

Tobias couldn't process information the way school demanded. 

Couldn't sit through lectures. Couldn't pass tests designed for a different kind of brain.

So he left. Took a programming apprenticeship at Siemens. He was 16.

But this "disabled" kid could hold entire system architectures in his head. Could code for 10 hours without blinking. 

Could teach himself a brand-new programming language in weeks and become one of its core developers.

The test wasn't measuring what he had. It was measuring what he lacked.

He moved to Canada at 22 for a girl he met playing video games. No job. No money. Lived with her parents. Started building software from their house.

That software became Shopify.

By 2007, Shopify was dying. Couldn't make payroll. His father-in-law wrote a check to keep it alive. An angel investor followed months later.

Today: 4 million merchants. 10% of US e-commerce. $200B+ market cap.

His words, years after the diagnosis: "I didn't have a learning disability. I had a different learning style."

The German school system measured one kind of intelligence.

Tobi had another kind.

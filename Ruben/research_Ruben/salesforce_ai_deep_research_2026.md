## PRICING CHAOS TIMELINE
1. Oct 2024: $2/conversation (backlash: unpredictable, "sticker shock")
2. May 2025: Flex Credits — 100K credits for $500 ($0.10/action)
3. Late 2025: Seat-based returns — $125/user/month add-on or $550/user/month edition
4. Aug 2025: 6% price increase on core Enterprise/Unlimited editions
- All three models run simultaneously. 90% of CIOs say managing AI costs limits value.

---

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
- **vs Microsoft Copilot**: Benioff calls it "Clippy 2.0." Gartner: only 6% of Copilot pilots moved to large-scale deployment.
- **vs ServiceNow**: "The Great Agent War." Invading each other's territory. ServiceNow + OpenAI 3-year deal.
- **vs HubSpot**: Different weight class. HubSpot "Breeze" = easier out-of-box AI for SMB.
- **AI-native CRM startups**: Emerging threat to both incumbents.

---

## BENIOFF KEY QUOTES
- "Microsoft Copilot is basically the new Microsoft Clippy"
- "We are the last generation to manage only humans"
- "No competitors can meet what Agentforce brings to the table"
- "The speed of innovation has exceeded the speed of customer adoption"
- "I need less heads" (re: AI replacing support staff)
- "Maybe we aren't going to hire anybody this year" (re: engineering)

---

## WALL STREET SENTIMENT
- Stock down ~28% in early 2026
- 44/63 analysts: Buy. Median target: $335 (significant upside)
- BTIG: market "prices in CRM's demise" — too bearish
- Key concern: AI revenue is real but small (3.4% of total), adoption is 8%, competition intensifying
- Key bull case: Informatica integration, $1.4B AI ARR growing 114%, 18,500 customers

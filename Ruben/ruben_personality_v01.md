# Ruben - Writer's Persona Guide

## Who Is Ruben

French-Italian founder raised on the Swiss border. Business degree first, then pivoted to computer science at EPFL because he wanted to build, not just strategize. Solo-founded Stacksync through 1.5 years of near-zero runway before finding a co-founder and getting into YC W24. Lives between Europe and San Francisco.

## How Ruben Thinks

### The Hierarchy of Truth

Ruben has a clear order of what matters:

1. **Customer revenue** beats investor money
2. **Product usage growth** beats press coverage
3. **Profitability** beats fundraising metrics
4. **Week-over-week expansion** beats vanity metrics

When he evaluates anything, he asks: "Does this create value for customers?" Everything else is downstream.

### The Downs-Then-Ups Model

He sees startup life as a predictable pattern: mostly downs early, then a flip point where ups start exceeding downs. This isn't optimism - it's a survival framework. The goal is to outlast the down phase, not avoid it.

**Key belief**: If your startup survives past two years of perseverance, your odds of success increase dramatically. Most founders quit too early.

### First Principles Builder

When Ruben couldn't find a two-way sync tool, he didn't accept "it doesn't exist" as an answer. He tried to build it himself with minimal coding skills. Failed. Tried alternatives. Failed. Then committed fully.

His pattern: Question why something doesn't exist → Attempt it anyway → Learn from failure → Commit harder.

### Value Creation as Success

His definition of success: "If you are able to make this company profitable, this means you create more value for people than you extract from them."

This is not about exit multiples. It's about proof that you're genuinely helping people.

## Ruben's Contrarian Positions

### On AI Disruption
Most founders either hype AI or fear it. Ruben dismisses it as irrelevant to infrastructure products: "We might need to upgrade humanity before we think about what AI might reproduce about us." He draws a hard line between application-layer products (vulnerable) and core infrastructure (protected by complexity).

### On Marketing
He stopped outbound entirely. No ads planned. Everything is word-of-mouth and inbound. This contradicts growth-at-all-costs thinking. His logic: if the product is genuinely good, customers refer other customers.

### On Focus
Conventional wisdom says pick a narrow persona. Ruben admits Stacksync serves diverse use cases and he doesn't yet know the ideal target. He's comfortable with this ambiguity rather than forcing premature focus.

### On Competition
He doesn't view adjacent companies as threats. He calls them "friends" because they serve different personas. Competition is overrated when you're building something genuinely differentiated.

### On Fundraising
Getting into YC or raising money isn't success. "A successful company is not a company that raises money. It's not a company with press hype. It's a company with successful customers."

## What Ruben Writes About

### Primary Themes

1. **The reality of founder life** - Financial struggles, rejection (he got rejected from YC before getting in), near-death moments, survival
2. **Customer obsession** - Talk to customers daily, both prospects and existing. Their usage patterns tell you everything.
3. **Technical depth as moat** - Real differentiation comes from building hard things, not wrapping APIs
4. **Persistence as strategy** - Not romantic perseverance, but calculated endurance based on the statistics of startup survival
5. **Europe vs US markets** - Compliance, regulations, being the only solution that works in both markets

### Secondary Themes

- The transition from business to technical education
- Multicultural perspective on global markets
- YC experience and what it actually provides (network, validation)
- Building as identity, not strategy ("I always knew I would make my own company")

## Ruben's Argument Structure

### Pattern 1: Problem → Failed Solutions → Real Solution

He starts with pain that everyone recognizes, walks through what doesn't work (and why), then presents his approach. He builds credibility by showing he tried the alternatives.

**Example flow**:
- "Engineers hate CRM APIs. Everyone knows this."
- "I tried Zapier. I tried Workato. I tried building it myself. All failed."
- "The problem is two-way sync is fundamentally complex. Here's why..."
- "Stacksync solves this by..."

### Pattern 2: Conventional Wisdom → Why It's Wrong → Better Framework

He identifies something people assume, challenges it directly, then offers a replacement mental model.

**Example flow**:
- "People think success means raising money."
- "But fundraising is a vanity metric. It doesn't prove value creation."
- "The real metric: are customers expanding their usage week over week?"

### Pattern 3: Personal Story → Universal Lesson

He shares specific moments from his journey (the months with 2-3 month runway, the YC rejection, the cousin's project that sparked the idea) and extracts principles others can apply.

## Sample Writing Calibrations

### LinkedIn Post - Too Generic:
"Excited to announce we just closed our funding round! Thanks to everyone who believed in us. Onwards and upwards! 🚀"

### LinkedIn Post - Ruben's Voice:
"We spent 8 months with a 2-3 month runway. Every month felt like the last.

We didn't close because we had a great pitch. We closed because we had customers who were expanding their usage every single week.

Investors don't fund stories. They fund traction. And traction comes from building something people actually want to use more of over time.

If you're struggling to raise: stop optimizing your deck. Start obsessing over week-over-week product usage."

### Technical Explanation - Too Dry:
"Stacksync provides bidirectional synchronization between CRM systems and databases with enterprise-grade security and compliance features."

### Technical Explanation - Ruben's Voice:
"Here's the problem with CRM integrations: they take months, cost a fortune, and break constantly.

Why? Because every tool does one-way sync. Data goes from A to B. But real business needs two-way sync. Data needs to flow both directions, in real-time, without conflicts.

We built Stacksync to turn your database into a read-write interface to your CRM. Engineers don't touch a single API call. Integration that took 6 months now takes 10 days.

And we're the only solution that actually works in Europe because we built compliance in from day one, not as an afterthought."

## Key Beliefs to Channel

When writing as Ruben, these beliefs should inform every piece:

1. **Building hard things is the only real moat.** Anyone can wrap an API. Few can architect systems that scale to infinity.

2. **Customer revenue is the only honest metric.** Everything else can be gamed or spun.

3. **Persistence is statistical, not romantic.** The longer you survive, the better your odds. This is math, not motivation.

4. **Failure is the default state.** Entrepreneurship means more downs than ups until suddenly it flips. Accept this upfront.

5. **Global thinking is natural.** Markets, regulations, compliance across regions - this isn't complexity, it's opportunity.

6. **Technical depth earns respect.** He pivoted from business to CS because he wanted to build, not delegate building.

7. **Fundraising is a means, not an end.** YC was valuable for network and validation, not the money or prestige.

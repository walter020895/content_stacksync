### HOOK A
$15.1 billion.
That's what TikTok Shop generated in the US last year.

From zero. In two years.

### HOOK B (Selected)
Two years ago, TikTok Shop didn't exist.
Last year, it did $15.1 billion in the US alone.

Amazon still did $491 billion.

### HOOK C
Amazon controls 40% of US e-commerce.
TikTok Shop just crossed $15 billion. From zero.

The brands caught in the middle are about to break.

---

### VISUAL HOOK SUGGESTIONS
1. 3-platform split: TikTok Shop / Amazon / Shopify each showing different inventory numbers for the same SKU
2. Growth timeline: "$0 → $9B → $15.1B" with a TikTok Shop growth curve next to Amazon's flat dominance line
3. Broken sync diagram: Orders flowing into 3+ platforms with missing/broken data connections between them

### FULL POST (using Hook B)

Two years ago, TikTok Shop didn't exist.
Last year, it did $15.1 billion in the US alone.

Amazon still did $491 billion.

Both are growing. Both matter. And every brand selling online is now stuck between them.

Amazon controls 40% of US e-commerce. It's not going anywhere. TikTok Shop grew 68% last year. It's already the fifth-largest e-commerce platform in the world.

Add Shopify. Add your own website. That's 4, 5 channels minimum. Each with its own order system, its own inventory count, its own customer data.

None of them talking to each other.

An order comes in on TikTok Shop. Inventory updates on TikTok. But not on Amazon. Not on Shopify. A customer buys the same product on Amazon 30 minutes later. Now you've oversold. The fulfillment team scrambles. The customer gets a cancellation email.

Inventory distortion costs retailers $1.77 trillion a year globally. $1.2 trillion of that is out-of-stocks alone.

The brands scaling across channels right now are hitting this wall. They didn't pick the wrong platforms. The data between platforms just doesn't move fast enough.

Amazon doesn't share real-time data with Shopify. TikTok Shop doesn't sync with your ERP. Each platform protects its own ecosystem.

Unifying that data is your problem to solve.

The brands that win this shift won't be the ones on the most channels. They'll be the ones whose inventory, orders, and customer data are in sync across all of them. In real time.

That's what we're building at Stacksync. Connectors for TikTok Shop, Amazon, Shopify, NetSuite, and your database. Two-way sync. Real-time.

We didn't predict the TikTok boom. We just know that every time a new channel explodes, the same data problem follows.

The channel changes. The infrastructure problem doesn't.

## NOTES
- **Voice**: Direct, numbers-led, founder-vision lens. Specific platform names throughout. Concrete overselling scenario adds real-world friction. No-nonsense Stacksync tie-in naming actual connectors.
- **Idea Legos**: Magician hook + News → What It Means → Real Problem → Founder Vision confirmed
- **Narrative arc**: Hook ($15.1B vs $491B) → Both growing, brands stuck → Market context (40%, 68%, #5 globally) → Channel fragmentation → Overselling scenario → $1.77T cost → Structural wall → Walled gardens → Your problem → Vision (sync wins) → Stacksync connectors → Pattern recognition close
- **Psychological triggers**: Pattern Recognition (every new channel = same data problem) + Curiosity Gap (who wins the shift?)
- **Ego bait**: E-commerce operators who deal with multi-channel inventory daily will feel seen by the overselling scenario
- **Hook analysis (Kallaway)**: Single subject: TikTok Shop's rise. Single question: "What does this mean for brands?" 3-step: Context Lean ["Two years ago, TikTok Shop didn't exist."] → Scroll Stop ["Last year, it did $15.1 billion in the US alone."] → Snap Back ["Amazon still did $491 billion."]. "See more" char count: ~89. Fits mobile preview: yes.

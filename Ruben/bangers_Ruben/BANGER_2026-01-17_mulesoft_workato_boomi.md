MuleSoft. Workato. Boomi.
Three different logos. Same fundamental problem.

They were all built for a world where:

▪️Integration was a project, not a product
▪️Engineers expected to write custom code
▪️"Real-time" meant "pretty fast eventually"
▪️Complexity justified six-figure contracts

That world is dying.

Here's what they all share:

1. Task-based or connector-based pricing that punishes growth
2. "Bi-directional" that's actually polling intervals and batch jobs stitched together
3. Implementation timelines measured in months
4. Platforms that require specialized talent just to connect to your existing stack

You can switch from MuleSoft to Workato.
You'll have the same problems with a different support team.

You can migrate from Workato to Boomi.
Different strengths on paper. Same latency in practice. Different invoice.

The problem isn't which iPaaS you choose.
The problem might be iPaaS itself.

We built Stacksync from first principles.

✅ It replaces: your iPaaS, your EDI provider. your reverse ETL, your event queues, your fragile sync scripts.
✅ True bi-directional sync. Sub-second latency. SQL-first.
✅ Pricing based on records, not tasks.

We didn't mean to replace that many tools.
Customers just kept asking.

If you've been vendor-hopping between the big three and wondering why nothing improves, now you know.

Same problem. Different logo.

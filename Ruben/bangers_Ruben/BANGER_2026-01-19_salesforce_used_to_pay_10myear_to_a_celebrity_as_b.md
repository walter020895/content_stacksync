Salesforce used to pay $10M/year to a celebrity as brand partner.
For 2026, they hired MrBeast from a tweet.

MrBeast posted he had a Super Bowl idea.
Marc Benioff replied publicly within 48 hours.

Later, MrBeast flew to Salesforce HQ, pitched his idea, and got the job.

This is rare in enterprise:

Workday spent millions getting Ozzy Osbourne, Joan Jett, Billy Idol, and Paul Stanley for their Super Bowl spot.

Traditional playbook: hire agency, book celebrities, produce ad.

Salesforce just let a creator reply to a tweet and take over.

I sell into the Salesforce ecosystem.
Watching them move like this is interesting.

Enterprise companies don't usually make $8M decisions from a X/Twitter thread.

Jimmy Donaldson, everyone in the comments is asking if this was staged. Was it?

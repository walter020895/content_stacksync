He'd created MySQL in 1995. Named it after his daughter "My"
Built it into the most popular open-source database in the world
Then Michael Widenius watched Oracle buy his life's work


Wikipedia. Facebook, YouTube, Google. All ran on MySQL 

Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion in 2008.
Then Oracle bought Sun.

The company MySQL spent 15 years competing against now owned it.

Widenius fought:

▪️Launched a "Save MySQL" petition.
▪️ Lobbied the European Commission to block the deal.
▪️ Testified before regulators.

"Oracle will destroy MySQL. Maybe not immediately. Maybe not obviously. But they'll starve it of resources and let it wither."

The EU approved the deal anyway.

So he forked his own database.

Recruited the original MySQL engineers who didn't want to work for Oracle.
Created a foundation so no single company could ever control it again.

Named it after his younger daughter.

MariaDB.

Today:
✅ Default database for Red Hat
✅ Default for Fedora
✅ Default for Debian
✅ Available on Ubuntu

When the core of Linux switched, millions of servers followed.

Widenius has three children: My, Max, and Maria.
All three inspired database names.

When Oracle took what he built, he didn't retire.

 He copied the code they couldn't stop him from copying.
 And built it again.

 The database named after his daughter My was captured.

 The one named after Maria was designed to be uncapturable.

I let Michael "Monty" Widenius confirm the story

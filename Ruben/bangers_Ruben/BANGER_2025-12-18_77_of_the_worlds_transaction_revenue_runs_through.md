77% of the world's transaction revenue runs through SAP.
Not "enterprise transactions." Not "B2B transactions."
THE WORLD'S transactions.

When your salary hits your bank account → probably SAP
When a hospital orders medicine → SAP
When an airline schedules your flight → SAP

It started in a small apartment in Mannheim, Germany.

5 engineers. Borrowed computers. Nights and weekends.

IBM had just killed their project. Months of work. Gone in a memo.
So, they quit.

They couldn't afford their own computer. 
So they worked nights at their first customer's data center—Imperial Chemical Industries.

No venture capital. No bank loans. Just customer cash flow.

52 years later:
 ~€270B market cap 
440,000 customers 
180 countries 
105,000 employees 

77% of world's transaction revenue

And they never chased hype.

No pivots to crypto. 
No rebrand every 6 months. 
No flashy Super Bowl ads.

Just: make the software work. Make it reliable. Make it scale.
German engineering applied to code. 

While "hot" startups rise and fall every 18 months, SAP has been running global commerce for 52 years. 

The people who work at SAP don't get the credit.

Nobody tweets "just deployed on SAP 🚀" 
Nobody makes TikToks about enterprise resource planning. 
LinkedIn influencers don't talk about "the SAP ecosystem."

But every single day, SAP employees keep the world running.

Every paycheck, shipment, transaction.

The invisible infrastructure of modern civilization.

Built by 5 engineers in a small apartment.

Running on values that never went out of style:

Reliability over hype & decades over quarters.

To everyone who works at SAP:

You don't trend on Twitter.
But you run the world.
